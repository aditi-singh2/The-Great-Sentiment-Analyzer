Incorrect description


Just a heads up - birko-flor sandals do not have a leather upper nor manmade leather on the inside. They are made out of synthetic upper that looks like leather and the inner lining is felt.Also, there are two options for the width - narrow and normal. Which Amazon does not distinguish.Although I had to return mine due to size issues, the description on the site is misleading at it's best.For those looking for the leather option, Arizona comes in premium leather upper lined with suede on the inside.

Comfortable as expected


I did my homework and measured my foot as per the guidance on the Birkenstock website to make sure I ordered the right size. I am a UK 4/EUR 37 usually but ordered a EUR 36 as per their site and fits like a glove. I believe this model only comes in narrow fit so I would really recommend measuring your feet as you may need to size up if they are wide.

Fake, stinky and terrible quality


Unsure if these are fakes! Bought in the summer and wore them for a couple weeks before the sole started to smell and turn an awful colour! I am a proud birk wearer and own several pairs so know for sure this doesn't usually happen.I emailed the shop to ask for their advice as to how to fix my problem because they are great looking birks... I just can't take the sandals off when I'm near anyone because they smell vile! No response regarding my email. Totally waste of money... When buying birks in the future I will buy from a shop instead!

How well they last and how excellent my feet look.


I have been wearing Birkenstock’s sandals since I was a teenager ,now at 84 the story is the same .....they are comfortable.,virtually indestructible.  And I really relish the colours o of my latest pair.My feet are in excellent shape due probably to my either going barefoot or using your product most of the time.I have concluded that these might be my last purchase but they have certainly done me proudSo many thanks Mary Blewitt

Very comfortable


My wife has worn Birkenstocks for some years and loves them and I had worn cheaper versions which I liked but they never seemed to last very long.  This year I was persuaded to invest in the real thing as she says some of her pairs have lasted years (then why does she need so many and in different colours?!).  So far I'm very impressed and didn't need to wear them in, even being able to walk the dog with them on.  They look smarter than my old ones and I have high hopes that they'll last a good while. She says they were a reasonable price but they aren't cheap.  Also, on her advice, I ordered a size smaller than me normal shoe size and have to admit that she was right!

Dangerous


I recently researched the best footwear for the foot issue metatarsalgia, which I suffer with. Birkenstock’s are supposed to help people who have this condition, as well as other foot problems.But I have an issue. I ordered my size, which came no problem. But it’s like trying to walk around the house with a canoe strapped to each foot! They’re massive!!! In fact, they are that big, you could strap one shoe to each end of a pole and go sailing in a real canoe!Don’t get me wrong, these are fairly well made, and if they were fitted properly they might have been good for my feet. But only if the buckles were fitted properly! When I first put them on, I was cut by a sharp piece of metal sticking through the strap from the buckle!!So, if you order a completely different size to yours (just guess, as it will be closer than your actual size) and you get lucky and they fit properly, and if they don’t shred a layer of skin from the top of your foot, these might be a decent buy. But these have already made my feet worse.

QUALITY OF BIRKOFLOR HAS PLUMMETED!


I don't know if Birkenstock are using a less environmentally damaging material for Birkoflor than they used to - but I've not had these for very long - and it has already started to split.  I've had previous pairs which have lasted for years and the material was much thicker and more flexible.  Also the soles are less good than previously - the front sort of crumbles away.  Perhaps they are trying to make them more profitably now and reducing the quality without hoiking the price too much - but honestly - at this rate you might be better buying the own label ones from a famous German supermarket!!

These are really nice, but, this is the 3rd pair I've had where the glue has failed


I have always liked these sandles; the ergonomic footbed feels weird at first, but rapidly just feels right, so I wear them around the house and garden. Sadly, I can't say I'll buy any again because, the glue fails. It's a shame because they're useless when the straps pull out from between the sole and foot bed, and the sole delaminates from the footbed at the front 1/2 too.I tried re-gluing these with gorilla glue (foaming polyurathane glue). It worked, but I wouldn't recommend it as the foam did expand to fill the gaps, but then pushed the pieces apart a little (soon crushed down again, but it was uncomfortable for a few hours). Anyhow, the re-gluing has steadily failed again. When it goes completely, they'll go in the bin.Sad to see the quality from this company has dropped in such an avoidable way. I'd have happily paid an extra £0.50p for the privelege of a pair that actually stayed together, but it happens with trainers too, so perhaps there's an industry problem with the glue they now use.

very large size but quality and comfy


I take a UK 4 / EU37, so I ordered the 37(UK4.5). I was worried I'd taken a size too large, as the shoes really are huge, but without being able to try the size below, I just kept the 37's. (Unfortunately that's the downside of buying online.) I had to poke new holes in the straps to keep the slippers from flapping around, and initially the shoe, although moulded with toe-dents and raised arch bits, gave me blisters straight away after a 30 minute walk. I still don't wear them for long walks, as they just rub in the wrong places for me (another sign that I should have taken a size smaller), but they are great for the garden and around the house. Well built and feel they will last a very long time.If you take a normal size UK4/EU37, I really recommend taking the size below (UK3.5).I have normal-slightly-wide feet, 22-23cm long. UK4 usually fits me absolutely fine, unless a narrow fit.

It will take time to get use to them


As I said above - it will take some time to get use to them.  They stay on your feet easily (which was a concern).  They only negative is wear them around the house first to get use to them, wear socks as the sole (or insole) part actually rubbed my arch and caused some discomfort, but with socks everything is gravy.18/04/21 updateThey are simply fantastic. They seem to have moulded to my foot and are extremely comfortable. They don't smell and are very hard wearing.04/08/21They are still very comfortable however they are starting to split at the corner of the first strap, on the inside step-see the photo for details. It makes sense seeing how that where the foot bends.My advice is to get Birkenstock but make sure you get one when the leather doesnt bend with the foot when taking a step.

Lovely sandals but not for me...


The outline of the sole fits the outline of my foot nearly perfectly but the topography and rigidity of the sole feels like it will harm my feet.I don't have arch support when I walk barefoot. Haven't our feet have evolved so that our arches receive no direct contact pressure? When my running shoes wear to the point that I feel the sole contact my arches I bin them but evidently Birkenstock consider this a benefit?I've worn the Arizona EVA daily since buying them about a year ago and find them to be the most comfortable footwear I have ever had but they are much softer. I have now tried the cork/latex/leather version in both a 265 (as recommended by Birkenstock) and a 270. My longest foot is ~267mm and widest is ~257mm (circumference).I didn't even fasten the straps on them such was the discomfort of the sole. Returned. Amazon service exemplary - such that I feel guilty returning them. EDIT: Be aware that if you return an item via the Amazon Locker service, you have no proof of the return! A month after returning these, they still show as ""in transit"" and Amazon has sent me a reminder email to return them. Unacceptable.

Birkenstock Arizona


I have been using Birkenstock (Arizona model) since I was a young teenager and when my last pair was practically destroyed, after more than a decade, I bought a new one. I chose the black coloured version. Very comfortable and suitable for all seasons (I use it only at home). Excellent value for money! I purchased it at 30% less than the price in Birkenstock/physical stores. It arrived as scheduled (with Prime, the day after my order was sent). Great product - highly recommended! Amazon service impeccable as usual! Five stars to both.

Lovely sandals but...


Very nice sandals but despite following the Birkenstock size guide and confirming by email with Birkenstock a size two sizes smaller than I usually wear in non-Birkenstock shoes, the sandals are indeed too small. The returns process - something that previously gave me cause to worry and on this occasion more so - edit: that said, the sandals have been returned and I've been refunded.I've tried a few pairs of Birkenstock Arizona and Milano sandals and the quality varies enough to be quickly noticeable. Damaged / separating leather, glue smeared beyond contact surfaces, contact surfaces not glued in places, holes for buckles not evenly spaced and beginning in different places on the straps and two pairs that I have bought have not been size labelled correctly. For the money paid, in my opinion, not good enough. Birkenstock customer service by email is also very poor.Amazon service is excellent - I think it is beyond what can be reasonably expected.Edited as I think originally I was too harsh on Amazon and too lenient on Birkenstock. I have returned my last pair of Birkenstock sandals, it seems, after many pairs tried, they aren't for me. Marketing wizardry? I'm inclined to think so.

Birkenstock sizing? Here's the answer :-)


*Review edited 08Jan2016Summary:These are good Birkos which have replaced a 10-year-old pair and seem as well built as ever. Personally I prefer the harder footbed, not the cushioned one on this product, but it's a 50/50 matter: for me the harder (original) footbed offers better arch/sole support and doesn't grip my socks* as much as the cushioned footbed. However, you may find that the cushioned footbed is a little warmer and easier on the feet. Since buying this pair I found that Amazon sells the Arizona with both types of footbed, so look around a bit for the version you want. Whichever you choose, you will find superior build quality and good ergonomics. If you are a 'first-timer' with this type of sandal, perhaps the cushioned footbed would be a good way to start.Sizing and fit:My first pair, bought around 10 years ago, was UK9 (men) which translates in Birko/European language to EU43. I lost some weight, so for the new pair under review I chose size EU42 (UK8). Both old and new pairs have the image of a foot in outline on the footbed: this means 'regular' fit. (A solid image on the footbed would mean 'narrow'.) Side by side, the new Birkos (EU42) are shorter than the EU43s (duh!) so there's less overhang at the heel and toe and I am less likely to crash them into the furniture. When they were new and I was breaking them in, I found that my toes sometimes crept over the 'ledge' at the toe end, but now all is fine after some adjustments to the straps.Below I give a link to what appears to be the Birkenstock UK website page about sizing. Actually, it's pretty easy - the Europeans do it better than we do in the UK! In Europe there's just one range of sizes so, irrespective of gender or age, whatever size your foot happens to be, that's the size you choose. You'll see how this works if you visit the link.www.birkenstock.co.uk/Article/View/articleCode/Sizing/In case Amazon zaps the above URL, here it is in a different format. To use, replace [dot] with a dot and delete all spaces:www [dot] birkenstock [dot] co [dot] uk /Article /View /articleCode /Sizing/*Yes, I wear socks with sandals. Once you've had sunburnt feet, you don't want them again :-) Nearly a year down the road, the cushioned footbeds have become smoother and less grippy and I am pretty pleased with them.

Comfortable, durable and very cost effective (just remember to adjust the straps)


I was a bit nervous about paying the price for these shoes as they are priced at the upper end of what I wanted. Indeed, when I got them I was also initially slightly worried as they didn't seem to fit properly. But after a couple of days I would never go back to the cheap and cheerful alternatives. These are excellent! The material they are made of is very high quality. The two adjustable straps mean they fit very snuggly (my initial problem was the straps weren't adjusted correctly). I have also (foolishly) worn them into the sea, but they have remained undamaged and are still almost like new. I would therefore highly recommend this product.

Really nice sandals.They look stylish and great colour. Overall first impressions are they look great with great underfoot groves to help with the feel under foot.I really like the sole very gripping.The feel under foot is great and over time moulds more to your foot.We really looked into the sizing and had to go a little size bigger than normal for a good fit.

UK Men size 12 = 44


I'm a UK 12 and worked out I would probably need a 44 or a 45 in these from the reviews.  Took a gamble on 44 and as it happens whilst they were being shipped to me I got a chance to try some on in a shoe shop.  The 45 was too big and the 44 was just about right.  I think in an ideal world i would want a 44.5 but they dont do that size.  They arrived today and the 44 is the same size as the 44 I tried on in the store.  My feet stay within the sandal well without touching the surrounding bits that rise, just.  45 would have been another 5mm longer and would have been too big.  I understand that as the cork squishes a little more room will be freed up.  I think my feet are an average width, never notice probs with regular shoes so went with M and when tightening the buckles I am one notch from the narrowest.  Therefore i could have probably got away with N but certainly now W.  That said where my feet sit they are comfy so N may have been too tight.What else is there to say?  they are good looking and although stiff now I know will soften up.  Nice quality pair of sandals that were £44 in high street.So for sizing.  I would guess UK men 9-10=42, 10-11=43, 11-12=44..  something like that.

Even Nicer than I Expected.


This is my third pair or Arizonas this year - having only just discovered them. After a lot of research, decided that Eu40 Narrow fit is the size for me (I wear U.K. 7-7.5 AA width or U.S.A. 9-9.5 AA) and my foot fits comfortably inside the footbed without spilling out over the rim in this size.  I much prefer the real leather versions and now have a Smooth Leather pair (Navy), a Natural Leather pair (White) and now this new Oiled Leather version in Habana.  Oddly the Habana pair look a little neater than the White ones (for all that when I put them sole to sole they measure exactly the same!) - it must be an optical illusion!  Anyway, the Habana are a gorgeous dark chocolatey brown and the finish on the oiled leather make them look almost satiny and they are finished off with most attractive coppery toned buckles! All in all I'm very pleased, the service was excellent and the price very good too.  I wish more were available in genuine leather and might look out for Milanos next (i.e. Arizonas with a back strap)! By way of interest - I went to a shoe shop to try a pair of Rio (I think!) but they only had the Regular width available and they were vastly too wide for me - but they were a women specific style so I am convinced that there are generally only the 2 footbeds and, therefore, the Narrow footbed in the Unisex sandal (like Arizona) is also the same as it would be in the Women specific versions. Also have discovered that Birkenstock do a width called ""Medium"" -for in-between feet - but only in selected styles. For those like me with very narrow feet, it is possible to add extra holes to tighten the straps further if needed and after the ""breaking in"" period they become really comfortable and I like the quirky look (although I also think this Habana version is also a bit smart!).

Birkenstock is Quality Brand


Birkenstock Sandals are products my whole family wear. The cork foot-bed with its thin layer of fleece topping make this foot wear a comfortable while also being very durable sandal. For those not familiar with these type of sandals they may be uncomfortable to start with but after being worn for a period of time and exposed to the heat from your feet they mold/adapt to the wearer feet; This makes them uniquely comfortable.

UNWEARABLE, AWFUL


I can imagine that these sandals could be very comfortable if your feet were the perfect shape and size for them. However; I found them to be the most uncomfortable I have  worn.I found that when my heel sat comfortably in the pre-formed hollow, the built up instep was wonderful, but the ridge for my toes sat midway across them, which dug into them when I walked.. It really hurt.It is very risky buying pre-moulded shoes, the chances of your feet fitting what the manufacturer's consider to be the right shape is a gamble.There was also no receipt, returns document or paperwork of any kind in the packaging.If you want a pair of these, don't buy them on-line. You will probably need to try several pairs on.. I am a size 8, and every shoe that I have purchased in the last 40 years have fitted fine, but these are unwearable, and not cheap.I am really disappointed in them

WATCH THE SIZING ON THESE


ordered the size 44 for my husband as according to the sizing info it said this was for a size 10.  However, when they arrived they were too big.  I had to return them and order the size 43 instead, which according to the info said it was a size 9??  My husband was initially very disappointed and I was annoyed that I had ordered as per the sizing recommendation page and they were too big and I had to go through the hassle of returning the original ones.  I don't usually have to return anything.the new ones arrived yesterday and even though the sizing when I ordered said they would be a size 9 - they are indeed a size 10 and fit correctly.  How confusing is that!  they are lovely sandals however, and look great on - when you get the right size.

Unlike some other big-name products, these shoes have never deteriorated in quality.


I've been buying Birkenstocks for many years because my idea of a good shoe is one that protects your foot while feeling as much as possible as if you were walking barefoot. The remarkable thing about backless Birkenstocks is that they are so well shaped that they don't constantly slide or fly off your feet. You can run, swing or dance in them, and in summer I walk for miles across rough fields in them. They last for years even if used constantly and their soles grip well even when severely worn. The one thing that I think the makers could improve upon is the glue used to join the cork to the rubber layer of the sole, because this has failed on me twice. I have to admit, though, that this has only happened after years of splashing through water and mud in them!

best sandals in the world


I wear these sandals every day of the year.  My last pair lasted 3 years.  Glad to see there have been no changes to this product in that time as there is nothing left to perfect.  Despite having no backs... this sandal stays well placed even if you need to run.  After about 2 years the bottom rubber starts to separate from the cork...but it takes another year of battering before a new pair finally has to be purchased.  The sandal will feel a bit 'hard' when you first use them...as they cork molds to your foot...so give it about 2 weeks to wear in.  The longer you wear them...the more comfortable they become.

Comfortable, look good


I've worn Birkenstock sandals/clogs in the summer for a few years now, and these are just as comfortable as the previous ones I've had.  I don't really know what else to say about them.. I like the black glitter, it's a bit different without being too ""bling"".  I find the ones with multiple straps more comfortable than those with just one strap, as they sit closer to the foot and don't ""flap"" as much with each step.  I always take a size smaller than I'd usually order in Birkenstock, I am usually a 38 or size 5, but 37 or size 4 fits me perfectly.  Overall, am really happy with these.

Nice sandals, but don't last long


Needed some new sandals and thought I'd try some birkenstocks. At first they were really uncomfortable but after a few wears they improved. I'm a bit dissapointed as after little over a month of wear the straps are coming unglued from the sole and the edges are now rubbing my feet and causing blisters. Ive not got them wet or washed them so not sure why this has happened. I was hoping that as they are quite pricey they would be good quality and last a while but it looks like I'm going to have to buy something else now which is a shame because I was starting to really like them.

Bargain Birkies!


I have given this product a rating of 4 stars because the sandals are very well made and the materials are of a high quality.  The colour shown online is a true representation of the actual material colour,The reason I did not give them a 5 star rating is that the sizing is a little on the large side - despite me ordering a size below my normal show size as suggested in a previous purchaser's review.  Perhaps I should also have requested the ""Narrow"" width fit or perhaps it's just the way ""Birkies"" are made or the fact that I have'nt got used to them yet.  Either way it wasn't such an issue to cause me to return them.They are very comfortable though and the price I paid online compared to the prices you see on the high street was excellent.

Painful at first, but great now!


These sandals had a very significant breaking in period for me - for the first 3-4 days of wearing them they were quite painful, as the moulding that is supposed to match your foot's shape doesn't quite match it exactly. It feels almost orthodpedic, but I found it difficult to walk for more than 2-3 hours a day, as I am used to. After this period though, the sandals break in beautifully, and now they are extremely comfortable. Great design, the sole stains quite quickly from its initial colour but this looks attractive and ""aged"" rather than dirty.

sole lacked soul


I know some people live in their Birkenstocks but they just did not suit me.  I found the moulded sole uncomfortable, even after a few minutes.  It is stiff and I prefer a softer, more pliable shoe, also the moulding just felt too uncomfortable, coming in all the wrong places for my foot.  The straps could be adjusted to fit any width of foot and were made of relatively soft leather.  I found the distribution of the straps good for me as there was one high across the instep which held the foot.  Afraid I sent mine back after a relatively short trial as I decided I would not get on with the stiff, moulded sole.

These are the narrow fit, not regular


The product description says it is regular width but these are actually the narrow width. On the Birkenstock website it explains that when the foot symbol printed on the shoe is filled in, it is the narrow fit (as opposed to the outlined symbol which is regular), and even the shoes in the picture for this product show that it is filled in, so it's not like they just sent me the wrong size.

Quick service from Bells Shoes, Buxton, Derbyshire, through Amazon. Good price and fast service wins the day! These shoes are soooooo comfy, and the more that you wear them, the comfier they get.

Not very comfortable


I had read that it takes time for them to mould to your feet - I’m still waiting. They are hard on the soles of your feet and on first wearing them for half Aday gave me a blister on the instep. The thing I really dislike ( and it may be just me?) - they make my feet very sweaty😟 I will persevere as friends have said it takes time for them to feel comfortable.

This is my first pair of Birkenstocks and will be purchasing more shortly. They are just as described and arrived in perfect condition. The only advice I would give is to try a pair on in the shop to give you an idea on sizing then order them, which is what I did and found it very useful. They do need bedding in when you first get them but no different to purchasing any new footwear. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Gorgeous sandals but slightly narrow, they are normally perfect fit for me, then realised I had been sent a narrow fitting pair.Went back into site to check, there is no choice of fitting to choose from so much watch for this. They will probably give a little,otherwise, beautiful print and a bargain price, I have dozens of pairs of Birkenstocks as I have a really bad back and Plantar Fascitis, which is excruciating in the winter, come spring pop on Birkis and the pain is a lot better!!!

Excellent - comfortable and durable


When I was ordering this, I got a message on screen saying that I had last ordered this item seven years ago. During that time I have worn the previous pair every summer and on winter holidays. They are looking well worn (mainly due to water damage) after 7 years but would last longer if I was prepared to put up with it. The water damage is due to the soles being cork and although the cork is coated they are not made for wearing in the rain during an English summer. I have also worn them when jet washing the patio so they have had a hard life. This is not to criticise them, they are very comfortable and 7 years of use (and abuse) from a pair of sandals is very good.

I have had theses before in Leather and wanted a sustainable alternative. However these have now split (see photos) after barely 8 months of casual wear indoors.

Comfortable!


This pair of slippers feel great. Don't be put off if they feel too hard initially. I think it'll normally take a few weeks for the soles to soften and to mould to the shape of your feet. After breaking them in, they'll be the most comfortable pair of slippers that you'll ever have!A word of warning though. When you order, remember to check out the sizes on the Birkenstocks website. My feet measure 260mm normal width. When I buy shoes, I normally wear US size 8.5 or 9, UK size 8 or 8.5 and Europe size 42 or 42.5. However, I needed a size 40 for the Birks. So remember folks, when buying stuff online, remember to check the EXACT specifications to save yourself from sizing trouble. Kudos for Birkenstocks to put up an exact foot size chart up. All footwear companies should do this instead of the typical numbering that they use which is not precise enough.

Check out the width sizing


I'm very pleased with these, finally! It took me 4 orders before I worked out the sizing - although I don't have narrow feet I still ended up needing a slim fit - also called narrow but the only way to be sure of this is to check the foot symbol on the shoes. The amazon pages don't always make it all that clear. Unless you have very wide feet I'd recommend thinking about slim fit.Well done to Amazon for their free returns and prompt returns repayment.

Birkenstocks - the original and the best.


My wife's newest favourite possession. They fit her perfectly and are very comfy. For the first few days they threatened to rub a little, but she avoided that by applying a blister-stick to the tighter areas each time she put them on and within a few days they were no longer rubbing.I have applied leather balm to these to condition the leather, and we bought a ""cork renew"" product to re-coat the cork as the protection wears away through use.

These are probably my 5th pair of Birks, yes, I'm a very big fan!However, watch out for sizing, I'm usually a 9 to 9.5 and I always go for a UK 8. Check out the Birkenstock UK website if you're not sure, that seems to be correct!

Don't buy anything else!


I wear uk size 8 and ordered a uk size 7 on the reviews and recommendations of others on Amazon, initially I thought I had made a mistake and that they were too small, but as the week passed they flattened out and fit beautifully.  I love them, they replaced a pair that I had worn to death for the past couple of years.

Great, although slightly bigger than expected!


After a lot of thought I bought my usual foot number and it came slightly bigger, thankfully I could adjust them and I wore them for the whole summer and they are fine. Very chunky and resistant, super comfortable. Only a bit disappointed as there are some stains of water that didn't really come out, maybe cause they are not real leather... other than that, very happy.

Birkenstocks a great friend for your feet


I have been diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and my podiatrist recommended Birkenstock Amazon along with some stretching and rehab exercises. My condition has improved enormously in just a few days. I wear my Birkenstocks at every opportunity. The relief from pain is fantastic. I would recommend these shoes to anyone, once broken in they are better than slippers.

My first pair of Birkenstock sandals. Have been comparing prices for months and this purchase came in so much cheaper than other online vendors and high street stores. Delivery date was spot on. Well packaged and the sandals fit perfectly. From the info that came with the delivery it looked very straightforward to return if unsuitable. I am a very happy customer. Already thinking about a second pair in a different colour. Highly recommended.

I have owned a couple pf pairs of these shoes.Why pay £45 (in the sale) for non leather in the shops when you can buy genuine leather for £36 with free P+P on Amazon.The non leather Berkenstocks are ""OK"", but these (leather option) are the cats whiskers.Not all shoes suit my feet but these are put on and forget.I have had both normal and narrow fitting, for a normal foot chose narrow, there is still plenty of adjustment in the straps. If you order normal, you might find that the staps will not adjust tight enough.I am normally a 42 (UK 8) but having ordered my normal size i found them to be too big.

Just what the Doktor ordered


This transaction and the product overreached my expectations. The price compared to the RRP was great, delivery was swift and the Birkenstocks are better than I imagined. These genuine  Arizonas replaced some 'fakenstocks' (that did last eight summers!) I did some research online and in an actual unsuspecting shoe shop and decided to go for a 41, whereas I normally take a 42. They really couldn't fit me better, the leather's soft from the outset and they're so comfortable.It's a pity that I'll have to stop wearing them soon as it's getting a bit cold now, because everybody should know; socks are always gonna be a no-no!

Disappointed that for the price the straps aren't leather! Not able do them up tight enough on foot either.

A strange fit with some odd design choices.


These sandals are quite a narrow fit, and have a very strange ridge / recess around the toes which takes some getting used to. They have caused me blisters on my instep as it is difficult to position your foot so that the toe ridge is in the right place without having the sandals loose enough so allow rubbing on the underside of your foot. I can't recommend these at all.

Whether it is the style I am unsure, but I have a toe-post design of Birkenstock which fits perfectly and when measured there is no difference in the food bed so I have put it down to the top design.

I love birkenstock sandals. I have these in black and brown and went for the white when i saw them at a good price. Since I've already worn this style before, these were comfortable out of the box. I recommend that you buy your regular size in a normal width (unless you really do have narrow feet!). If you are new to birkenstock they probably feel a bit loose and big at first. Your toes shouldn't touch the ends and if you buy the wrong size you won't get the benefit of the arch support etc. Just take a little bit of getting used to.

I'm really pleased with these- they came really quickly


I'm really pleased with these- they came really quickly, look and feel amazing on my feet. I have havd birkenstocks before and they are super comfy. My only qualm with buying these particular shoes was that the product description doesn't make it clear that the upper is made out of Birko-Flor Nubuck which is a synthetic nubuck- it's not real leather and is essentially made out of plastic. The description definitely doesn't mention this and while i'm not particularly bothered because they still look great, if you had your heart set on leather then buy somewhere else!

Love them but why did they have to become fashionable and shoved the price up😁


Staple item of my summer wardrobe I would not be without them. Shocking how fashion makes them more expensive than they used to be.. I remember when I used to get laughed at for wearing my Birkenstocks...  Still the most comfortable thing you can out in your feet when the heat kicks in 😊

Great new styling, same comfort!!


I am extremely pleased with my purchase and the price!!  I always buy a size smaller than my shoe size for Birkenstocks and these were no different so I am a 5 but bought a 4 or 37.  They seem a little narrower than my old plain leather Arizona Birkenstocks - this was not clear in the description but I think they are ""narrow"" though actually that fits my foot better.  The colour is lighter than the standard straight leather Arizona Birkenstocks going towards a tan but I love that they are different and have the funky orange soles!!  Overall very happy and nice to have a variation on a theme!

SO SO comfy.  Excellent fit and just like all my other Birkenstick they mould to your feet.

I wore these every day for three months straight while working as a summer camp counsellor in Canada. They're so comfy and durable. However, they took several weeks to break in and cut my feet a lot in the process. This probably could have been easily avoided if I broke them in over a longer period of time. The next time I need a new pair of summer shoes I'll 100% buy Birks again.

Too Large


Shoes were far too big, had to return and get a pair 2 sizes down which I bought from a shop. Would recommend trying these sandals on before buying rather than buying online as I have been told they are generally made at larger sizes than expected. I always wear a size 5.5 and have bought Birkenstocks size 4 which fit perfectly!! Other than that they are a brilliant comfortable sandal.

Would definitely recommend sizing down


Bought these Birkenstocks for my holiday to Brazil in February as I wanted something comfy to walk about in. I have literally lived in these ever since! They do come up very big, I am usually a size 4 and I had to send them back for a size 3. They were miles too big, even with the buckles tightened the most they could go, they were practically falling off my feet. Would definitely recommend sizing down. These are a great price too, a lot cheaper than some other online retailers.

Good product, really helps my feet.


These sandals are a little on the large size, I ordered the size I thought, but should have ordered the one size down.The fact they have two straps across keeps the foot in place. I have a pair of Schols but they only have the one strap, these are better.Easy to wear and feel good.

great shoes but rubbish sizing....


It was my own fault, even though I know that im a shoe size 36 in european sizing, I checked the Amazon size chart and it said 38 was a 5, i checked my other birkenstocks and they said 36, I ummed a bit then thought perhaps it was because they were a different style, surely Amazon would know what size was what, I went with Amazon and received a pair of massive shoes that i had to return, now have ordered size 36 and surprise they fit and are fantastic, These are fantastic lovely and comfortable sandals, i re ordered in brown as there was no blue, I am happy....

Birkenstock Suede Taupe in size 8 narrow fit Sandals!


I first bought these sandals as they look more beige than grey, in the photo's, however they are grey and the pictures aren't really showing the correct colour. But i do like them and will search for the Beige colour i want. I also tried a size down first which was a mistake! These fit to your regular size! I got these in a narrow fit and they are a good fit! I think it will take a little time 'to break them in' as they are rubbing a little, but they will be comfortable, i'm sure.The service from Amazon was really good as i needed to make an exchange, excellent service and a quality product Thanks.

size matters


I'm a UK size 5 so after reading reviews I brought a size 4 in narrow width and it fit perfect to a t, the only problem with a smaller size is it is a perfect fit to your foot so if you do want a little space then stick to your original shoe size. I love it, such good quality and comfy but next time I'm going to buy a 5 because I do want that little extra space

I've had a pair of Birkies for three years, worn outdoors in the summer and indoors all year round and have found them extremely comfortable (the footbed moulds to the shape of your foot) and warm in winter - in fact warmer than fur lined slippers!

I'm usually a uk 6 but after reading the reviews I went for the 38 which is a uk5 and in the N narrow version and they fit me perfectly. Love them, so much cheaper than in the stores. Gonna buy them in white too. Happiness all around!

These are my second pair of Birkenstocks, so knowing that the first ones fitted fine, I just ordered the same size.  As a size 43 male with feet that come up on the wide side, this size in the normal width Birkenstocks gives for a perfect fit with just the right amount of space on the footbed to accommodate the movement of the foot. The sandals are supremely comfortable, secure on the foot and ideal for walking around in.

Too narrow


I am a Birkenstock enthusiast but after my second return due to the non accurate description I couldn't be bothered to return this as well. It might be a 44 EU size but it's a narrow fit and I had put additional holes on the straps so I could slip in comfortably. It is still quite narrow, my only hope is that it will stretch a bit.

Am a UK size 9 (43) but the sandals in this size were too big. Received a prompt refund after sending them back. Took a chance and ordered the size 8 (42) and  they were much better fit. Would recommend wearing them indoors for a few days to break them in and they soon become really comfortable!

Bought these as a present for my brother. He is usually a size 44/43, I was advised by a friend to buy a size smaller. So I ordered the 43 and they ended up being far too big. However I exchanged them for the 42 and now they fit well. The whole return/exchange process was really easy.

Best summer shoes I've owned


For about a week when you first get there, it's a good idea to wear socks because it is not always comfortable. There is a break-in period where the slides mold to the shape of your feet, but once it does it's tough to want to wear anything else. I've been wearing these all summer long and I love them. They are pretty durable, extremely comfortable and I wear them basically everywhere. If you're a person that loves to wear slides, this is well worth the purchase.

Great product and great service


Ordered these at about 6pm on Tuesday and they arrived at about 08:30 today, Thursday - and that was with Amazon's standard free service. So full marks again Amazon for a fantastic turnaround on delivery.I normally wear Ecco shoes in size 45 and so I'm glad that I tried a pair of these on before I ordered because as the other reviews suggest, I needed a smaller size in Birkenstock I've got a 44M and they fit perfectly.The only slight disappointment is that I thought that they would have leather uppers, but they don't - probably my own fault for not looking closely enough at all of the adverts here. Anyway they don't actually look synthetic in anyway, after all this is a quality product and it looks and feels great.The footbed is leather lined and after all that's the bit that my foot will have most contact with and after all, they are sandals so I don't think that the soft lined synthetic upper will cause me any problems at all.If the other reviews are all correct I'll probably be back for a leather pair in a few weeks time :-)

Totally worth the cost!!


I was hesitant to spend the money to purchase these Birkenstock sandals despite suffering from flat feet however after trying them out, I'm in love with them. The first week of wearing may be solid and firm to walk however during this period, I found the cork material was molded around my foot creating the perfect fitting sandal. I would totally recommend this to anyone!

Check your sizes before you order!!


Been wearing these for many years but usually bought in a shop, size 39. after reading the reviews about sizes I ordered carefully under UNISEX shoes. I ordered a 37 which seemed the correct size (6/7) stated. When they came they were not the correct size, so I ordered up to a 38 which have come today and they are still on the small side, I should have just ordered the 39 like my other pairs. Might be best to try on in shops or just order your usual European size.these shoes are wide and comfy and the more you wear them the more comfy they become and they last ages, coping well with rain and all British weathers!I was mega impressed how easy it was to send the small ones back and have the new ones delivered quickly. Not keen on Amazon usually tbh but fair play to them for the no fuss experience this was.

Absolutely Brilliant!


I ordered these on Monday and they came today. I have two pairs of Birkenstock mules and whilst they are a nice fit i always feel they will fall off my feet!I have fibromyalgia which affects the whole of my body with pain and the worst thing is my feet and trying to find comfortable and supportive footwear. I thought I'd give these a try, the minute I put them on i could not believe how comfy they are. They are going to last for ever so will do several summers being white, Im now going to get them in the blue and they will double up as slippers!

Check the size!


I ordered these for the man in my life &, having read the reviews, I ordered a smaller size than he normally takes.He is usually a UK 10/European 44. I initially ordered a 43, but it was far too big.We then measured his feet & ordered a 41, which fits perfectly!Make sure you look at the size instructions & scroll down to the unisex size guide.I'd recommend getting the ruler out first time!Also, I didn't immediately notice that these aren't leather. I thought Birko-Flor was a style name, not a manmade fibre.It looks fine, though, so it's not a problem.He's pleased with the sandal & I'm pleased that he's no longer wearing trainers & socks with his shorts!

Great product, choose your model carefully.


Great sandal, no more backache. I put my crocs in the garbage. I also bought a second pair of the same, but with leather straps instead of suede. They hold up better and I can slip my feet in instead of having to bend to hold the suede straps. Both models are equally comfortable  after a few hours wear.

Birks are the best


Always had Birks ugly but ergonomic and now even fashionable and yes I am not a teenage girl but a 55 year old guy and yes I wear it with socks at this point I don't care.  But the most important thing is that for more then a 100 years hardly any changes cause they got it right the first time.  Nothing even comes close for being good for your feet.

Sizing Options are not clear


Ordered “size 10” (the only option) for my daughter, and received a size 43. So basically a size 10 in men’s (luckily they fit my partner and he’s a fan of Birkenstock’s) If the option been properly in EU numbers I would have ordered a 41 and gotten the right size. Kind of bummed, and having a hard time finding the right size option to buy. Guess I’ll just order direct instead.

Read the Birkie size chart!


As these are unisex you need to read that section of the size chart and measure the length of your feet to ensure you get the correct size.Birkenstock stipulate that there should be space at the front & back of the foot[& sides] so that your foot is within the moulded insole. As these are not sized the same as UK  womens' shoes I purchased size 40 when I'm usually size 8 which would be a 42 & I think they are about right.The uppers are leather which is not always the case with Birkies,mine are 'Stone' which is a nice neutral/khaki shade & the buckles are a coppery/black colour..Price was excellent too at £29

Good Value.  Need breaking in.


I ordered these shoes for my son in his normal size 11.  They are much larger than his previous pair of Birkenstock sandals, but just about wearable.  These sandals are excellent value for money in comparison to the leather birkenstocks, but they don't seem to be as pliable as we have experienced previously, and it literally took him a week or so to break these in sufficiently to be able to walk far.  These sandals are perfect for a man, but not something that I would wear, as they are very clunky in appearance.  Whilst all birkies are of a similar design, the women's ones are slightly shallower and neater than these.

huge fit but once you find the size, v comfortably indeed.


Had to send two pairs back as the sizing is huge! I'm a 39 euro size 6uk and ended up with a 37/uk4! However, super comfortable and the seller was excellent with free returns and drop off at local store. Definitely treat yourself to a pair, once you get past the initial foot bedding in few days it's like you aren't wearing shoes. There are many copied designs out there but pay a little more and get the quality of the real ones. You won't be disappointed

Great product poorly listed


I ordered various sizes and widths, this is not something thats made in the UK that there are narrow fit or regular. This process took ages due to Amazons poor listing of the products. I had to find out from manufacturer which ones were narrow and get the product code and match it against the Amazon listings.Eventually they arrived (promised delivery date  passed, again Amazons fault) And the size 11  UK regular fit was perfect. To be honest with my feet I could also have worn the narrow as there is about half a cm of a difference. Some people were saying to size down as they feel big but its necessary to have the space to let your feet spread out.Another gripe is Amazon dont state which ones are leather and which arent. I got the leather ones. My partner has the non leather variety which are also good quality.They look and feel great and will last for years. They do take your feet a few days to get used to the moulded sole shape but they are now worn daily at home and are cozy.

Nice shoes to own


These sandals look great, and are basically comfortable, but whilst the right foot is feels great, the left foot rubbed on the top on first wearing which left a nasty blister, and for some reason the top of my right foot is very painful, and therefore I wouldn't buy this type of shoe again.  I'm sure this is some oddity to me, and others wouldnt experience the same problem.
