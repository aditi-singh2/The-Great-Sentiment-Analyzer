Best for beginners / learner guitar (considering the price)


As a layman (who doesn't know much about guitars) this product is awesome... It feels good, it sounds good, the strings are good... Before buying it, I researched a little bit and came to a conclusion that this the best (considering the MRP) beginners / learning guitar you can have. Ofcourse there are one or two things which may bother you once you learn more about guitar and chords and frets. But if you are just starting, this is the one to go with.

High action! Hurts fingers Might deter you from practicing guitar


pros:* The guitar has fair sound for its price.* Looks goodCon:* Action is too high, double of what is expectedAction is the distance between the frets and the strings or how high the strings are. If this is too high you would have to press very hard to get a good sound and this will hurt your fingers.Action measured at 12th fret was 0.5mm should be about 0.28mm, ill attach an imageYou might have heard playing guitars usually hurts the fingers but with this it hurts more than it should.As beginner this experience might deter you from learning guitar or practicing more.Learning guitars could be difficult but it shouldn't be a pain.If you are beginner buy guitar from trusted brand accompanied by someone experienced.

I'm beginner , I watched videos on YouTube and bought this product but I don't know why this doesn't sound like I watched on YouTube.So after a day of my order delivery I took it to expert of instruments she said it is completely worth less only we can use it for photography and child play , this sure looks like guitar but doesn't sound like it, it's material is worst .Please don't buy even if u r a beginner please buy bit expensive than this because it's material is so bad and u will waste your money.

Just blindly buy it. Recommended ( Pro )


Writing a review after extensive usage for over two years. This guitar is absolutely one of the best buys ever. Rs. 2000 is an absolute steal. I have a Fender FC and a Yamaha F310 and bought this one since I relocated to another city for two years, and wanted a spare guitar I can junk.Guitar is in perfect shape and I won't be junking it ! Stays tuned for atleast 2-3 days with lots of playing (8-10 hours). Stays tuned afterward too but may need to fine tune. Tone quality is decent. Again, an absolute steal for 2000 rupees.Among companies like Juarez, most of their guitars are good but there can be a chance that you may get 1/10 pieces that are defective. Else it you get a well made piece, this is a great buy

I'm reviewing this after 2 years.If you don't know how to play guitar you may like this at first impression.I thought I'll learn playing this then later buy a good one but this was worse decision.After playing for 3-4 months action got high and can't be correct because there is no truss rod.I recommend you do not ever buy any guitar without truss rod and also buy a decent guitar even for learning.It's not matter you are beginner or master everyone should have good gear.True thing is that have started playing with this guitar only so faced too much difficulty I wish you don't need to face the same.I'm Engineer and you know every engineer have a dream to play guitar üòÅI recommend you to buyCort ad810Cort af510Yamaha f310/f280 (both is same)These all are under 10K

¬†The space between strings and fretboard is too much, Hence it will start making a buzzing sound within days, I got it yesterday and today it's making buzzing sound ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è also due to too much space you'll need to press the strings way too hard which will hurt your fingers plus it makes playing guitar difficult. Action of guitar is not good. Truss road is not adjustable. Would not recommend this at all. Specially to beginners.It's cheap and looks good. Packaging and delivery service were also good. You can prolly buy it for photoshoot or as a showpiece though.  Don't buy it for playing or learning guitar.

About the best bang for your buck


I'm writing this a couple of days after delivery, and so far, I haven't had any trouble.Delivery-I'm very pleasantly surprised; it arrived within 24 hours as promised. Prime ftw.The packing was immaculate. A hard box, with the guitar covered and bubble-wrapped. The guitar bag was wrapped up in the box, along with the plectrums (0.71 mm), extra strings, and the guitar strap. The guitar itself was largely intact; it had a couple of tiny scratches, but they're so small, I couldn't even get a clear enough picture. It has metal strings and the knobs turn smoothly without resistance. Tuning the guitar didn't take long, and the resonance sounds pretty great.It's a simple sort of an instrument, without the frills of a Fender acoustic to adjust volume and tone, but for about 2k, with all the add-ons, I think it's an absolute steal.

Overall Review.


I have recieved this product and after analyzing the points are :-1. PACKING:- the packing was so good that there wasn't a scratch or dent on the outer part.2. CLOSING:- The guitar was enclosed in polythene, then a thick translucent white polythene cover, then by a cardboard box, first by the seller Juarez and over it amazon branding polythene.3. INSIDES:- there was a guitar, A cover, Two Pick 0.71mm, Guitar Shoulder Strap and 6 Strings.4. GUITAR:- The guitar was glossy, no scratch, no dent, no damage. CHECKED from all angles and with flash and light. The guitar received with fully precised packing and handling.5. PRODUCT REVIEW:- The strings were not tuned which is a good thing, you can tune as per your convenience. After tuning it sounds good, the eco and vibrations are quite lovely.Feedback:- If you are a beginer and wants your hands on a good guitar in best budget, this is what you are looking for. Buy it I will say.

Not worth it at all... Please read the details mentioned in this review.


This product is not worthy enough to purchase. It's heavily coated with paint to hide the flaws, however after 3 days of keeping it in the same cardboard box in which it was delivered the paint which was already coming out a bit, started to come out a lot on its own revealind the actual material used, the neck of the guitar and most of the material is plastic, not wood. I took the guitar to a professional who confirmed it and clearly said that even the sound from this guitar is not accurate or even close to 'accurate'. I didn't play it yet, took it to get tuned, and it turns out that it cannot be tuned properly as well. The strings even after tightening are loosing their grip and as a result after a point it will break or come out as per what the professional told me. Its not worth at all.. it'd be better to move it and go to a shop and purchase it in person. This is not for either 'Beginners' or anyone.. WORST PRODUCT EVER ORDERED! AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK.. I saved money especially for a guitar and now i regret ordering it..

I am a guitar teacher and this guitar is a nightmare


4 of my students already purchased this guitar before coming to me for classes and there are lot of issues in this guitar. For starters, intonation is really bad (which means 'besura' notes in layman's language) The bridge will come out after few months because the quality is cheap. One student has already faced this issue. There is no 'truss rod' as well which means there is no way to adjust action. And there are many more issues which a non-musician won't understand. If you go on OLX, you'll find many of this same guitar lying there to be sold 2nd hand because after joining guitar class and showing it to their guitar teacher, students realize how horrible the guitar is. A humble request for beginners - please don't buy guitar BEFORE joining guitar class. Your guitar teacher doesn't deserve that kind of torture to their EARS! ü§£ Ask your teacher first, and then buy. Don't trust your own judgement. Just because something makes SOUND doesn't mean it's good to use. This is more like a toy, not a guitar. Don't trust the reviews here as well. Majority of these reviews are written by beginners who have bad or average music-sense! Also, kindly upvote this review (click on the helpful button so that it appears on top) I am fed up of seeing this guitar in my class. If I see one more of this guitar in my class I swear I'll go crazy! Click on the HELPFUL button. I want every damn beginner in the world to read this!

Good to hang in your bedroom, not to play.!


I've played a handful of guitars before. This is the worst I've ever touched with my hand.!It's no good even for beginners. The fretboard is so small so that you won't be able to play any chord without annoyed by the fingers touching other strings. The action is extremely high which will result in not just pain, 'injuries' in your fingertips.And the main problem I faced - the low e string is placed out of the fretboard so it cannot be played at all. Refer the picture.The sound quality is fine and comes in a cheap packaging. But considering the quality of the product inside - that's fine.If you are looking for a toy or decoration for your home, you can choose this.If you want to learn or play a guitar, spend a little more money and get a better one

Very bad. Please my comments. Never buy this guitar in your life. E string will break. So bad quality. Can't tune that string either. Did not get bag and accessories also first time.

1)Packaging delivery was all good,It's good for money.But not recommended.I read the same reviews but was on a tight budget and hurry.Hence made a mistake.2)Even for a beginner don't buy.Only preferred for children for FUN PURPOSES ONLY.3)Every 2 weeks you need to tighten the strings to get the std sound.And the more you tighten it more the handle will bend to front side as the wood will not be able to withstand the pressure.Which is not at all good.P.S.-If you really wanna learn join classes who provide their guitar for practice and then with some more bucks have something authentic afterwards.

It is good guitar for extreme beginners. The action is kind of very high and you can feel it while playing. But the sound it creates is nice at this price range but if you have a better budget, go for other brands and dreadnought size...in small size guitar without trust rod like this it is very difficult to adjust the action.

Action is way too high. Not for beginners. Not for anyone.


Action (distance between string and fret board) is way too highAction is even greater than the distance between two strings.There is no truss rod so you can't change the action.I had to sand down the string rests on both end but still action is way too high.Not at all for beginners as the strings are way too hard to press down, and beginner would think that is how hard guitar is. pressing down any string with pinky finger is next to impossible.

Good for casual use only.


This is my very first experience with a guitar. After using it for half a year, here's how I feel -Sound quality: I honestly didn't expect the guitar to sound this good. And it didn't, at first. But once I tuned it properly... Voila! It's rich, it's full, and one cannot possibly ask for more at this price! (Rating: 4.5/5)Build quality: The guitar's lightweight and doesn't feel very sturdy, however, apart from a few dents incurred due to accidental collisions with other objects, it's still in one piece. Being a budget offering, it doesn't have a truss rod, which makes the neck prone to bending, but I haven't had that happen to me yet. The strings are of low quality though and had begun to rust within the first fortnight itself. (Rating: 3.5/5)Comfort: This is one area where this guitar is absolute crap. Especially for a beginner. The action - or the distance between the strings and the fretboard - is a bit too much, making it that much harder for a newbie to master the art of playing a guitar. Even if you're determined enough to persist with it, there's no way you'll be able to play it for extended periods of time - without inflicting serious damage upon your fingers, that is. (Rating: 1.5/5)Final verdict: This is not meant for people who are serious about learning how to play a guitar. It's for those wanting to take a 'test drive' before committing fully to that idea. Or, if you're like me and just need a stress-buster (of the musical kind) to help you unwind after a long day at work - this guitar should suffice. It's nothing more, nothing less. (Overall rating: 3/5)

Reasons why you should not buy this guitar* Strings are of poor quality*The gap between board and strings is large.* It gives extra strain (pain) to your fingers in comparison with other guitars.*Sound Quality is not as good as you expect.*Build Quality is poor.Reasons why you Should buy this Guitar* It is very cheap.* I looks good.* You are beginner and have tight budget.* At this price it is best.I have used this guitar for around 1 year.

This guitar is just about okay. Price is high looking at the quality.


I purchased this two weeks back and it broke the string while I was tuning it. This would be my third guitar purchase but this one for my cousin to learn as a beginner and while it has not bad of a sound, It does feel pretty flimsy. It broke the E string on very first tuning. They do give extra set of strings but of course. Frets are subtle for beginners not to get their fingers busted by strings. Other than that, I don't see my cousin moving around a lot with it as carelessly as one should with their instrument. Feels like made of very thin wood.

If you are going to take your first lesson of Guitar then this is the best you can find


Best guitar to get started with. This is a bit small in size which is good for beginners as they can handle it better. Easy to play and sounds pleasing.Once you are good enough to play without looking at fretboard then good for better and bigger one.Made in china. Imported quality. Presentation is 5 star. You wont be disappointed.

¬†After some time the neck is going to bend and there is no truss rod to adjust. Due to this distance between strings and frets will increase. Would've given 5star if the product is included truss rod.

Best for Pre-beginners


I got excited about guitars after I saw a few guitar videos and tutorials. I was not sure if I can maintain my interest in learning and playing guitar. Hence without much investment, I was looking for an average quality guitar.This guitar does the job, although the quality is definitely at par with Yahama or Faith guitars. If you are a pre-beginner and wants to learn the basic strumming, fingering and chords, this guitar will do the job. Once you reach a beginner or intermediate level, you can go ahead with better quality guitars.You also get extra set of strings, 2 picks and an average quality bag.I broke A string on the very first day while trying to tune the guitar, hence extra set of string comes handy. Be careful with tuning.If someone is a pro and has used quality guitars, they might find this guitar below average. But for pre-beginners like me, it just does the job.I got this for 2200 but I have seen a few people buying it for 1900 to 2100 as well. If you are getting it under 2500, its a fair deal I guess. Also you can have a look at Intern guitars as well which are also for pre-beginners.Overall happy with the product.

This is not even a guitar, piece of junk.


I am playing guitar for 17 years and I haven't seen a Bad guitar like this one ever.  This is not even a real guitar. It is simply a toy. The fretboard is a joke. It was arrived neck broken, never mind.  The quality is awful too. It is very light, the neck was loosely attached and the wood was very bad,I need a refund, I don't want replacment.Simply don't buy it. Waste of money.Re. The situation becomes pathetic when the refund part comes, they simply avoided pickup telling verification failure and didn't also replaced the order.  Nuisance is going on here.

Think twice


I bought this guitar during lockdown oct 2019. It's kind of late as I'm writing this review (i have exams tommorow i don't know what Iam doing xD)So basically this guitar is a beginner guitar but in my opinion a beginner should not have any kind of Barrier blocking them to become a good guitarist and i think this guitar kind of makes the journey less fun, why? Because the sound quality is really very poor it also only has 18 frets, acoustic guitars have 20. It shouldn't really make a difference since you wouldn't be playing that high when first starting out until you reach 1-2 years.TLDR: try to push your budget a bit more and consider buying a dreadnought guitar. Iam altho very grateful for having this as my first Guitar, it taught me how to maintain my guitar.

Not worth your money


People would think that it‚Äôs a steal at just Rs. 5000 but in reality they just steal your money. This thing is just a piece of wood with strings. 3 of them broke when I was tuning it for the first time, and it never sounded accurate.You can call it a beginners guitar if you don‚Äôt really care about the perfect sound and just want to get comfortable strumming and learning new notes.

Good guitar for 2000rs.


I was using this guitar for more than 6 months and I didn't found any problem for beginners.Yes it has some mistakes while making the guitar such as high distance between the fretboard and strings, dots on the guitar, total number of frets, hardness of strings, scratches on the body, small dent on body etc. But what you can expect to get in 2000rs.Still It is good for beginners who have small budget for learning the guitar. You can purchase this guitar for learning the basics and can use it for maximum 4 to 5 months and then move on for Yamaha, Cort or Fender guitars.

For 2500, this is a great guitar, sounds just nice


The first one that arrived - the neck was completely broken in to two. So before you receive the package, check package integrity. Mine was looking ok, but still I can see a dent marks in the neck area where the guitar was broken.Amazon picked my broken guitar and immediately replaced it with the new one in no time.When they picked the old one, I was looking for the Neck Band, Extra Strings and Strummer. They were not found. But then only when I got the new guitar I realised they were inside the guitar bag's side pocket. The moment I opened the cardboard box, I knew the neck was broken before I can take the guitar out of the box - just via the transparent polythene package.So thanks to Amazon for replacing it quickly, but at the same time, caution to those who are ordering this guitar to just pay attention to the package detail and inform the delivery person in advance. I don't think we can do nothing else but just give an attempt for replacing the guitar.

Not even for beginners.


This product is inconsistency in action. If two people buy this same guitar they can get different action that too with huge difference. The first time i got this action was 5mm for 1st string and that is too high to begin with. I went for replacement and the product i got for replacement had 6mm action. So I would suggest not to waste yout money on these kinds of guitar. Even if you are a beginner and if you can spend 2-3K extra then plz buy a good guitar in 5K segment. This I would not suggest to anyone. As the action is high you will face a lot of difficulty in pressing the strings.

Hi guys,This guitar is not a bad guitarOnly if you feel like you wanna experiment with playing guitarBut I do not recommend it if you're extremely serious about taking up guitar.There are amazing guitar s if you increase your price range a bit (maybe 4000 rupees). Because this guitar only has 19 frets and is extremely hard to okay because of high action. The tuning legs are of low quality and sound quality is average at bestPlease think about buying guitar s from bands like kaps, kadence or even Yamaha (the f310 is an amazing choice for everyone)Hope I was helpful.

I was searching for a good guitar and I found this one. The reviews were good. But the wasn't too good. It's just average. This is my detailed review.ProsIt is very cheap.Good colour and attractive bodyConsI have seen many reviews saying that it is good for beginners. But it is not. It's action is very high and it will be difficult to play this . For those who don't know what action is it is the distance between strings and fret. It is very high which makes it difficult to play.Also it is getting out of tune very frequently.If you can buy a better one please do.If this your only choice then it's up to you

Unplayable - Action is too high!


Do not buy this product, even if you're an absolute beginner!I received this guitar yesterday and immediately learnt that the guitar action is too high. For those who don't know what guitar action is: it is the distance between a string and the fretboard of the guitar. While guitars are meant to have 0.2-0.25 mm of action ideally, the one I received had it as 0.5mm, making it unplayable. As a beginner you may not notice this right away, but playing anything on this guitar will be impossible for you and you'll wonder if something is wrong with you.I have ordered a replacement from Amazon, will update my review based on the replacement guitar.PS: you cannot adjust this without taking it to a shop, which will cost you a lot. It's better to just add a bit to your budget and get a better, playable guitar at 6-7k.

Will recommend beginners to buy this... Headstart in the right direction!


Good quality guitar... However the string quality isn't very durable .. the first string broke on tuning and when replaced by the extra set of strings ...It broke again... Had to buy from a music store... However... My guitar ""sir"" did say that the quality of the guitar was good except that there is a certain level of buzzing that the strings produced in initially... It did fade away with time.... and especially since it came with guitar case and picks etc... It is value for money. Only my first string has broken... The others are still intact... So hence giving 4 stars for this product... I would recommend it to beginners to buy it. Have been using it for more than a month now

Good product to learn. But packaging is Bad


The first guitar which I received had crack on its neck. As soon as I started tuning it the crack got widened up. So I asked for an exchange. Within 2 days I got exchange product which has a dent and small crack on the bottom part. I asked for exchange but they refused saying an order can be replaced only once. They are ok to give me a full refund by returning guitar. But I'm not sure I'll get an guitar with an offer price of 1700 in future. So I'm ok with it since damage is minimal and does not affect the tuning.Sound quality is goodStrings are not good. Better to change it with good grade strings.Product packaging and making is not all upto the mark. Guitar has cracks or damage in any one of the place.Overall a good guitar for a beginner untill he learns to play in a short period of time

OK for a casual use.


For someone who wants to seriously learn, may be you can spend a bit more.My main problem with this is that the Fret to String distance(Action) is too much!The frets are almost flat to the board and hence you need to press hard.Its difficult to play Barre chords due to the requirement of pressing the string too hard.

First off, this is an insanely cheap product. So keep that in mind. The fretboard is completely flat so it's really hard to play bar chords.The sound quality is okay at best. The steel strings are really poor and both pairs snapped very quickly for me. But that was okay since a good set will only cost you ‚Çπ350.

The Action is very high. It's way higher than ordinary high. The Action is the gap between the strings and the base board. A professional guitarist will not be able to play the guitar having action this high. It will hurt your fingers. So if you are a beginner then please check the action. If it's too high then replace it. I opted for replacement but i don't know if they will send the guitar with same action.

Not a good guitar to buy.


Not at all good for a beginning. Trust me I wanted to learn guitar and bought this just looking at the best seller sign. But don't fall into that trap.It's distancing b/w the frets is wrong and the distance b/w the fret and the string is too big, causing more pain to the fingers...

Don't buy it


Please don't buy this guitar . After watching all reviews you will definitely think to buy it but Please don't go for it . Sound is ok But the most important it doesn't have truss rod . Means this guitar doesn't have it . So eventually this  guitar's neck will start to bend and you can't do anything . It will unplayable . I do big mistake to buy . Don't go on look . It's look is perfect but future of guitar is not good

A guitar for kids to play around


At a price of 1.9 k it's good for wannabes.The sound quality is average.The build is good for the price it is offered.The action (distance between strings and fret board is very high). Have to press really hard to get proper soundThe Allen keys option is not there. But at this price it's a waste to think about it.String quality is ok.In my view it's good for kids who are just beginning to learn guitar.

Perfect for kids upto age 10 and definitely not for beginners


Perfect for kids who are very much interested about the guitar and want to learn it as it is compact but for beginners I'd say not worth the shot. For beginners I'd suggest to spend around 5k or so and order it from Bajaao.com as they deliver the product with utmost care and the products are flawless. Best for people who wants to buy a guitar but unable to visit a store.

Not good if you are serious in guitar learning.


It's small guitar and sounds are not too good. Buy only if you want this for a child of less than 12years. Else invest in good guitar of yahma which Is more durable and sounds proffesional. It's not that good. But sitghting its price it's good only for children's who just want to have one but not for serious music lovers.

Should not be bought by anyone who wants to seriously learn guitar.


I had left my fender in US and bought this while I was in India for 2 weeks. Thought a cheap one would be ok. Was wrong. Terrible sound quality and not easy to play. If you want to learn guitar, spend the money and get a better one. Trying to learn on this is going to be demotivating.

Best beginners guitar


After using it for more  then 8 months its a great guitar for the price lot of people saying its only useful in the first 6months of learning but you can use it as long as you want cuz i learned open chords and bar chords finger picking on it its great for fingerstyle and finger picking the high action makes it little difficult for finger pressing but you will used to it the sound is great for the price you can use it for years

Below promised expectations.


Action is too high as opposed to what has been described. Too thick strings that are difficult to play towards higher frets.  But it puts out huge sound/sustain. Overall , not a good value for money as promised (1500 vs 6000).Suggestions:Check the action/playability before despatch. It would up the value of your guitar.

The sound quality is much better at price,you can also tighten the 5th and 6th string a little more to make it sound even better,but remember do not tighten the 1st(thinnest) string to much as it easily breaks. Even if the string breaks do not worry you can purchase more strings individually ora full set. The product has very high action,fingers hurt,but you have to bear the pain and become strong to learn it.

Bad quality; not recommended.


Returning the product. When tuning, the bridge is coming out of the guitar. Looks like a refurbished product. Not recommend at ll. High action is needed to get proper notes. Strings are so hard, so it will be highly painful for fingers. This would give a bad impression to beginner guitarists.

Don't buy this guitar. This is just a toy.


I'm a beginner and I thought I would not need high priced guitars for just practising beginner lessons and other basic stuff. When I got the guitar, I was surprised. The guitar had a good tone. I learnt a lot of basic stuff with this guitar. But the strings are low quality and the action is very high (the advertisement is false - almost 6mm at 12th fret and 3mm at first fret). You'll hurt your fingers if you play for more than an hour and you can't barre the strings completely because of high action. Even the fret heights are uneven. So, my advice is that you go for branded guitars like Yamaha(you'll get a good budget acoustic guitar around 8k). Please don't buy this one. You can't make any good progress with this crap.

Great Product!


I am new to musical instruments. I wanted to start with a pretty cool instrument and so I chose guitar. As I didn't know a lot about guitars I chose to experiment with a guitar starting with a comparatively low price. And when taking that into consideration, I think this guitar would be a good choice to go with.

This is one of the cheapest guitars out there and it was my first so I didn't know how bad it was until I tried my cousin's 15k acoustic Yamaha guitar. So I guess if you just wanna try learning the guitar or something it's a good choice. And also you know the saying, ""blame the engineer not the tools"". lel

If you are a first time buyer! Go for it!!!


If you are a beginner, this is an amazing guitar. Wondering why?? It takes time for you to know your guitar. You start learning -  how hard you have to press the strings, there are many scenarios where you just break the string unknowingly now, if you have have purchased a good one, it will cost you too much to change the strings etc.

Worth it for 2k!


This guitar is small, for beginners it is perfect. You can learn on this and then upgrade your guitar. This doesn't have truss rod. Sound is average. The guitar detunes frequently so you have to tune it every other day. The wood which Is used to make this guitar is very light weight and of cheap quality but what can you expect at this price range. I would give it 6/10 overall. But for ‚Çπ2200, it is worth it!

Bad packaging, bad quality bag.


Hi, I got the product now, but the packaging was veryy disappointing, and moreover, the guitar bag that I received is such a bad quality, that just got holes and the chain of the brand new bag didn't even work. The tunes weren't set which I feel wouldn't be. Overall I am not happy with the packaging. The guitar looked beautiful though.

Quality is not good.It started breaking from back of it's fret board only when left tuned for a SINGLE NIGHT (see the pinned pic)NO TRUSS ROD, which is also lead to negative marking for durability.I'll not recommend you to buy. You can spend a little more money to buy better GUITAR.

The best for beginners


The guitar is best if you are a newbie and are just fiddling with the idea of guitarAs it's very inexpensive you can get it in 1600 to 2000  which it is worth it

Fret gaps are more!


It is a great product for the bigginners but keep in mind that it's frets are a lit more far away from the strings which could result in finger pain when using for long time and also it has only 18 frets.

This guitar is good for beginners.But it is not lasting and the sound quality is very low.So, overall a good product for beginners only.Easy to handle.

Most of the reviews here are misleading. The guitar isn't very good for beginners. The action is very high and you have to press the strings real hard to get the proper sound. This makes chord transitions a nightmare when you play the songs. Also my b string broke within a month. Won't recommend it.

I got this pretty thing delivered yesterday and it's so good. Since I'm a beginner and I'm very petite I find this guitar easy to handle because it doesn't weigh too much and is not too big. I highly recommend this guitar to those who want to avoid a painful shoulder or arm. It is a good pick for kids also.

It is quite light and easy to play for beginners but the strings are too fragile and might break easily. Guitarists who've been playing for years this might not be an ideal choice,for beginners it's okay as slides are a lot easier in this.

Value for money


The Guitar is good for learning but,for adult it is small. The gap between strings is law so fingers doesn't feet with it. By the way for adult girls and kids about 15 years it is value for money. Good looking good sound and build quality.
