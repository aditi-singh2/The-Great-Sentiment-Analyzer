Great for first time retinol users üòç


This is a lovely light cream with retinol. Perfect for people who have not used retinol before. I started using this 6 weeks ago as Susan Yara spoke about this in one of her YouTube videos. I have never had a reaction to this lovely cream ... it has taken me 6 weeks to get to the stage where I am now and apply it on my face every night. I have seen a difference as have other people. My fine lines around my eyes and neck appear to have been smoothed out and my dark spots on my cheeks are not as noticeable as they were 6 weeks ago. I am delighted with this product ... it‚Äôs a fantastic cream to start on if you‚Äôve never used retinol before. I can not recommend this highly enough ...

Good cream but i don't see the difference


I got this cream because of the reviews, but to be honest, after using it for more than a month I do not see any differences in my skin. No improvement. So, for the price, I do feel a bit ripped off . The consistency of the cream, is like any other, it has no smell and it is easy to apply. However, i have not seen any improvement at all in my skin. Wish I could say the opposite.

I have very sensitive skin and after good reviews I thought of giving it a go. Although it is meant for every day use I can only use it every few days or so in very small amounts because it causes my skin to break out.

Good value moisturiser even for sensitive areas


The creaminess of this retinol moisturiser is just right with no shine once absorbed & doesn't stay on the skin in claggy patches. Even use it around eyes with no side effects. Has made some wrinkles less noticeable & some disappeared altogether - like the large vertical crevasse under one of my eyebrows. Unfortunately, doesn't close my 60+ year old open pores, but not meant for that. Have bought it 4 times now

AMAZING product.  Incredible value.  Beats my $75 serum!!


I wished there was a way to give this product 10 stars.Let me first say I'm a VERY picky retinol user.  I usually use a high end organic product (aka: Origins) but thought I'd give this one a whirl given the reviews.  I'm a tried and proven convert now.  I LOVE this product.  It is so luxurious, never causes burning, peeling or redness.  Truthfully, I think this is best retinol cream I've ever used and that's just how it FEELS on my skin.  Let's talk results.Usually most ads state something like ""95% of users noticed improvement with wrinkles in 7 days"" or something along that line.  I often have wondered, who are the respondents to those trials?  Have they ever used ANY product before?  (Many women consistently don't even use a face cream yet or have an established habit of moisturizing their skin.)  If not, of course they'd see incredible results!  I've been taking care of my skin with a normal regimen since my teens.  (Thanks Mom!)  That said, my skin is pretty acclimated at this point to moisturizers and anti-wrinkle creams.  In short, it's hard to dramatically improve beyond what I currently use, which are stellar (but pricey) products.This product changed the playing field.  With one use, I could tell this was different.  I'm addicted now and have a hard time finishing up my other products!  People at work ask me what I'm doing to my skin.  They tell me how super soft, supple and radiant my skin looks.  I thought it was just me that noticed but others have too.  I don't want to waste any other existing product so I'm going to still use that up first before ordering more, but once it's gone, I'll be ordering this full time from now on.  I'm also going to try out their other products as well.

Loyal to this product/brand


I'm 55 yrs old.  I've been using this product for about 6 months.  I bought it because I was tired of paying over $100 for department store products and I figured it couldn't hurt to try something new.  All I can say is that my skin looks great.  It's tight, it's clear, and it has a healthy glow.  I'm attaching a photo I took a couple of weeks ago (keep in mind that I'm 55 so my skin isn't perfect) but I think it looks pretty good.  I also love the fact that I don't have to be stingy with it due to it's affordability; I use it on my face and neck twice a day.  I also use Lilyana Natural Rosehip and Hibiscus Eye Cream, for the record. I've had no cosmetic surgery on my face, which I'm sure you can tell, but overall I think I look pretty good!  The product is gentle and pure, so I've not experienced any ill effects with it.  I hope this review helps you to feel comfortable with purchasing this great, affordable product.

The Holy Grail Retinol


I love this product! I had been looking to get into a retinol for a while, I did a lot of research and tried a few different ones to ease my skin into it. As anyone who knows retinol would know, it can be quite aggressive for first time users. So I decided to give this one a try after I saw a dermatologist review it. I have had no luck with other retinols even after months of slowly working up to using them regularly my skin just would not take to them and the pimples continued and my skin looked worse then when I started.So I bought this one, I have been using for 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I worked up slowly again to using it daily just in case it caused my skin to flake or purge. But I had none of those issues with this. My skin never peeled and I had the odd purging pimple at the start but that was it. It has completely transformed my skin, it looks ""airbrushed"" almost. It has a kind of blurring affect, it makes my skin tone so even and I have no texture at all. I hardly ever get pimples now and if I do get the odd one, I put this on over night and it completely vanishes the next morning. I have also noticed is diminishes fine lines, scaring and any sun damage it seems to help with everything.I now use it as part of my night time routine, before moisturiser I pump out about the size of a bean and rub it into my hands then smear it all over my face and neck. It feels so luxurious going on, it glides around so nicely and just feels great. I could rub it in all day. I then pat down any excess and let it soak in. It leaves my skin looking nice and dewy afterwards as well. There is no scent, that's why I gave it no stars for scent, but I think that makes it perfect for people who are sensitive to fragrances in products.In terms of value, it's definitely not the cheapest retinol but it's also not the most expensive. The bottle seems to give you plenty of product and you don't need much to cover your whole face/neck so I think it will last me a while. And for the ingredients as well, it's really hard to find a retinol that has nearly the same strength as prescription retinol with hydrating and calming ingredients like Hydroluronic Acid. So I really think its a win win.I am definitely going to be re-purchasing this again. I am sold. I'd recommended it to everyone! So definitely give it a try!

After 6 weeks stopped irritating my skin and is now fabulous!


I have sensitive combination skin, I have bad reactions to EVERYTHING. The last retinol serum I used had be come out in a rash, I decided to give this a go;It is a cream texture so using as a night cream and at first again broke out in pimples which I was very said about but I changed using it to only once a week to build up resilience. Now I can use it every other day and it‚Äôs great- no irritation or skin issues. I only use on my forehead around my crows feet and neck because I fear using cream products on my chin causes me to break out But I will keep going and update when I finally am brave to try the rest of my face!

You can use apple cider vinegar before applying.


My skin is very oily and acne prone. I applied the retinol cream day and night with nothing else but it did not do anything for me. It's only later when I decided to wash my face with apple cider vinegar and then put on the cream that I noticed a difference. It helps, some days a lot, but I need to be patient with it.The concentration of this cream is excellent, so a little goes a long way. Don't use too much and you will save up as well.

Not sure if got the genuine product


Was really excited to try this product after seeing almost 30k reviews on Amazon and some more youtube reviews of this retinol cream. Have been using it for past 6 months and really don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a retinol product. Being a first time user of retinol product I was expecting my skin to be dried out a bit as this one claims to have high percentage of retinol. But have not felt any irritation on my skin. Seems like a normal moisturizer. 3 star as is has not done any harm to my skin as well. Highly doubt if I got the genuine product.

Pleasant to use, just not miraculous


I didn't notice any effect on my fine lines, but it was lovely to apply. I wish there was a window on the container, though; because it's an opaque pump bottle, I didn't know I needed to order more until I was completely out.It's a nice cream. I'd get it again.

Not a fan!


Based on the reviews, I was so excited. An all natural moisturizer that many has stated worked wonders! But for me it was a no, i have combination skin and have tried brand name to drug store moisturizers. Think la mer to neutrogina. I wanted to try a more natural route. Day one: felt great! Moisturized without oilDay 2: slight tingle and rednessDay 3: decided to alternate and use cetaphil to give my skin a break. Used cream only in the amDay 4: redness under both eyes and so ITCHY!!!Day 6 red swollen dry patches that are itchy!Day 8: patches are bigger and more irritatedI have never reacted this way to a moisturizer and while the photos dont show the swelling or both eyes, it does show the worsening in the redness. one picture is from day 4 then day 6. I will not continue to use this past a week.

Pay attention to ingredients!


While I truly loved this product the texture of the cream, how hydrating it was and the way my skin texture improved, I had to stop using it and find a better source of retinol. This product contains Phenoxyethanol which is used in place of parabens but can be harmful to The body long term and has been banned in Europe and Japan, but unfortunately not the US. It is especially harmful to infants nervous systems so having a baby opened up my eyes and made me stop using this product. Just do your homework and be careful when you see anything labeled natural!

I began my new skin care regimen on Jan 28th. I pieced together what seemed to be working for me from a few different lines of products. I follow the same routine morning and night (with a few exceptions where I was up extremely late and slept in my makeup) and I am very happy with my results! I wash my face using Olay Regenerist wash, then use a micro needle roller. I then use Acure brand Toner. After that fully absorbs, I use the Lily Ana Vitamin C Serum and the Lily Ana Retinol Cream. Then depending on morning or evening, I use either Acure morning or night moisturizer. I'm absolutely in love with the results that the Lily Ana products have helped me to achieve in two months! I highly recommend incorporating their products into your daily regimen!First photo is Jan 28th, second is April 6th. Both were taken immediately after washing my face.

WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE FORMULA????


Look at pic, left old formula (love), right new formula (hate). New formula does not agree with my skin at all, please change it back! You moved the ingredient (Phenoxyethanol) that is not good for skin from second to last, now it is ahead of the retinol and hylalorinic acid. New bottle does not say the % of organic nor does it say the % of retinol. I am so sad about the change, I really, really liked the old formula. Will be returning this. Looks as though you changed the vitamin C formula too. I will be finding a new product to love.

Amazing! I had a smile wrinkle building on the side of my mouth and this definitely has been helping to lessen the definition of the wrinkle. And it is not heavy and soaks in the skin fairly quickly without any greasy feel to your skin (actually it leaves it really soft after). I have an anti aging cream that cost triple this cost...they do an equal job, maybe this productions is even better, and this is much lighter feel on my skin and doesn't cause me to break out when I use it consistently like the anti aging cream!The picture is after using it for a week can consistently.

Several weeks later and now a face full of acne


I am 56 years-old.  I bought this product because I was tired of paying $75 and up for skin care products at department and cosmetic stores.  I have been using this retinol cream for two weeks now and absolutely love it!  The cream has softened, smoothed, lifted, and firmed my skin and has made it more radiant.  It is even eliminating clogged pores and reducing some milia I have.  It is the best skin care product I have ever used, and that's significant because I have tried almost everything over the years.  The price point for this product is incredible, as well.  I am going to order another bottle of this retinol cream today so that I have one on hand when the first bottle runs out.  Because I was so impressed with this product, I ordered the three other products by LilyAna Naturals that are offered on Amazon -- the eye cream, the vitamin C serum, and the moisturizer.  And I am equally impressed with these products!  Throw in the fact that I paid less for all four products than what I previously paid for just one product at a department store,  and you have a completely devoted LilyAna Naturals customer.Update:I should have known better than to post a review of a skin care product so soon after receiving it. After I finished my first bottle of the retinol moisturizer, I ordered a second one. I thought the second one smelled a little odd when I opened it, but I wasn't certain. Anyway, here I am a few weeks later with a face full of acne, some of it cystic. It has to be either this product and/or the Lilyana Naturals vitamin c serum I started using at the same time I started using the retinol cream.  I haven't had a breakout like this since I was a teenager, but it is just as upsetting and frustrating now as it was then, even more so because you kind of expect it when you're a teenager, but not when you're in your 50's. It can only be the Lilyana Naturals products that are causing this reaction because the the only other things I use on my face are the same cleanser and foundation that I've used for years. At this point all I can do is stop using all skin care products until the acne clears, and then I will have to go back to the department store products I was using before. I even stocked up on the retinol cream and the vitamin c serum because I was initially so excited about the results that I was getting. But now I'm too scared to use any of it, so it will all end up going to waste.  I should have known that if it sounds too good to be true, it is, and you get what you pay for.

Inconsistent and disappointing


This is the second time I‚Äôve purchased this cream. The first time I really liked it. I have sensitive skin and it didn‚Äôt cause any irritations, burning or itching. It didn‚Äôt have a smell and I felt that it gave my skin a good amount of moisture without being oily. However, after receiving my second bottle I found the product to be extremely inconsistent with my first experience. The product itself is gritty (as you can see in the picture provided) and has a strong fragrance. I only put it on my face once before I had noticed the odd texture and it bothered my skin almost instantly. I‚Äôm very disappointed  with the inconsistency.

Horrible product! Put this retinol cream on at night and woke up with a horrible breakout of small red bumps all over my face.

Love love love LilyAna products


Ok, long post. I truly love LilyAna products! This is my first time using the retinol cream, but this is my 2nd time ordering the Vit C serum.I‚Äôm 37 and have had acne since middle school. I‚Äôve been using over the counter acne meds for a few years and while they did help with the large and deep pimples, I was still breaking out in small pimples (esp before my period) but I also have very large pores courtesy of my mother, and so I get blackheads very easily. I finally decided to start treating my skin like an adult and not a prepubescent teen ü§£. I stopped the acne meds and decided to try products that would regulate my natural oils and hopefully help with evening out my skin tone. So I found these products and I‚Äôm hooked. Being a vegetarian I also love that they are natural, mostly organic, and cruelty free. So every night I use the retinol cream. It is super rich and moisturizing. I read that it can make you flake a little bit and yes it did happen around 7 days into it, but it was over in about 2 days. I also use this coffee bean caffeine eye cream that I‚Äôm loving (from amazon). In the morning I use the eye cream again, the LilyAna Vit C serum, and then a hydrating facial serum ontop of it (I got that from my mom and I believe she got it at Costco but not certain). Once it‚Äôs all soaked in I top off with sunscreen. I also use both serums on my upper chest, as I‚Äôm noticing some sun spots lately. Every other night I wash my face with an electric brush. I don‚Äôt use it every night bc I don‚Äôt want to totally irritate my skin. I‚Äôve been doing this routine for about 2 weeks and I‚Äôve noticed such a difference already!  No major pimples, fewer blackheads especially on my chin, and I‚Äôve noticed that my eyes aren‚Äôt as dark, so my skin looks much more even. I used the Vit C before and really noticed how it helped with sunspots on my forehead. Also, their customer service is spot on. Try them!

I have taken terrible care of my skin my entire life. I've never had a skin care routine. I've always just washed my face with soap, never moisturized, spent a good chunk of my younger years never using sunscreen and now only use it if I'm at the pool/beach. And, I've mostly gotten away with it until recently. But, with a lot of weight loss comes a lot of wrinkles. In my case, the wrinkles around my eyes were most problematic.So, I did a little research and learned that I needed to look for products with retinoids, vitamin c and hyaluronic acid to help with my wrinkles.After some more research, I found a product line called LilyAna Naturals. They have a retinol cream and a Vitamin C serum that are very highly rated on Amazon. They've also gotten a bunch of other great reviews from other places. And their prices are much lower than other products with the same ingredients. I decided to give them a shot AND take before and after pics to see if they did what they were supposed to.It's been 2 and a half months since I started using this stuff. The pics don't lie. There's no filter on any of them and they were taken in the same spot under the same lighting. I'm amazed. Not only is this stuff effective, it doesn't irritate my eyelids which have become super sensitive in the past few years.I'm not getting paid or being given any free product to share this. I'm just excited that this stuff actually works.

Ok so there is no miracle cream that will erase all your lines and wrinkles but this sure does help! I've been a religious user of Olay's regenerist since its advertised to be ""comparable to the the $400 creams"".  However I saw this product and it had great reviews and was slightly cheaper so I thought I'd give it a try.  So far the deep lines in my forehead have noticeably diminished and the overall texture of my skin is improved.  I'm 41 and have always had large pores and more recently the appearance of my skin was almost gritty looking like sandpaper.  This product has reduced the appearance of my pores, smoothed my face and completely fixed the  weird crepey pouch of skin on my neck!  I'm very pleased with the results and will definitely buy this again.  I'm now looking into their other products.

Ingredients recently changed, now includes pentylene glycol‚Äîwhich really can't be called ""natural""


Loved this product a lot. Recommended it to friends. Then I go on here to reorder and I see that they've changed the ingredients. Pentylene Glycol is a (usually) petro-chemical based solvent and humectant that can cause dermatitis in many, including myself. :( It probably helps preserve the product for longer...but at what cost? :P Retinol is now further down on the ingredients list as well.Calling this ""natural"" at this point is really arguable.My friend shipped hers back and I won't order this again. :(

great product


I have been using this product for a little over a month now and my skin seems to really like it. It has evened out my skin tone and moisturizes very well. I have noticed that the skin under my eyes is less thin/crepey and I attribute that to this product. I only use it at night and use Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery with SPF 50 in the mornings. Very pleased with the results as my skin is very soft and just looks better, with makeup or without. I will definitely repurchase once this bottle runs out. Also, this is not a fake review, I am a real person who relies on reviews when looking to purchase items. Hopefully this helps others make a decision to purchase or not.

One-way ticket to Break Out


I've read about the trials of retinol, and was hoping this would be a low-stress option. The cream applied greasy and burned after application -- and I broke out horribly the next day. I was suggested to use it intermittently to allow my skin time to adjust, but I've continued to break out Every Time I use it. What a bummer!

Perfect for anyone of any age, great for people struggling with acne and acne scarring!


This is the first time I've ever taken the time to write an Amazon review, and it's for good reason. This stuff is AMAZING! I am 19 y/o and have always struggled with acne. I feel the need to always use foundation to cover up the dark spots and scars on my face because it's so bad and embarrassing to me. I also do a sport where I come into contact with a lot of outside stuff on my face, so it's really difficult for me to keep up a consistent skin care routine. I saw this stuff and on a whim asked my BF for it for Christmas. I started using it after I got it (5 days ago) and am already seeing amazing results. I use it once in the morning and once at night like suggested, and my skin is already looking improved. It healed some of the acne scars on my cheeks and has taken off a lot of the whiteheads. It's also making my face look more radiant and clean. I totally recommend this to anyone of any age who has or is struggling with acne and acne scarring. Granted, my scaring isn't that bad, but I notice it and the fact it is healing up makes me so happy. I love this stuff.

Really got rid of my actinic keratosis spot!


So I got this stuff back at the end of August and used it each night.  It wasn't making a difference and I got frustrated and gave up.  A few weeks ago, beginning of December, my dark patch, which is actinic keratosis, was getting rougher and was much more raised.  I could actually see it on my cheek if I looked down.  I decided to give the retinol another chance before the end of the year as I was planning on going to the doctor to get it removed in 2019.  Instead of putting a nice thin layer all over my face and rubbing it in I just put a small glop directly on the patch.  About a week and a half later it had softened so much I couldn't see it when I looked down any longer.  About a week after that the discoloration was gone.  I was, and still am stunned.  The first picture was taken August 29th 2018 and the second picture I just took now, January 7th, 2019.  The retinol cream, and less sun exposure, are the only things I've done differently but the results speak for themselves.  I've got a couple tiny spots on my other cheek.  I'm going to try working on them next.

Acne & Hyperpigmentation


I really enjoy this cream. I have acne prone skin and was having a bad flare up for several months. It left me with a lot of hyperpigmentation and I wanted to switch my products to target this problem. I decided on this and their vitamin C serum since both have key ingredients to help that. First few weeks my acne got worse. I figured it was probably the retinol and I looked that up. Because retinol increases the cell turnover rate any acne that was forming will surface quickly as the skin ""purges."" So I just kept using it and made sure I was exfoliating regularly to help the process. My acne has dramatically improved since then. I am no longer in a flare up. My skin has less dry patches and the hyperpigmentation is lifting quickly. I use day and night with an added sunscreen in the morning. This will be a regular in my skin routine.My only complaints are:-The packaging. Because I have to order this online I wish I could better tell when I was running out. I love that I can pump out only what I need and it stays sanitary but not knowing when I need to repurchase is a bummer.-I wish it smelled nicer. This is really just a personal preference. The product boasts not having any added fragrance which is a good thing because it can cause reactions on certain skin types. I just wish it smelled a little more spa like, but that's just me. It's not a deal breaker.

Retinol..where???


I purchased this on Feb. 5th.I just used the last pump of this yesterday 3/29/2018.I loved the feel of this product on my face and it really worked well with my make up as far as did not get oily or greasy but thats as far as it goes. After a month of using this , I have seen no noticeable difference in the tone of my skin, nor the texture. Pores are still defined and laugh lines are still noticeable and the blotchiness is still the same.I question the amount of retinol in this product because you feel no tingling or redness that is a tell tale sign of retinol once applied. I really am disappointed. I did notice more pimples popping up on my skin especially on my jawline and cheeks.I dont want to leave a terrible review because i feel like as a facial moisturizer its really nice but as a retinol treatment...it doesnt make the mark at all.

Not for me


I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. I did start to see an improvement in uneven skin tone, and I started to see an increase of breakouts after a couple of days but that is to be expected. About 3 days ago I developed a subdermal cyst (a single occurrence of cystic acne) as large as a silver dollar to the right side of my chin that makes me look like I got punched. I'm not sure why this happened, but I haven't used any other products on my face (I don't wear makeup either) so I have to decide that it was this product.

I bought this product hoping that it would be as great as some of the reviews that I read, however this was not the case.

excellent stuff!


This is a very good retinol cream. I have repurchased this product, and will continue to do so.Let me tell you about me - I am 47, white skin with a normal complexion for my age. I spent most of my youth and young adulthood tanning with reckless regard to the future. As a result - some sun damage, loss of elasticity, wrinkles are appearing (eyes, around mouth), skin on my neck is beginning to show signs of sag (whoa is that!). My pores are not fine, but i'd prefer if they were less noticeable!I started to use drug store retinols in december 2016. I applied them nightly. Some gave me that retinol irritation that left me feeling boiled. I bought this product in early march 2017.Upon ordering, I received a very kind email from the company thanking me for my purchase. I returned their greeting, and they responded back immediately. These are real people, and very nice ones too!The cream is packaged in a handy pump bottle. One pump of the cream is enough to generously cover my face, neck, and hands. I live in Maine which has been very dark and cloudy throughout the spring so I applied morning and night. It is not recommended to apply retinol during the day as the sun breaks it down, and can make your skin super sensitive to sunlight, but I thought - not sunny today, i'm putting it on!  I experienced no irritation with this product. I do experience a glowing complexion, wrinkles have softened considerably, and my skin is more firm. I love this product. I am complimented on my skin now! People are very surprised when they hear I am 47 - I am getting 35 (i'll take it!). I highly recommend this product. Very gentle, and effective.

Recieved 2 Bad Products


out of the 3 times I have received this product, only one had not been expired out-of-box. The first time I sent it back and received a new one and it was fine. The product seems to work well. I purchased it a second time assuming the first one was just a one-time mistake, and disappointingly it was also bad. You will know when you get a bad batch because it will smell kind of like a mix of fish and garlic. it's really gross. I didn't even bother returning the product a second time, I'm just going to move on to something new.

Buyer beware! Change in ingredients!


I thought the first bottle of this cream was pretty good. I didn't see a huge improvement in my skin but there was some improvement in my skin elasticity etc so I was happy to subscribe. However, when I got my second bottle I felt duped! The first bottle had primarily organic ingredients but the second bottle had none! I had noticed the first bottle looked slightly different, (see pic of opened bottle) than the second (pic with plastic still on it). The first didn't say ""high potency hyaluronic blend"" like the second one did. So, I decided to look at the ingredients and that's when I noticed the big change in ingredients. I think they changed their product. I'm so disappointed and it's too late to return. Buyer beware!

Firstly it is a smooth cream that is easy to apply and not oily


I have quite a bit to say about this product.  Firstly it is a smooth cream that is easy to apply and not oily.  It only takes a small amount and leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky.  I am in my 60's so don't expect anything to take away wrinkles but I do think my face is smoother and feels nourished.  It has lasted me a month now (I wanted to make sure it lasted at least that long) and is still going.  I did order another so I wouldn't be out suddenly and the day after I ordered it, someone from the company wrote me personally to thank me.  It must be a new company starting out because never never have I had that kind of customer service.  I hope they don't raise the price any time soon because it is better than the 60 dollar products I have had - have not spent over that ever.  So I have found my forever face  moisturizer and that is something pretty special to me.

Outstanding product, banishes milia!


Update after almost 3 years of using: medication has made my rosacea worse so I can't use it daily on the Stupid Rosacea Zones, but I can & do still use it daily on the rest of my face, plus I can use it weekly on the SRZ if they're not already flaring. Still a huge WIN for my skincare, at a terrific price!----------I tried this thinking it wouldn't live up to the hype, but turns out it ain't hype, it's the truth. This product has had the largest single impact of any of the many facial products I've tried on my 60-yr-old skin & that's about 45 years of different products. Within days of beginning the retinol my skin looked younger, more radiant and, astonishingly, it doesn't cause my (mild) rosacea to flare up, at all. That's a first for retinol products for me. (Now, 5 months later, it's STILL impressing me - the most impressive skincare product I've EVER used!)As I've aged my skin has thickened and I've had real problems with milia. I thought I'd just have to live with it, but after the fifth (yes 5th, no kidding!) application of this cream I was able to banish two ugly, noticeable, decade-old milium cysts with virtually no effort. AMAZING! If it just controlled my milia I'd be ecstatic, but the obvious benefit it gives to my overall skin health means I'm a LilyAna customer for life.Given the low cost of this compared to other retinol products, it's absolutely worthwhile to give it a try ... you won't be disappointed!

Retinol Purging


I really love this product! After doing some research on retinol products I was prepared for the dreaded ‚Äúretinol purging‚Äù that would happen as the product worked to keep my skin pimple free. I have combination oily skin so I knew I would be in for a ride. After 2 weeks of consistent use, I was began experiencing painful cystic acne a symptom I did not have before. However by the third week my acne began clearing up, and I noticed a tremendous improvement in the texture and smoothness of my skins. Today, more than 4 months later I‚Äôm still seeing positive changes in my skin, which include reduction of pores and improvement of pigmentation. I want to point out that I had virtually NO acne prior to adding this product to my daily routine, I was more focused on improving my overall skin texture and reducing hyperpigmentation. The product honestly works, but like all new skin care regimens it takes time.

Changed their formula


Old bottle clearly stated 2.5% retinol. New one does not. Also, retinol is now listed way down the list of ingredients instead of nearer the top, which usually means less of it in relation to previous formula. They just put in lots of the usual moisturizers most products have. Even the H. Acid is not as high on list. No like the change.

Not for everyone.


I wanted to love this product. Truly.My skin, on the other hand, didn't get the memo.About 6 weeks ago, I realized my skincare routine was lacking. AM and PM cleansing is the absolute bare-minimum a person can do, and with my under eye area and frown lines beginning to stand out, I knew I needed to step it up.I was attracted to LilyAna Naturals because of a viral Pinterest blog post that raved about the amazing results delivered by the product line. Once I saw a lightning deal on my home page, I felt it was time to pull the trigger, so I ordered this Lotion along with their Vitamin C serum.Immediately, my skin began to break out. Not tiny milia under my skin's surface; not the inoffensive blackhead here and there. Nope. It was big, painful, swollen red welts. And they cropped up in mounds of 6+ at a time, all in the same area.It started around my temples and, having been through the new skincare regimen rodeo in my teens, I thought 'it's just adjusting to the products. It has to get worse before it gets better, right?'WRONG.For the next 3 weeks, the acne went on a tour of my face, appearing all across my forehead, making its way down my sideburn area (near my ears) then up to my cheeks and nose, then back down across my chin, around my lips, and all along and below my jawline.This has been the worst case of adult acne that I've ever experienced, and I have no doubt that it's because of this product. I finished the bottles (still optimistic that things would turn around and the acne would subside) but I won't be ordering anymore. In fact, it was so bad that I had to go to a dermatologist to start a new regimen that would undo the damage caused by my month on LilyAna Naturals.Might be good for some, but buyer beware. Seems like in the case of LilyAna, when things are good, they're very very good, but when they're bad - they're horrid.

BEWARE OF OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!


This cream had overwhelmingly positive reviews so I wanted to give it a try. I used to use neocutis retinol skin cream with good result but it costs a lot more than lilyanna‚Äôs retinol cream.  I was thinking this cream has thousands of 5 star reviews so what can go wrong?  I RELIGIOUSLY used this cream twice a day as directed. Used 2 bottles despite breaking out everywhere. I did not change any other skin care or make up routine other than introducing this product!. I initially thought maybe it was purging process so I‚Äôm going to be patient.  My face was never bad to begin with. I get very occasional small pimples which usually go away in few days and few closed comedones here and there, otherwise I had pretty clear face. My goal was to aim for some extra glow.  After 2 bottles of this cream, my face is COVERED with 100s of closed comedones and cystic acne and I‚Äôm not exaggerating on numbers.  CYSTIC!!! I don‚Äôt even remember getting cystic acne as a teenager. I even broke out in places where I normally don‚Äôt break out, including my neck because I decided to apply it to my neck also. BUYERS BEWARE. It was a huge mistake on my part to get a cheap skincare product that I‚Äôve never heard of. Now it‚Äôs gonna cost me more money bc I will probably need to visit dermatologist to fix the mess on my face.  I would give this a NEGATIVE STAR if I had a choiceü§¨ü§¨üò°ü§¨ü§¨Update- I stopped using this cream and ended up going to dermatologist because my face was that bad.  I was prescribed tretoin (retinol). 5 months later my face completely cleared.  I went back to my regular moisturizer I used to use and no more acne.  Ugh what a cream.  I have never experienced cystic acne even as a teenager and this cream gave me LOTS in my 40s.  It was not fun. Do yourself a favor and pass on this product. go buy reputable retinol cream.  Don‚Äôt go cheap on your face or you will surely regret it and end up spending more money to fix it. Good luck!  Just as a side note, when I posted update to this review, my review was first blocked despite having no offensive languages.  I had to complain to amazon. When it finally got re-posted, they made sure it was the very last one under 1 star  even though many people found my review helpful.  So unless someone scrolls all the way down to hundreds of reviews, they won‚Äôt get to read my review.  Interesting.  Censor  much?

Saving Face


I was going to hold off writing this review to give this retinol cream at least a months use but a compliment from my daughter earlier today has me writing this now. She came by and within minutes told me my skin looked great, her words were..Mom, you skin looks really young today (as opposed to what? Old and tired before this? Lol) I was surprised she noticed and I told her that I've been using this new retinol cream for about two weeks. I myself noticed a glow but I didn't think it was noticeable, I was happily mistaken. She noticed.I've used retinol in the past but besides being a very expensive prescription it would leave my face red and sensitive. This cream actually is rich but doesn't leave a greasy residue behind. It absorbs completely and my skin just feels better for lack of a better explanation. There's an all around healthy glow, better clarity. This after only two weeks, I can't wait to see how my complexion improves with continuous use over time.The customer service is exceptional. I don't know how they are able to produce this product and offer it at this price, just can't wrap my head around it. All the same I appreciate a company that offers a skin care line that gives results at a price everyone can afford. The reviews are what sold me and I have to thank those folks because they just wanted to spread the word...Lily Ana Retinol is truly worthy of five star reviews.

Worth trying because the customer service is fantastic.


I gave this a 3 because it averaged out. The product, for me personally, was a 1. It made my face break out pretty horribly. However, I contacted the seller and they instantly processed the refund just as they say- and that gets a 5. They actually stand behind their guarantee and so I think this product is worth trying for your skin. if it works, you found a great inexpensive cream. If not, the company stands behind their refund policy.

My skin feels the love in LilyAnn Retinol Cream‚ù§Ô∏è


I'm thrilled with this product! I'm very fussy about skin creams, have lots of  unfinished jars of high priced face creams in my cabinet, but this is the one I (intuitively) reach for morning and night. Love the way it absorbs so quickly, like my skin craves the (all natural, 71% organic) ingredients. Leaves my face really. smooth, firm and hydrated, PLUS you can use under eyes with noticeable results! Just reordered my second jar. Super cool packaging (love the well designed handy pump)and truly affordable price. A lot of love went into creating this product.P.S. 2 years after writing the above review and a few harsh New England winters, people say I‚Äôve reversed the aging process.üòÑ Thank You LilyAna

So I waited a while before I wrote this review. I wanted to see what the results would be if I used this product religiously. The price was low so I was thinking it was not going to do much. I have purchased very expensive anti aging cream that didn't come close to what this product did.Amazing!!!! I am a 47 year old woman and was not expecting a miracle. I found myself looking at my face before foundation and thinking that I really didn't need it. One happy camper!!!!!

It actually works


I‚Äôve worked in a skin care industry for a very long time and I don‚Äôt like things that are filled with junk. This literally smells like nothing. It has a slight fragrance of whatever it‚Äôs extracted from, similar to a sweet almond perhaps, But it‚Äôs super minimal and goes away really fast. My skin it‚Äôs it up and it‚Äôs very moisturizing. My skin looks firmer and he‚Äôs happier after only three weeks of using this now. I have used Chanel, Dior, Lancome, Le Mer, Nars, Est√©e Lauder, 3 Lab, Sunday Riley, SK-II, Charlotte Tilbury, La Prairie, SkinCeuticals, Dermalogica, Shiseido, Amorepacific, Tatcha, Juice Beauty, ... I seriously could go on forever, but the reason why I‚Äôm sharing this is to let you know that this product is inexpensive and it works really well. For this price it‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs pure retinol but it‚Äôs also non-invasive for my skin and I can see firming happening. This is a great purchase for someone who doesn‚Äôt wear a lot of make up or doesn‚Äôt do skin care routine‚Äòs often, someone who uses coconut oil to hydrate their skin or oil of Olay. The price point is perfect for those not want to spend a lot of money, But the effects are there. If you want more firming benefits by a clay mask from Evan Healy, while using this product and the to go wonderfully together.Enjoy

Amazing results!


Amazing results!  Have been using for 3 weeks and have been asked multiple times if I've had a chemical peel because my skin looks so good.  Skin tone has improved drastically, wrinkles have disappeared, texture is supple, skin almost glows, generally amazing results.  I work construction and had sun spots and a permanent sunburned look, all that has disappeared.  As said, I've been asked multiple times if I've had a chemical peel done and one neighbor asked if I'd tell her who did my face lift ü§£.I love that the product smells clean and not like a girlie product, the smell dissipates too so that once it's on there's no lingering smell.  I use it once a day at night after a prebed shower.  There's no greasy feel and it absorbs great.  I love this product and will continue to use as a daily face/throat product.

A Wonderful Producr


This product works very well.  I am on bottle #3.  My skin has changed dramatically.  It is so much softer and supple.  I no longer get acne which I have been battling for over 30 years.  And the scars from past acne picks are fading away.  I‚Äôm addicted to this product and will continue to buy as long as it‚Äôs being sold.  I feel so much better about my skin.  I also have a couple wrinkles that are becoming less and less prominent.  I highly recommend this product.

Wow!


I am a (young) grandmother whose daughter is in the beauty industry so I have tried more than a few anti-aging creams.  This retinol cream is fantastic!!  It firms  and erases fine lines like no other-- and others are way more costly!  I use it religiously.-2x a day  Although it isn't drying, I sometimes use it with a moisturizer--it depends on how hydrated my skin is more than having to do with the product.  But with or without a moisturizer, it provides a smooth base for my foundation (on days that I wear it).  I have tried products that cost much more without the same results.  And, the customer service is absolutely superb!!  I have gotten personal emails that are incredibly caring with each order.  In short, this is a win-win.  Press buy now!!

Good price. Bad ingredients.


I heard about this retinol cream through a YouTube beauty expert. I was excited to try it seeing the reviews! I wish I would have skipped this all together and spent the extra money on something better. There are some serious ingredients in this lotion that are BAD.Phenoxyethanol is not good for sensitive skin. It can cause allergic reactions, eczema and nervous systems effects in infants of moms who are exposed. Xantham Gum: this is used everywhere! Wallpaper to food to paint! You can‚Äôt get away from this but it can cause digestive issues, it doesn‚Äôt break down in your body and can be toxic to skin.Again, I‚Äôm sad, but you get what you pay for.  I put this on my skin for just a few days and my skin reacted horribly to it. This includes breakouts, redness and puffy skin. I stopped using immediately.

Amazing for sensitive skin!! (See update)


So I waited a month before leaving a review b/c sometimes my skin reacts to creams much, much later. I did start off only once a week for two weeks, then twice a week for another two weeks and thereafter. I'm not sure if I'm going to use the cream every day or every other day as suggested b/c my skin does feel *borderline* dry, but a good moisturizer (e.g. nivea) solved that in a jiffy.Of course, this means that I don't see results right away, though have I in a month? Yep!!In short, if you have sensitive skin (and my skin is already naturally dry), this is a pretty great cream!UPDATE: Umm.. not sure what's going on...received my new bottle and 'retinol' is lower on the list of ingredients (left bottle). Does this mean the 2.5% of retinol as stated on the front isn't accurate?

Seeing results after a few weeks


As a beginner to a face care routine I greatly appreciated the excellent customer service. They followed up after my purchase and answered a couple of questions I had. As far as the product, I‚Äôm loving it. It‚Äôs thick and rich and I‚Äôm starting to see results. My skin has a better texture and my pores appear smaller. I was pleased that I didn‚Äôt have a bad reaction to it, as I read that in several reviews. I did however, start slowly with a small amount of the product every other night. I‚Äôm now using a full squeeze every night after I cleanse. It did cause increased dryness, to which I‚Äôm now combating with their awesome Face Cream! I love this company and their product line. I‚Äôm going to purchase the Vitamin C Serum next to help complete my face routine. On top of all that, the price is right on all of their products. Highly recommend!

Do not use if you're acne prone


After a couple of weeks of use - which is enough for your skin to acclimate - I started to have more breakouts (both inflamed and non-inflamed acne) and wish I would have checked the ingredients more closely prior to purchasing. After consulting a skin care clinic that specializes in acne, I checked the ingredients of this product and it contains isopropyl palmitate, glyceryl stearate, stearic acid AND shea butter - all pore clogging ingredients in higher concentrations than retinol (which appears midway in the ingredients list). I DO NOT recommend using this product if you're prone to acne.

Broke out constantly for 5 months!


I know it's common to break out when you first use retin products, however I didn't have a clear face for 5 months at 60 years old. Haven't broken out since my 30s otherwise.  And, these aren't normal pimples, they are the deep rooted cyst-like kind.  I tried everything that was recommended - not using every day, trying every few days to once/week with no improvement.  I now have red spots where the pimples were that take months to finally fade.  I've tried other products that worked and stopped making me break out after a few weeks of use.  The additional cost of buying anti-acne products wasn't welcomed either.

Not to be confused with Retin A, Retin A is 100 times stronger


I have dry, sensitive skin. I tried Retin A several times, even the lowest dose I could get, and my skin couldn't handle it. Too much flaking and dryness. So I decided to go with something much less strong. This is a good moisturizer, but not sure if anything but that. I'm nearly 60 and I started taking good care of my skin in my early 30's, and I think I look pretty decent for my age.  This cream is a little thick going on, I put it on over hyaluronic acid serum by another manufacturer. I sometimes put it on over snail serum from Korea, since I'm really into Korean skincare now. It takes about an hour before it doesn't ""feel"" like it's on my face. Even though I'm giving this 4 stars, I probably won't buy again because I like to experiment with various skincare lines.

Not Magic in a Bottle


I used this cream for over 2 months, twice a day. I love that is does not clog my pores and helps with acne, plus it's the perfect texture and fragrance free...all great things! BUT, I have not noticed an improvement in my fine lines and sun spots. I mostly got this for fine lines, acne scars and sun and age spots and I have seen no improvement. On the fence if I should keep trying. If you have sensitive, acne prone skin this is a wonderful moisturizer but if you are looking for an anti aging moisturizer, may need something stronger.

WARNING, 2 versions -  (old) with propolis.  Read the label on bottle you receive from Amazon.


After carefully examining listed ingredients before purchasing, I bought this item.  I used and liked the product for several weeks, when I realized I was having an eczema like reaction.  Then I found the ingredient list on the bottle is different than posted.  (many of the terms are shortened or just written in a different form.)  BUT, in the middle of the list on my bottle is ‚ÄúPropolis Extract‚Äù.  (Product of Bees, and which I am allergic to).I wrote the company and promptly heard back.  Apparently Amazon sent me an ‚Äúold‚Äù version which had propolis which they are not supposed to have in stock anymore.  LilyAna is reimbursing me for the mistake, and sending me the new version- the one with the list of ingredients posted now on Amazon and which no longer has propolis.  Seems like great customer service.

A product that Amazon has pushed... I don't recommend.


I'm sorry. I hate to write poor reviews. I was searching for a replacement for my Algenist and saw this on Amazon. Thought I would try it due to the high ratings. My mistake. I ordered the retinol cream the Vitamin C serum and the Face cream. None of these have done anything to my face, even when I have break outs there is no stinging that you would normally get with Retinols. Completely disappointed.  The cream doesn't blend well into skin.Cannot recommend

¬†I'd have to say this is my favorite of the three products I purchased, it is gentle enough to use morning and night and it is scent free, light and very hydrating. I prefer to use it at night over my niacinamide toner and serum and I wake up with soft, bright skin. It has made a difference on my texture and fine wrinkles, I absolutely love it and strongly recommend it.  This one is now a staple in my routine.

BEST PRODUCTS FOR MILIA


I battle milia around the chin area and a little around the eyes so, after using many many different products and procedures, I've been researching new ways and products that might give me better results.  It eventually led me to Lilyana Natural products.  I've been using the Retinol Cream with their Vitamin C Serum twice a day.  I first wash with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Cleansing Gel in the morning with hyaluronic acid, and at night with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Facial Cleanser with salicylic acid. (It was only by accident that they are both Neutrogena products.  I searched by ingredients to fight milia.) Both of these are followed up with the Vitamin C and Retinol (I mix them together; It seems to work great for me).  I don't use a separate moisturizer as I follow up with a mix of a brightener and hydrating tinted moisturizer.  This is plenty (for me) of moisturizing when trying to keep milia at bay.  There are also wonderful Alba Botanica products for cleansing and for a facial mask once a week.  As I said, I chose products for their ingredients and not a particular brand.  Ok, back to the product . . .I have noticed a ""significant"" change in my milia after using this for about 5 weeks.  And a few side perks:  the darker spots on my face (mostly along side jaw line) are also significantly lighter and I didn't even care about those!  Within a few days, it brought to the surface the smaller milia so I had a very slight amount of redness at first but it didn't last but 2 days and was easily covered by my tinted moisturizer.  I also got rid of any heavier creams no matter what they promised.  I didn't notice a particular fragrance - good or bad.  I think it can get a little expensive because the size of the jars are much larger than the amount of product in them.  I'm reordering after 5 weeks but that is with twice a day use.  I may cut back to once a day but, in the meantime, I'm very pleased with the results I'm getting.  I'm 72 years old and have always had very good skin with no issues other than the milia but my skin now looks so much more ""refreshed"" and even smoother.  It's taken me a long time to find the right combination of products and the best skin care routine for me but I think I've found it!!  Better late than never, right? :)

smooth cream, neutral scent


I've been using this for over 5 months now before I left a review.  I put this cream on my left hand and use my right hand to apply to face.  After applying to face I spread the rest of the cream on the back of my hand and up the forearm.  Did this intentionally to compare results.  I noticed after a short time my left hand and arm looked mush smoother and more moisturized than the right.  It was very obvious!  My face feels smoother.  Fine lines become less obvious.  As far as dark spots, I haven't noticed any difference.  The one warning I offer is not to put it directly over eyelids or close to eye area.  Caused eyes to water the next day.  Other than that I believe it's done wonders for my skins appearance.

Additional Review


So, I wrote a review saying that I loved this cream a while back and how it helped fine lines and dark spots. I‚Äôm 66 years old and had been having trouble with my lips cracking at the corners. On a recent trip to Ulta, I received some eye and face cream from It Cosmetics as a gift. So, I decided to try it out. Within a few days the cracked lips were back; I never realized they had gone away! I went back to LilyAna and BEHOLD!  Withing 3 days of using morning and night, my lips were back to healthy. This is the ONLY thing that helped the lips; not even prescription stuff from dermatologist worked. RUN, don‚Äôt walk, to buy this retinol cream!  Your face, neck and lips will thank you!

LOVE this stuff


I love this stuff. But I have a question: has anyone else experienced the retinol affecting their finger tips from the application? I started taking a prescription medication for something unrelated about two months before I started using this. A few weeks after I started using it, my finger tips and areas of my palms started to become ""pruney"" and it felt like there were tiny shards of glass in my skin. I thought it was a side effect of the medication but then it occurred to me that it might be from the retinol. Can't find any information about retinol affecting fingertips online. IJust wondering if anyone else has this issue.UPDATE: Turns out it was indeed this product that made my fingers peel. User be warned: Wash hands thoroughly after application. The peeling on my fingers let me know, though, that the product was working on my face as I didn't even experience peeling on my face. I'm now on my second bottle.

Great for even skin tone, NOT for fine lines


I purchased this product hoping to reduce the appearance of newly budding smile lines. Unfortunately, it did not accomplish this. I used this product over the course of 6 months (how long one bottle lasted) and I actually think my lines are worse than 6 months ago. Though I don‚Äôt think the product made them worse - I think the aging process just stops for no-one. I was 25 when I purchased this and 26 now, so my while my lines are pretty bad for my age, they‚Äôre definitely fine lines rather than wrinkles and I‚Äôm disappointed this product did not help.However, I am repurchasing because I still got great results (though not the one I was originally looking for)! I have very fair sensitive skin with some redness I thought was just part of me. My skin now has a much more even skin tone and is noticeably less red! It also feels very smooth and soft. This product really did give visible results, more than any other product I‚Äôve used.Because my skin is so sensitive and this was my first experience with retinol, I ramped up slowly. Apply once every third day for 3 weeks, then once every other day for 3 weeks, and finally once per day. I eventually elevated to about 9 times per week (occasionally applying twice per day as the bottle suggests) but doing it 14 times per week did leave my face feeling a little tight and red. If you apply slowly and patiently, I do not see an issue for those with sensitive skin!Also, it smells unpleasant.I still have absolutely no lines other than smile lines (no crows feet, no forehead lines). It can‚Äôt remove existing wrinkles, but maybe it can lessen new ones? Maybe I will come back to this review in a few years with an update :)EDIT: It is now 2020, I am 27, and I've moved on from this product to instead RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Facial Serum. This other product does everything and more. Though it visibly stung the first month or so I used it, so I suspect it's stronger. If you've been using this for 2 years.... time for an upgrade! But LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream is probably still a good ""first time retinol.""

Amazing results!


This is the best anti aging moisturizer I've ever used! The price is very reasonable for the size.I have only been using it for around 2 weeks, and I am already seeing a reduction in the deeper lines and wrinkles on my forehead.I worked for many years in the cosmetics industry, and have used every type of skincare, from the inexpensive drugstore stuff to the high end ""miracle"" creams. Nothing I have tried has given me results like this!I have read some other reviews of this product, and would like to address a few concerns that I noticed other people shared.Any time you are introducing a new skincare product to your beauty routine, it is common to experience a breakout. It will usually clear up after 2 weeks, as your skin adjusts to the new product. If you have concerns about the severity or duration, consult your dermatologist.When using a product that contains retinol, it is imperative that you use sunscreen religiously. Retinol is a powerful anti aging ingredient, and sensitivity to the sun is a very common effect.Lastly, if your skin is on the sensitive side, try using the product once a day rather than twice, preferably at night. This gives your skin a bit of a break between treatments.I hope you will give this amazing retinol cream a try! It truly is my anti aging holy grail!

WASTE OF MONEY


Prior, I want to tell you that I waited to write this review after trying the product for a while.  Also, I hate to disagree with so many people, but after using this product (and the Vit C and the face cream moisturizer) for TWO full months (without skipping a single day), I can tell you that this product DOES NO GOOD AT ALL! For ME it was a waste of money!!! I will come back to my old face cream. However, I am happy that for some of you, the product worked. I can affirm, though, that it does not do the same job for everyone. Don't put too much expectation on your purchase. You may be very disappointed!

Please read the directions


Oh my gosh you guys,I had no idea what retinol cream was and thought it was just a moisturizerso I was using it twice a day for three days and then I had a bunch of pimples pop up, and my skin started flaking and itching and burning.I thought I was having an allergic reaction to something so I was doing a bunch of research and found out the complications of retionol.Ive learned my lesson, please fully read about products before you buy them.If this happens to you, rub an ice cube on your face to soothe it and get some hydrocortisol cream and apply it a few times a day.My retionol burn went away within the matter of a few days but then after my skin was looking wonderful.My complexion  usually pretty red and discolored on my cheeks and forehead but now it‚Äôs all one shade and it looks gorgeous!It also feels different.I would say this product is most definitely worth it, I would say proceed with caution and don‚Äôt overdo it like I did, that was no fun.Overall I say go for it, long-term this is a good product to have

I will never spend $100 on moisturizer again. This cream is fabulous. When I first started using it, I thought I was allergic to it because my face got REALLY dry‚Äîand I mean almost like a rash! But after reading other reviews about the dryness, I realized this dryness was normal in the first few weeks of using. After two weeks of using this product, my face was very soft, a little tighter, and a lot more even-toned. I believe the dryness I experienced was the process my skin had to go through to get rid of the bad unhealthy layer of skin. Love this product!!

2 WEEK UPDATE at bottom! A good retinol moisturizer!


I've been using several days now and my 58 yr old skin is quite happy! It's light textured, absorbs quickly, and leaves a non-greasy healthy glow. I believe my pores are looking less pronounced, as wellI like that it's unscented, contains natural ingredients, the fact it is not animal tested, and especially that it's made in the USA. I love the idea of helping out my American neighbors by ""shopping local"" when at all possible.I don't have particularly sensitive skin, and have been using retinol and hyaluronic acid containing products for a few years now, so I don't feel I can speak to its performance on folks who do have sensitivities. But, based on the ingredients, it's easy for me to imagine it being a gentler cream than many out there on the market.2 WEEK UPDATE: After using for 2 weeks, I stopped at a gas/convenience store for a cup of coffee while traveling. Much to my surprise, the unknown gentleman in line ahead of me at the cash register paid for my coffee. Was it coincidence? Or was it LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream? :-)

Love This Face Cream!


I love this moisturizer.  I've ordered refills so many times that I've forgotten the number.  I apply it every night before I go to sleep. It's not greasy, so I know it won't clog my pores.  Recently, I was with a group of friends at a restaurant.  The restaurant was not crowded and a man at near-by table overheard our conversation.  I was relating a recent trip to a pharmacy where they asked for my birthdate, which I mentioned.  After the other diner finished eating, he came over to our table and said he just had to tell me how terrific I looked for my age.  He thought I was about 57 years old, the same as him.  He was shocked to hear my birthdate... I'm 70!  Of course, good genes play a part in aging, but I know how much better my skin looks since I've been using LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream Moisturizer.  Many other women have asked what my skin regimen is and I always tell them about this wonderful retinol cream.  I'm so happy with this product that I will keep buying it forever!  It's so much better than any other retinol cream I've tried, and it's very reasonably priced...great product, great price - a win,win.

Dead fish on your face?? The smell is horrid!


I'm not sure if this works and I doubt I will use it long enough to find out. The smell is absolutely terrible. It smells like dead fish.  I can't believe they sell a face product that smells this awful.  I love the eye cream produced by this same brand, but they definitely missed the mark on this one.  I only gave it two stars because I like the texture of the product, but I don't think I can get past the smell!

For Milia


I have HORRIBLE milia... enormous bumps and lumps all around my eyes. A few weeks ago, I decided I was ready to really commit to getting rid of them, so I searched for a product claiming to help clear up milia and came across this. So far, I‚Äôve been using this for a week and a half, every morning and every night. I apply it generously but lightly just after washing my face. In the short time I‚Äôve used this, I can already tell the bumps have softened and flattened! My skin does get a little dry where I apply it, and I know I should probably just use it once per day, but I‚Äôm loving the results so much that I want to continue with my established routine!The price may seem high, but it‚Äôs worth every penny and then some. It will also last quite a while, because it only takes a small amount for each application. Iwill try to update with some photos of my progress in a few weeks, but for now, I would tell every milia-sufferer to give this stuff a try! It really works!

It‚Äôs worth it, try it!


I‚Äôm writing  this review based on my own experience, every product will react differently depending on skin type. I have combo skin dry and oily, and I also have acne prone skin in my 40‚Äôs. This product has NOT made me break out and it is slowing erasing my old acne scars. It‚Äôs kinda crazy and kinda amazing and I was completely surprised. At $19 I figured it was worth the risk and it was, the loss potential was minimal but I plan on ordering more and keeping this in my routine. I wear it day and night and I don‚Äôt seem to have extra sensitivity to the sun but I also wear sunscreen on top of it. My routine day or night is wash face, toner, put on This retinol cream. If it‚Äôs day I do the same but add sunscreen and primer and foundation and it plays well with the rest of the stuff I add on top. I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to smells and I didn‚Äôt smell anything good or bad just blank scent which in my opinion is a good thing. Buy it you might love it, I do!

Results you can see


This works.Ok i could elaborate. After 2 months of use (missing a day here and there) I can clearly see fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth and eyes are softened and some are just gone. I put it on at night only because I work in the sun and need spf for my day cream. I also apply this to my bust and neck. Don't laugh, it is the best cream I have ever used and it really makes a difference. I think of this cream as ""skin food"" because it feels like my skin is drenched with nutrients after application.Downs side, I occasionally don't feel moisturized enough and apply aveno daily over the cream, but that's no big deal to me and is also dependent on the weather. Also, I wish the bottle were more environmentally friendly.For the price, light yet lux feel and surprising results, this is the best.

I tried this product for over a month and I wanted to love it. I use their face lotion as well(love that predict) But, this left me completely broken out with cystic acne the entire time. At first I thought it would calm down after my face got used to the product, but not so.

I love my Retinol Cream.


I love my Retinol Cream. I am already going to order more.I am 51 years old and have bad hyper pigmentation and adult acne. I have always been nervous about using anything with Retinol because I tried another brand about 15 years ago and it burned my face. It made my skin worse and it was extremely painful. I was browsing Amazon for a night cream when I stumbled across LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream. I read the reviews, as I always do before I purchase something new and decided, okay lets try this. I am so glad I did. My skin looks great. It is blending and lifting all my damage. It has improved my adult acne which I am just so happy about. I have only been using it at night because I am nervous about burning my skin because of my prior experience. But now I am ready to take that next step. I am in love! I have found my new skin care line.I am off to look at all the LilyAna products to make my next purchase.Thank you for helping me feel better about my skin and for being able to imagine going out without wearing make up.

Works, but not with it!  Neurotoxic reaction.


I used this product consistently for 1 month in combo with the vitamin c serum. Yes it does work! I received many compliments even from my husband who noticed a difference in my skin in that it was glowing which says a lot! I continued to use it and even family members requested to try some. So all good in the purpose of a facial serum doing a great job hydrating and keeping the skin fresh! However, this product is not worth it. After having tardive dyskinisia or involuntary facial spasms I knew it was from using these products. Prior to using these products, I barely did much to my skin, occasionally I used raw Ghanaian shea butter, but never had an issue with spasms or nerve issues. Upon using the products applying a small amount of the cream and serum in the AM & PM, the spasms began about 1 month into this routine and became pretty severe. I considered seeing a neurologist. I stopped using the retinol and vitamin c products about 2 weeks ago and no more involuntary facial spasms. There could be significant truth in the bad ingredient phenoxyethanol as one user warned as tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of neuroleptic drugs/ neurotoxins, and I had a neurological issue upon using this product.More Info about the toxicity of this ingredient phenoxyethanol""Used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics and stabilizer in perfumes, phenoxyethanol is actually very harmful. It is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through skin, especially to nursing mothers or infants. Phenoxyethanol can have an effect on the brain and the central nervous system. It irritates skin and eyes, and can cause blistering on skin as well. Although many skin care products (even some organic products as well) use phenoxyethanol in small amounts that is ‚Äúnot harmful‚Äù to skin, if you use the product multiple times a day, every day, it can cumulate and possibly affect you.""FYI also a nursing mother, Please consider your health and do more research before purchasing this product.I will not purchase again or recommend it.

THEY CHANGED IT


I just got my new bottle (I was doing subscribe and save) and the bottle is different, the ingredients are different and there is no mention of retinol concentration. Also, hyaluronic acid is much further down the ingredient list despite new mention of it on the front label. This seems deceptive and I'm disappointed. I haven't yet tried this new one, and I may return if I don't hear back about the concentration.

Works great!


I have struggled all my life to find any type of moisturizer I can successfully use on my face. I am in my late 30's with super sensitive skin that's prone to breakouts. I have been waiting to review this as my skin can suddenly decide it hates something or vice versa. The first day I used this, I used a full pump. It was way too much for me personally. It burned and my face even swelled. The next day I only used half a pump and my skin was actually soothed by it! I have been using 1/2 a pump daily ever since. My face has never been so happy! I am very impressed with this product. I have tried SO MANY other natural and non natural products to help with the effects of aging. Though other products do deliver results, my skin just will not tolerate them. This product absolutely delivers results too! One fine line has completely disappeared and I'm already seeing a couple deep set wrinkles on my forehead smoothing out. Not sure the deep set ones will fully disappear but they are definitely less noticeable and that is good enough for me! I also have issues with blotchy red patches and frequent facial rashes. This product has really helped even out my skin tone. I absolutely LOVE that it isn't a specifically night time product. I wish I would have done before and afters but I didn't because I really didn't have high hopes for yet another face product that likely wouldn't work for me. It proved me wrong! Will definitely be buying this again.

Believe what you've heard, this product works!


Purchased my first container a couple years ago and have repurchased many times. I don't know if it's ok for sensitive skin, I have dry skin and I really haven't noticed a scent, it could be unscented, I haven't paid much attention to the scent, it doesn't smell bad, I would say it's neutral I guess. The ONLY thing I'm concerned with is what it does for my skin. Since I've been using it, I can tell the difference in the softness, my skin is clearer, at my age I probably should have wrinkles but I don't and my skin just plain looks better. Sometimes I mix it with a drop or two of Almond Oil (good for under the eye dark circles) and it makes the moisturizer just a bit creamier, and it absorbs into the skin so wonderfully, I'm telling you - this product just works. Also, I'm a long time user of Oil of Olay, which I apply every morning without fail and will until the day I die but LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream Moisturizer is what I use at night and I can tell that my skin loves it. One more thing, Amazon often has this product on sale, so when they do STOCK UP!  You're welcome!

Silky Smooth Retinol Cream w Zero Side Effects (for me)


Second product I have purchased from LilyAna Naturals, and I will say it again it is not often that you find a company that goes out it's way to make sure that you are happy! No I have not been paid to say this nor have I received any free products (not that i am opposed to it, lol)  but seriously great company with lovely products.This Retinol Cream is the first I have ever used, it goes on silky smooth and I love it so far, I have had zero adverse effects from it, it is the 3rd product I apply after using my Derma Roller. I use it 2x a day and yes I have had some dead skin slough off upon exfoliating and that was welcome. My skin has taken on a new glow in a short period of time, I will be re-ordering with confidence!

Changed formula! Boo!


This is my second review on this cream. My first review was 5 stars and a paragraph long on how amazing this retinol cream USED TO BE.These guys unfortunately changed their formula.. in a bad way.The old formula used to state the Retinol  percentage (2.5%) and the new bottle does not even state a percentage.Retinol is way low in the ingredient list, and the ingredients I can‚Äôt pronounce have increased. Yikes.But the big difference is that my face does not feel the same in the morning! I used to wake up and feel the difference in my skin with the old formula. It was so soft and renewed and very obvious. My face doesn‚Äôt feel like that anymore. Such a bummer.I‚Äôve been a looong time user of this product, but with the new sneaky changes, I‚Äôm looking for a new retinol cream now. Hopefully LilyAna Naturals reads this review and sees that customers have taken notice of this new cream. It‚Äôs just does not seem potent and pure anymore.

Low cost item with results!


I purchased several higher cost items with Retinol to combat fine lines and age spots.  This one for $20 has been excellent.  If you have sensitive or dry skin, remember that Retinol products may not be for you, which is why I gave fewer stars in those categories.  This product doesn't moisturize but I've seen subtle results rather quickly.  My skin feels softer, fine lines are less visible and there is very little side effect of dry skin.  Overall, I'm happy with the product and the price!45 day update:Wow, I love this lotion! My face is so so soft, skin is smoother and even in tone. The wrinkles on my forehead seem diminished and overall, I‚Äôm so happy!! Great product

Cannot see measurable improvement, not worth the price for me


First, as much as I hate ""selfies"" and do not want to share images of my aging mug, the photos clearly show that this product did nothing to improve my skin in any way. In fact, to me, my skin looks worse in the photo I took this morning (after 35 days of use) than the day I started treatment (applied every morning and night after washing). Second, while it didn't irritate my skin at all, my skin didn't feel moisturized with this product. Third, the product comes in a pump container which wasn't mentioned or shown in the shopping process. I don't like lotion pumps because you can't get all of the product out of the container. The small container that cost me $20 lasted only 35 days. I would have to see significant skin improvement to spend that kind of money on a face cream again. I'm going back to my Ponds cold cream which has worked well for me for many years, is reasonably priced, and a jar of cream lasts me several months. Frankly, I thought my skin looked much better with daily use of my Ponds cream.  Back to what works for me.

BEWARE FRAUD! Real deal is a worthwhile product if used judiciously, watch out for the epic acne


Note: The star rating and the full original review further below refer to the product purchased from seller NaturalBeautyInc. I've just opened a ""new"" bottle after finishing the ones from NBI. It was weird because it came unsealed, and the other ones were sealed. Then I noticed it seems to be of somewhat different color (yellower) and consistency. So I checked and apparently I got it from another seller, ""emedved"". AVOID THIS SELLER! I suspect the product they sell is a fake refill (the bottle itself is way too dirty for a new bottle, incidentally).REVIEW OF REAL PRODCT:The good: makes your skin feel smoother, evens skin tone, reduces scarring. The bad: leads to crazy acne if used toomuch, dries eyelids, no help with small frown lines.And now, a more in depth history...Started using this several months ago. I have problematic skin and I have to use Rozex gel (Metronidzaole 0.75%) for my Rosacea twice daily. If I don't, I get a zit or two (especially that time of the month). I've got some mild acne scarring (nothing horrible) and fine frown lines that I wanted to do sthing about. To start off, only used a bit on my forehead twice daily for a couple of days and there were no problems, so I applied it all over my face. Good results in evening skin tone and a generally better look (that others commented on) were visible within a few days.  I was sure to do properly clean my face and apply Rozex twice a day too. However, next thing I know that time of the month rolls in and with it several huge zits, a couple of which exceeded the worst I've had before Rozex / in my teenage years and even in places I never had zits before. I'm not particularly vain, but it was so bad I opted to work from home one day and then used make up to cover it up. I wasn't sure what the cause was (this cream? work stress?). There was barely any scarring and it healed really quick, which I attributed to the cream. So I kept using it for a few more weeks, and then the same happened again (I swear one of the zits had 4 heads!). Stopped using it completely for a month, and I had no zits throughout, even during more ""hormonal"" times. But I really liked everything else it did for my skin. It is also got an amazing effect on the neck area. So I use it there and all over my face 4-5 times a week and try not to overdo it, so far so good.

Good daily product for all skin types!


I'll start off with saying that I'm probably not your typical 'audience.' I'm male and just turned 33 this year and while I have pretty youthful skin, I've been interested in 'preventative' care. I've noticed I'm starting to develop your typical 'forehead' wrinkles, wrinkles on my neck, dark eyes/lines under my eyes and slight wrinkles when I smile above the mouth.While I have pretty decent looking skin, I decided to give this a shot and stick with it. I've been using it 2x a day regularly for almost two months, (pretty much every morning/evening with some exceptions) and while I can't say I notice a HUGE difference, I did have some mild acne scars that seem to be clearing up, my pours look a lot better and there is definitely more of a 'glow' to my skin, especially for a few hours after applying it.I'll admit I don't think it has done much so far for the main concerns I had (primarily forehead/under eye wrinkles) but I don't think there is any product on the market that will really do much. I have youthful skin in general and I think most products can only reverse 'damaged' or prematurely aged skin. I've always been cautious about sun damage, etc.However with that said, my skin just does 'look better.' I'm going to continue using it as I can tell there's improvement and hopefully it does manage to tighten up some of my wrinkles. Ultimately preventing damaged skin is going to do a lot more in the future than trying to 'reverse' damage and maybe by next year it will have a noticeable effect on my developing wrinkles.

3+ Years Using and Love It


I have been using LilyAna products for 3+ years and I can't say enough good things about this line! You should try it for yourself and just see the difference! Your face will love you back! The retinol cream has definitely reduced my fine lines and wrinkles while also helping control my blemishes, reducing old acne scars, decreasing dark spots and under eye dark circles. I love the fact that its ingredients are all natural! It has a very pleasant smell and goes on light while nourishing your skin and doing all the things it is suppose to do! I love products that are exactly exactly what their company proclaims them to be and do! If you havent already tried this Retinol product I highly recommend you do! You should also check out their other products that are just as great! Thanks for making me a believer in healthy skin care products that really work and nourish your skin!

My face is never looked better. I rarely wear makeup.


This is my second bottle. It goes a long way. It is a very good value for how long it lasts. This has been my first experience with a retinol and my skin has cleared up when I used to get cystic acne it's very few and far between and usually when I haven't used the retinol for a little while. I've got to get back into it every night every single night. It has no scent whatsoever which is wonderful. I've been using it for a little while now and have noticed that my cystic acne has slowed to a halt. this I have today is the first one since I bought this and it is small. My anesthetist who does my facials has noticed a difference. Deep blackheads that could not be removed without causing a flare up of acne have come closer to the surface and have been able to be removed. Sometimes I'll see one that I had not seen before and it's literally to where I can just wipe it off literally or barely put any pressure on it and it comes out. I could not be happier. I use it around my eyes and it does not hurt my sensitive eyes and it does not Make my sensitive skin really red. The only thing is I can't put it on every single day I do it every other day or every third day because my cheeks got red and that's the only thing that I had changed. Started using it every other day and after a week everything looked back to normal. I had used Retin-A when I was young and it was samples in my mom couldn't afford to take me to the dermatologist because it wasn't covered by Medicaid. We were very poor. I never put two and two together to realize that retinol and what I use is a teenager were in the same family. I have had the best skin and I definitely will be repurchasing and I've had at least three of my friends purchase it per my results. I'm 40 now and more worried about getting wrinkles but the acne benefit has just been a plus. I can't say enough good things about this product. I'll have to try some of the other stuff in there line. if you want to reach out to me I do have a YouTube channel and I will review this and other products if sent to me. And I give true and honest reviews just like I did here.

RETINOL Cream Is A Good Thing


I've been using this cream as part of my own Korean inspired skincare regimen, for about 10 days, and I like what I'm seeing. It has improved the texture of my skin tremendously and helped with the blotchiness. I've been getting compliments. I only use this product at night. I make sure to wear sunscreen during the day as retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. My skin is sensitive so it responds to creams and moisturizers by immediately turning red. I struggle with both dry and oily skin. I get flakes in the creases of my nostrils and under my eyebrows while being very shiny on my forehead, nose, and chin. I recently came into possession of a magnifying mirror and was horrified by what I saw. I had just come off a cheese-eating jag that week and my pores were clogged with puss, my skin was red and the texture was rough. I definitely wasn't washing my face every night. I would often sleep in my make-up and sunscreen. I was using serums from time to time but they weren't helping. After resolving to get serious about having better skin, I decided to follow the Korean skincare routine. I did my research, decided 9 steps was for crazy people and settled on the following Nightime routine:1) Remove make-up with oil. I made my own by mixing coconut oil, olive oil, and jojoba oil from my own cabinets - I love it!!! I massage the oil into my skin and use a warm washcloth to help melt and remove makeup.2) I use a foaming face cleanser (Origins Checks & Balances Frothy Face Wash) as the second part of a two-part cleansing method made famous by the Korean skincare craze.3) Toner. This can be one of several I have. A Rosewater spray. Witchhazel. Pixi Glow Toner w/ glycolic acid. Either way, I finish with a water spray before applying the creams. It calms my skin and adds moisture back to my face.4) LilyAna Retinol Cream on my face, neck, and chest.5) LilyAna Vitamin C Serum. This one stings a little if I've overly scrubbed my face with the washcloth.6) Just a dab of Evanhealy Rose Vetiver Day Cream. This one is $50 but it's the only moisturizer that doesn't turn my face bright red. In fact, It doesn't turn my face red at all. I always come back to it because it works.My goals were to correct the texture of my skin, the redness of my skin, and keep it clean. I attribute the Retinol Cream with improving the texture of my skin and decreasing the appearance of my pores.

Good product ‚Äì lightweight, absorbs well and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth


I have been using this product on and off for almost a year and I have seen good results.  I am still altering it with other products I have in my bathroom cabinet from birthday/Christmas, so that is why I say on/off.  I am not a huge fan of wasting items.  With that said, this is a lovely product.  It comes in a nice pump, that is easy to use and does not clog up, and a little goes a long way.  It is lightweight, creamy, goes on smooth, and soaks into the skin nicely; it is not greasy at all.  When I use it, I cannot even tell it is on my skin; it blends in that well.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all throughout the day and helps give it a nice glow.  Also, I am not huge on make-up; I wear it maybe a couple times a week and on special occasions, but when I use this product under my make-up it helps the make-up to go on smoothly and blend better overall.  It keeps the concealer/powder from caking up or blending into the creases of my eyes or around my mouth and nose.  Using this product has also made my skin feel softer (which my husband loves and comments on frequently ‚Äì so that is a win ;-) )  My morning/night face wash regimen consists of Young Living Essential Oil products ‚Äì gentle face cleanser and toner (sometimes I just use Witch Hazel as a toner) and then I apply this to my face before I start my day or before bed.  I have had no problems with oily or shiny skin or breakouts.  This product is definitely a win.

Recommend from my girlfriend ... worth it!


Okay so ill preface this review with some hard facts.. I've never really make taking care of my skin a priority other than applying aftershave lotion to my face in the particularly drier winter months... other than that I wouldn't take the time to use anything on my skin.This product is a an absolute game changer. I've been applying it pretty much anytime after I shower... which can be 2/3 times day depending on how dirty I get. I have noticed after just several weeks of use that my skin looks significantly healthier and far fewer cracks/wrinkles. I feel somewhat dumbfounded by the thought I haven't made this a priority sooner. This has been working for me. I'm not saying it will work for everyone but I have had success and this goes especially to any men reading this... take the time and consider treating your skin to prevent aging sooner it will make a difference in your life.Sidenote; I started using this product because my girlfriend ""made"" me start using the eye cream first.. which is what sold me on this brand. It helped with the wrinkles around my eyes so I purchased this for the rest of my face. 10/10 for both types.

Exceeds Expectations


I felt compelled to offer feedback on this item because I always wonder if reviews are legit, and because I think human nature dictates that we are more likely to comment when we are dissatisfied with a product than when we are satisfied. However, this moisturizer exceeds all of my expectations.  I have been using it for less than a month and I have experienced noticeable differences - fine lines are definitely minimized and age spots are already lightened.  My skin has a much healthier glow, instead of the drab tone I usually have in winter. This stuff is crazy good and well worth the money. I am going to make sure I keep an extra bottle on hand so I never run out!

Seems to be working!


I've been using this product along with a couple of other anti-aging products for a few weeks, and I'm definitely seeing a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I'm 39 years old and while I don't have a lot of deep wrinkles, the ones I have were becoming more pronounced and I've been seeing discoloration and age spots starting to form around my temples. I've also been dealing with uneven skin tone around the area of my laugh lines.After a few weeks of using the retinol, the lines around my mouth are now much thinner and more shallow, and my forehead wrinkles are starting to smooth out.  I'm starting to see some slight lightening of the dark spots on my forehead and the uneven tone around my mouth is evening out.  I've never used foundation, but I'm finding myself not needing as much concealer as I used to use.  My skin looks and feels less tired.There is some dryness, but the moisturizer I've been using from another skincare line works really well to keep the dryness from the Retinol at bay.  I cut back the Retinol to once a day for awhile as recommended on the bottle.  I can imagine that once I've worked up to being able to use it twice a day I will see more results even faster.Because I'm using a couple of different products simultaneously, it's hard to say whether this product would work as well on its own or whether it's the ""anti-aging cocktail,"" but I will say that it was after I added in this one to the cocktail that I started really seeing results.Finally, I love the price of this product.  I've used both Rodan & Fields and Murad products, and it's just hard to keep up with the cost of those.  The LilyAna line is an affordable alternative that boasts great results.

Changed the formula


I purchased my first bottle of this over a year ago, and the cream did not have a smell, and it was a thicker consistency. Results were noticeable within a week or two. Happy about my purchase I decided to come back and buy a 2nd bottle. However, it's obvious they changed the formula because the consistency is thinner, more watery, and it smells very bad now. I don't believe it's as strong as their previous formulation either. VERY disappointing that this company changed it. Not trusting them to buy a 3rd without an explanation about what's going on with their formulation.

Not that great...


I could tell a big difference between this and the Neutrogena product I had been using.  This product does not do as good of a job at smoothing my skin and is kind of sticky.  Also, I don't like not being able to see how much is in the bottle.  My Neutrogena container was clear and had a removable lid so I could always see how much was left.

NO LONGER EFFECTIVE


After 5 years dedicated buyer of this retinol product, the company seems to have changed their formula and is NO LONGER WORKING and retinol is WAY WAY down on the list of ingredients.  The company is not being honest, charging SAME amount, but giving less of the active ingredient and thinks we don't know!?  It was a dead giveaway when they no longer touted the 2.5% by volume retinol....time to move on.  Pissed.

The best. Pure,simple AND effective.


I really like this cream. It is light and moisturising. The scent is very subtle. I really noticed a difference in my crows feet And the clarity of my skin tone. I'm not usually one to apply cosmetics very heavily. I used to wear concealer under my eyes and foundation. I actually haven't been wearing makeup too often since I've been using Lilyana naturals retinol, vitamin c serum, face cream and eye cream. Worth every penny.My skin is so smooth in color and my fine lines have receded greatly. I'm very happy with my results and have this whole system in subscribe and save.One suggestion i would give the company, make the packaging for the face cream and eye cream either different colors or put the eye cream in a completely different sized container because they look exactly like in a dimly lit bathroom and I rubbed eye cream all over my face... More than once. I mean, it's not going to kill me but I do like to use my products as intended.I know it seems a little pricey for the whole system if you are used to using drug store creams. I've tried so many over the counter ""miracle"" creams from the drug store and they just don't do the job. Lilyana naturals is not only more natural, it actually does what it says it's going to do.But there cream. But all the cream and give it a few weeks. You'll see results and be happy you switched to Lilyana naturals!!!!

My skin is amazing- but


Whhaaaat! My skin is absolutely amazing just a couple weeks after using this daily. I absolutely love it! No burning sensation, applies well and has significantly reduced my texture. However, it does contain Phenoxyethanol which, from my research, is in most every retinol. The fact that the ingredient is banned in other countries is a bit concerning though.

By Far - The Best Retinol Product on the Market


I found out about this product and company from Bailey Sarian, hostess of Dark History and Murder, Mystery, and Makeup. I liked how candidly she described the product and watching her videos, I could see a visible difference in her skin. I purchased my first bottle 5 months ago and I am hooked! Never has a retinol product felt so good on my skin, and showed such rapid results. I love all of the natural ingredients and it literally feels like I've come home from the spa every time I put it on. It smells lovely and makes my skin look dewy and vibrant, healthy and clear. I am very satisfied with this product and have since purchased other LilyAna Naturals products, which have all been excellent as well. Try it - you'll be happy you did and your skin will thank you!

Amazing Retinol that works!


This retinol work!!! The compliments flooded in. But remember to use lotion before you add the retinol at first. Retinol is so strong. Always use lotion after retinol! And sunscreen!First week‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîBasically you need to sandwich the retinol in lotion the first couple weeks & always add sunscreen if you go outside .Second week‚Äî-After your skin gets use to retinol after 2 weeks use the lotion only at the end.3rd week‚Äî‚Äî try morning at night with retinol but add lotionExtra tips.In the mornings‚Äî‚ÄîUse Drunk elephant vitamin c and sunscreen in the morningAt nite‚Äî‚ÄîAdd in drunk elephant hydraulic acid for the skinAm formula+ wash face+ dry with clean cloth+ add toner/ wait 1 min+ add vitamin c/ wait 1 min mins+ add lotion/wait 30 mins+ add retinol (It's best to apply vitamin C before retinol, as vitamin C has a lower pH than retinol)./ wait 10 mins+ add lotion+ eye creamPm formula+ wash face+ dry with clean cloth+ add toner/ wait 1 min+ add hydraulic acid / wait 1 mins+ add lotion /wait 30 mins+ add retinol/ wait 10 mins+ always add lotion after retinol.+ eye creamAlways layer by consistency.

Miracle Face-lift Cream!


I ordered this because of the great reviews about both wrinkle and discoloration correction, and I am very pleasantly surprised at how effective this is. I have been using ROC since my 20s, but on a bi-weekly  basis. In my late 30s, I wanted to start supporting my skin more, and that product and my skin are not compatible for everyday use. Breakouts, irritation, dryness. Bleh.So, I got Lilyana's retinol cream, and in 4 days I have seen amazing results. My skin has started clearing up, I have no redness or dryness and my forehead ""concentration wrinkles"" are all but invisible. And those suckers are deep; I'm a huge ""frown-thinker"" and ""eyebrows-up"" kinda person.I am absolutely impressed with this brand, and I will be using it exclusively from now on!

Great cream... but not for oily skin.  :(


I was really hoping this would work for me but it didn't.  I'm fair skinned and have rosacea and adult acne. I have extremely sensitive skin and react to everything (witch hazel, alcohol, toner, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, vitamin C, etc). The plot twist on that is that I have very oily skin, which makes it hard to find products that tackle the grease yet won't cause a reaction. I've been using Image Ormedic products which seems to do the trick. My esthetician recommended a retinol cream, which I can use about every 3 days. When my last tube ran out, i decided to try this since the price was so much better.Unfortunately, it just wasn't right for me. It's really a beautiful cream with gorgeous texture, but it's much too rich. I would use a very small amount- slightly bigger than a grain of rice- but would still wake up with my face feeling like I had rubbed Crisco on it. I would usually also wake up with a fresh batch of whiteheads. The two times I tried a larger amount- about pea sized- I broke out even more and my nose got really red.I tried it every few days for about 5 weeks. Part of the problem might be because I was using it in the summer when it was hot and very humid- - But I think I'm just going to bite the bullet and shell out the money for my old brand that's a better fit for my skin.  If you have dry or normal skin, or need some more moisture in the winter, I'd recommend it.

Amazing for very sensitive skin and fine lines around mouth


This is the best retinol cream. I was a heavy smoker for 15 years (yes gross I know) and quit, but had some fine lines I did not like. This has literally almost reversed my fine lines around my mouth completely. I wish I had taken a before picture, but honestly this stuff has made such a difference. I also have extraordinarily sensitive skin, like to the point where I have had a dermatologist look at me and say ‚ÄúIn my whole career I‚Äôve never met anyone as sensitive as you‚Äù. I was also diagnosed with something called ‚Äúmultiple chemical sensitivity‚Äù which is not really a disease, more of a condition where you just react adversely to pretty much...well, existence. I could tolerate this and in fact it has caused me no problems except for minor redness or dry spots occasionally here and there but it‚Äôs not even that noticeable, I would have to point it out. I have had my face swell up like a bee stung me with almost every other retinol cream, so I will take that! also these are just normal side effects of literally any retinol. And I use it daily! You can use it every other day if you are bothered, or my solution which is mix it with a regular moisturizer (which they also make) problem solved. Hands down 5 stars and I‚Äôm so leery of anything this highly rated but in this case I can say it‚Äôs  legit. If you are highly sensitive or just prefer more natural options this is for you. Oh and a TINY drop is all you need and it lasts forever. Months.

I use this at night mostly since retinol is sensitive to sun light. It is a great moisturizer and while I haven‚Äôt seen huge improvement in the deep wrinkles I have, but they haven‚Äôt gotten worse.

Disappointing Results & Slightly Irritating to My Skin


I didn't know what Retinol was exactly but was willing to try it. I also bought a small jar of Olay night time moisturizer.  Oh darn, neither product made my face look 23 years old again.....but the Olay just had a better ""feel,"" if that makes sense.  The LilyAna cream was a little irritating to my skin and made my face a bit red. Nothing horrible, mind you, just didn't quite like the feel of it. I gave it 2 weeks but then stopped using it. The pump applicator was a plus, tho.I don't really like sticking my finger into the jar of the Olay, but that's the way it goes..  I'm still using the Olay Night Time  Cream and bought a jar of their Daytime Cream as well since it has sun protection in it. I've had no irritation from either Olay product.I don't spend a ton on beauty products.....about $20 is my limit. So there may be more expensive products that work well too....but I have to live within my means.

Great product


This is an awesome cream. I wanted to start using a retinol product and this one was so highly rated and inexpensive I figured it would be a good one to try. It‚Äôs a thicker cream, which is great for night time. No real scent to it which is perfect  for me, not a fan of strong scents on my face. I‚Äôve been using it about 10 days and my husband who literally doesn‚Äôt notice if I (or anyone else for that matter) color my hair purple or get a facial piercing commented that my skin was looking awesome... haha. I have some scarring from cystic acne on my jaw line and I wanted to use retinol in my skin care regiment to help with discoloration and indented scars. I‚Äôve been using a derma roller as well and I think the two together have really helped. Skin is soft and really glowing. Be super careful about sun exposure- SPF and a hat are a must!

This did not work for me!


I wanted to love this moisturizer so badly. I know that with retinol, you have to give your skin time to get used to it. Let me tell you all, my skin reacted for WEEKS and I had new zits by the hour. There was no improvement whatsoever. Unfortunately, I decided to give up and make salicylic acid my active ingredient of choice. Overnight, my skin cleared up and after 4 days, all irritation is gone. If this works for you, great, but if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin, be very cautious.

Every day got better and better with my makeup and the appearance of my skin WITHOUT makeup.I don‚Äôt feel moisturized from this product and this DOES NOT help my rosacea breakouts.

I like not love it. Scent is fine. Not pretty or anything sweet. Fairly plain. Takes a while to ‚Äúdry‚Äù before moving onto make up. Been using 1-2 times per day and have noticed a very slight decrease in my monthly acne appearance. Recently added in hyuloronic acid and it‚Äôs working awesome together as a team.My skin care routine was really basic. Wash with a Norwex cloth daily. Twice a month exfoliate with a daily scrub ( bc my skin is so sensitive. Anything stronger and my face is on fire!) and moisturize with another brand.Decided to switch out my old brand which I‚Äôve been using 5/6 years. Now I‚Äôm in my late 30s with monthly acne and forehead wrinkleWash routine is same but now I use this and the acid and it‚Äôs much healthier. Makeup looks better.

Do you know your skin?


We all read reviews. We all have either a pro or con. So, FOR MY SKIN TYPE, normal, this works. I just started using it, so too soon to tell you results. What I will tell you is my thoughts. The consistency is creamy,  a little goes a long way and there is no smell. If you want perfume-y, then you will be disappointed. This is unscented for the most part. If you have used other Retinol products, then you are familiar with its smell. This is what you get with LilyAnas product. Its not unpleasant.I get a slight tingle, but no redness, so I feel as if it is working.If you have sensitive skin, YOU ARE GONNA GET TINGLING AND REDNESS and maybe some discomfort.But it may not work for you, that doesn't mean its a defective product. Try Vitamin C creams and serums. If you are unsure of your skin type, research before you buy anything.If my old brain can remember, I will try and do updates as I go along.

I love this cream!


I have very, *very* dry skin although fortunately I'm not sensitive to anything except some perfumes.  Fortunately, the scent in Lily Ana products is very mild although quite noticeable and doesn't bother me at all!  I just finished my first full container jar of this cream, and I absolutely love it!  It took me two months to use it all, since I applied it only at night.  I had tried another retinol cream (RoC) which burned when I put it on my face -- I discovered it has salicylic acid in it after I bought it which is awful for dry skin, so had to cross that off the list! --  but with this product I never had even a moment's discomfort.  I'm going to get another container as soon as the budget permits.  It goes on easily, my skin absorbs it wonderfully, and it may not be making me look years younger but it certainly helps me keep from looking any older!  I've also been avoiding the sun for at least 20 years, so most people think I'm in my early 50s although I just turned 65.  It's the small wrinkles that give me away, I suspect.I only have small beginnings of wrinkles, crows feet, between my eyebrows, and my laugh lines -- so far.  Since I started really trying to slow down the aging process a few months ago, I've tried a lot of different companies' products and have repeatedly found the less expensive ones to be as good as -- or better than -- the name brands! My skincare routine is four steps:  cleanse, tone, essence/serum, and cream.  I use products from a variety of companies, and only use the retinol cream in the evening, followed by a mask to hold all that goodness in so it can soak into my face and really do good during the night.  And during the day I of course follow with a sunscreen on my face, and arms and legs since I live in Florida.  I use the Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46, which really is great; it uses a clear zinc oxide formula that comes highly recommended, so even though it's expensive, a little goes a *long* way so it lasts forever.It's amazing how much better my skin is looking now that I'm really taking care of it.  The retinol cream soaks so well into my skin it's unnoticeable after a few minutes.  My skin tone has evened out, and my face is smooth with my wrinkles definitely diminished.  I realize a retinol cream can't make me look 40 again, but if I can look younger than my calendar age I'll be very happy!  I plan to continue using it as long as Amazon sells it -- and I'm also going to try some of the other Lily Ana products, which should be great if they work even half as well as this cream!

Super Moisturing with Retinol Fringe Benefits


This is a great product, I‚Äôve been using it for years and it certainly does work well to control breakouts. I‚Äôm 43, with oily acne prone skin. This retinol helps to keep it in check. I‚Äôve strayed a few times over the years, only to have my skin punish me, and have always come back. What I like about this cream is that it‚Äôs clean feeling, lightweight, and no scent. It‚Äôs super moisturizing without being ‚Äúoily.‚Äù I like to put it on last, super thick, and watch my skin eat it up. I pair it with Sunday Reily products ‚Äî like A+ retinol (if I really want to zap my skin into compliance) and the Luna sleeping oil or CEO glow. Nighttime routine: Dr. Hauschka Clarifying toner + Acure Incredibly Clear spot treatment (I put it all over my face) + Sunday Reily Luna Oil + thick layer Lilyana Retinol cream. My skin wakes up happy every time!

Bought to help with Sebaceous Hyperplasia


I've started developing sebaceous hyperplasia on my cheeks.  At first I thought it was just a few marks from maybe sun damage, but another would appear, and another, and another.  This was over maybe a 3 year period.I finally spent an afternoon researching until I determined what it was and how to treat it.  I used two creams before this one and neither seemed to be improving.This LilyAna Naturals Retinol A cream is helping improve them, though, I'm sure of it.  It's slow, and ever so slight, but they are improving.  I wanted to be sure before I wrote a review, but even if my current improvement is about as good as it will get for me, this purchase was still excellent.If after another 5-6 months, there is even more improvement, I will come back here and update my review.

This is the one!


I've been experimenting with facial moisturizers for a while now.  The one I had been using for years was finally discontinued.  Since then I've got a rather impressive graveyard of moisturizers and night creams ending up there for any number of reasons.  I landed on this one about 6 weeks ago and I really am impressed.  I have quite a few lines around my mouth and chin and although I know I will never be able to be rid of them for good, I am trying to soften them up a bit so they are not quite so pronounced.  I have noticed a difference with this product.  I'm probably as critical as any woman when looking in the mirror but I do have to admit I see the differences.  The foundation I use goes on smoother and the lines are not nearly as obvious as they have been before.  Even if it's subtle, I will declare it a success and plan on using it exclusively.  I did a subscribe a save with it, which I haven't done with any other products.  I can only suggest to try it.  I love the way it goes on my skin, it is odorless, which is HUGE with me, and there is absolutely no skin sensitivity.  Great product, the search is finally over.

Holy grail skin care: Retinol cream, vitamin C and chemical peels


I've been using this cream since 2018 when I decided that I needed to kickstart my anti-aging skincare regimen at 27. I have very sensitive skin with atopic dermatitis and skin allergies. My skin was rough, patchy and I started developing fine lines on my forehead.When using a retinol cream, you're going to get the retinol uglies meaning your skin type flip flops, you may get some acne here and there and dry skin patches in the first two weeks. This is usually when most people quit because they think it's not working and they stop using it. I tell you this, there is a light at the end of the tunnel because after those two weeks, you'll see the glowy skin and you'll feel the softness. You can always tell if someone uses retinol/retinoids because of the tell-tale glow and softness. Forget about highlighter or glow serums because this is coming from within.If you're looking for something to take away the super deep wrinkles or erase 40 years off your face, realistically that's not going to happen without some deep chemical peels or lasers. But if you're looking for a clear complexion, baby soft skin and smoothing of those fine lines, this will help especially if you start earlier in life. My complexion was very rough from all the topical steroids and eczema flare ups but this is what turned my skin around. I'm 30 now and I'll have to eventually up my anti-aging products to prescription Retin-A (tretinoin), more frequent fruit enzyme peels, vitamin C serum and even more sunscreen, but this retinol cream will continue to be a part of my skincare regimen. If they made this retinol cream into a body lotion, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

Meh....


I purchased a retinol cream from another brand and it made my face a little ""tingling"", which in turn made me think/feel that it was doing something MORE than just moisturizing my face.  This cream doesn't give the same effect.  It does moisturize but beyond that - I don't think it does anything further.  I'm not slamming this product - it's just not ""doing it"" for me.  I'm almost done with the bottle and when it is finished I will return to the other product (fingers crossed its still not out of stock).  There is no scent, it's not a heavy cream and after cleaning and toning my face I put this on.  It doesn't impede my makeup application - so give it a try.  Your experience may not be like mine.  I tried this on a ""deal"".

Great for easily irritated skin


I had to come back and update my review. I am usually a prescription retin-a, but decided to give this a try since it‚Äôs a milder formula. Initially I mentioned I didn‚Äôt notice much difference to my skin, but after closer inspection, I must say my skin has been looking really good. Not to mention this doesn‚Äôt peel my skin, and it can be used on your neck as well without irritation. This is a great alternative for those who are not able to get a prescription strength formula, and for those whose skin is too sensitive for retin-a. I like this because I don‚Äôt have to think too much about it. I can use it nightly, without or without moisturizer and I wont experience any peeling. My only drawback is the packaging, because you can‚Äôt tell how much product is actually left/in the container.

Great anti-aging product that won't break the bank.


I've been using Lilyana's face cream and retinol cream for a least a couple of years and love their products. The retinol cream I use mainly at night (it's a heavier cream and I have combo skin) and day I use the face cream. Occasionally in the mornings I dab a little around the eyes if they are a little puffy and certain areas that need it. I feel like it helps soften and make less visible the common areas where wrinkles form (upper forehead, vertical line between the eyebrows, and corners of mouth, neck lines). Certain parts of my face are more sensitive to the retinol and will flake a little so I don't use it that much on those areas (near the hairline by my eyebrows especially). Otherwise I have sensitive skin and eyes and I don't have a problem. The cream lasts awhile so I think the value is good (though the price may have just gone up recently). I like that there is just a mild scent (not overpowering).

I have used this for 2 months & will keep using it!


This is my second bottle of this. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I loved it until I ran out! This stuff works great while moisturizing. It is a thick cream not a serum. I feel it need to be thick and moisturizing since it is a retinol. Otherwise you might find it dries your skin out. I took a few weeks off of using this when I ran out and my skin began to look dull and my fine fine wrinkles around my eyes began to show again. One week into taking it again and my skin is smoother, plumper and the lines are done.Seller was quick to ship, packaging was great and product size is great as well. A little goes a long way. I waited to write this review after 2 months of use to be sure I really got to try it before giving my opinion. I purchased this on my own and my review is my personal opinion. I would order from this seller again. Thanks so much

It's a toss up


I do like how my skin feels with this lotion.  It is light and fluffy, and not greasy.  Do I notice any difference to the skin around my eyes when I use it?  No, I'd like to say yes, but I haven't noticed any difference.  I've used several bottles though, and I think I will continue to use it.  It's pretty expensive for how long the bottle lasts.  There are just SO MANY face lotions out there, with so many of them making giant claims about the efficacy of their products...  I just don't want to go through trying a bunch of expensive creams that may or may not make a difference.One thing I will add about this product (since I've used probably 4-5 jars of it) - one of the jars was bad.  When I put it on my face, it smelled fine, but I was noticing that by the time I got in bed, there was this bad smell, and I kept thinking (since I went to bed right after applying) that a cat had pooped under the bed or somewhere I couldn't find.  I finally figured out that after a couple minutes on my skin, the product smelled rancid.  It didn't smell bad right out of the jar, which is weird and why it took me a while to diagnose.  But eventually I realized that my hands smelled in bed.  The smell was coming from them (and my face, presumably too, but it's tough to smell your own face).

When I used this product the first time, my skin was noticeably glowing and clear in the mornings. I have sensitive skin and am 34 years old, so I was so disappointed when I found a cream that worked and it smelled so badly when I reordered. So, happy ending, and great customer service.

I like it


This is the first retinol product I've ever used. I got it because I started noticing some fine lines around my eyes, and some red spots on my cheek that I didn't recognize. It's done pretty well on the fine lines, I can barely see them now without studying really close to the mirror. It hasn't done anything to the red dots, but I have no idea what they are (almost look like little blood vessel spots). This also hasn't done anything to one dark spot I have. It doesn't dry me out and I haven't any reaction at all  I started out pretty heavy too, using it twice a day like the bottle recommended, but since reading up on it I know that's not how you should start. I never had any side effects though. No drying or redness. I've been using it for about 6+ months now.

First time user of facial product


So, I am getting up there in age (mid thirties) and have never used any facial products. All my life I‚Äôve just used my body lotion after the shower.Recently I started looking into facial products; not that I have any issues, but I came over a post that encouraged me to start using beauty products  to avoid lines, wrinkles etcOf course no one wants these so I panicked and started doing some research.I have purchased this along with some other products and the others did burn my face because I believe I have sensitive skin. This so far has worked really well for me in keeping my face moisturized and after one bottle I have not had any allergic reactions or negative effects.I have just ordered my second bottle as I have been using this day and night. I also think it has lasted long enough for the price so I believe it‚Äôs well worth it.I don‚Äôt think I have seen any difference in my face but I have hopes that maybe one bottle is not enough to do the trick. My husband did say he can see a difference but oh well. I think it‚Äôs worth continue using.

You know you‚Äôve spent more!


I‚Äôve had this for about 4 months so I can do an honest review. First off, the price is unbeatable for a retinol product. It‚Äôs hard to find anything good under 50$, much less under 20-25$. I began using this as soon as I received it in June. I‚Äôve been a shopper for a good moisturizer that could help with aging signs for a long time. I have 50 different ones in my cabinet. All either barely used or 1/2 full.  Either too heavy or too greasy or drying (yes, some moisturizers leave my face dryer). So when I came across LilyAna‚Äôs, I figured what the heck; good reviews and good cost, I won‚Äôt be out much if it stinks. Like I said, I start as soon as I get it. At first I was concerned because it seemed thick but I realized it goes a LONG way. You don‚Äôt need much.  I love the way it leaves my face feeling. Soft but not heavy. Additionally, fine lines and ‚Äútiredness‚Äù under my eyes have disappeared. I look alert even if I‚Äôm not! I‚Äôm 43 and look like mid 30s. I‚Äôll take that!  But it goes where I go and it may be the first moisturizer I‚Äôll actually finish! Buying more!

Doesn't blend/absorb well, check the ingredients


I can't say if it's effective since I barely used it, but I do want to comment on the formula/texture(?).I tried adding this to my night routine but it didn't work out. This thing takes forever to blend/absorb into my skin. There is a very noticeable white cast/smear and it takes a whole lot of rubbing in for it to disappear. It's a huge chore. I can't imagine applying this on a busy morning.I do have a lengthy skincare routine though. Maybe it's because I already have so other things on, but I don't have this issue with any of my other products. Even if that's a factor, it'd still a minus since people who are actively into anti-aging are not going to be using just 1-2 products.And apparently it has an ingredient that's banned in other countries. Of course every country's regulations are different, but considering how slow  the FDA is, I'd rather play it safe. I'm kinda glad this didn't work out for me.

Very Hydrating


This is by far the most hydrating moisturizer I have ever used. I used this every night for 2 months and I was amazed at how my face look every time. It really soaks in the skin my skin looks and feels like i just got a facial. The longer it sat on my skin the smoother and soft my skin became. One time my man kissed me while I had this on and he was like ‚Äúdamn your skin is so smooth‚Äù lol in the morning i wake up my face is so radiant and so supple. I can‚Äôt say it helped with my acne because i still get hormonal acne from using birth control but it definitely helped with wrinkles and acne scars and pores

Update:  This is not the same product


Update:  I've been using this for two or three years now but the last two orders I've received are not the same product.  It not only has a different smell to it, the slight ""sting"" I would get when I applied it is gone.  This cream feels very much to me like the amount of retinol in the product has been significantly reduced.  I'm also getting acne on the side of my face, which the original cream always controlled.  If this is the case, I'm really disappointed in Lilyana Naturals for pulling the wool over those of us who have been buying the product for so long.  I'm going to finish the bottle I have and move on to another product.Old review: I read an article over a year ago in GQ that encouraged guys to start using retinol.  This is the only brand I've tried so far, but I have to say it's amazing.  It actually does get rid of wrinkles, and I've been using it now for months through Amazon's subscription plan.  I've also run into friends I've not seen in awhile who have told me how smooth my skin is and they can't figure out why (I don't tell them, I just act surprised).

What kind of sorcery is this?! Amazing!!


I‚Äôm not sure what magic combination of ingredients is in this little bottle, but it‚Äôs amazing! Trying to find something more affordable than my Murad routine, I chose to give this retinol cream a try. It is extremely rich yet light, with absolutely no scent, and a little bit goes a very long way. It absorbs relatively quickly and moisturizes for many, many hours. I use it at night and wake up in the morning and my skin feels soft and smooth. But the sorcery is what gets me! After six months of Murad‚Äôs retinol cream I‚Äôve not noticed much difference in my skin, but I‚Äôve only used this cream for two days and swear I can tell a difference. My skin seems to already be smoothed out, plumper, and with less fine lines. I have never left a review for any facial product with this kind of glowing recommendation. This is going into my subscribe and save for sure. Highly recommend!!!!

This is THE BEST


I am 33, had a baby right before I turned 31, prior to that I had cystic type acne all my life that I never grew out of, then got acne in places I never had it before when I was pregnant, and let's face it: growing a baby does stuff to your body, some stuff you never come back from, and I stayed pretty hormonally imbalanced for a long time. I'm very fair skinned, and every pimple (popped or unpopped) left a lasting pink scar on my face, requiring concealer months long after it's official departure. A reminder of the pimple that had been/had almost been that needed to be hidden as more approached. I'd used the classic proactiv with the best results for years and years, and went right back to that with the same results of ""it's not 100%, but it's better than everything else."" And on top of it, I have always had an incredibly oily face and scalp. My mother first suggested something with hyaluronic acid, and that was becoming increasingly popular while I was pregnant and was not supposed to use it, so I didn't give it another thought. But with my boy about to be turning 2, and my skin still so confused, I figured I'd give it a shot. I read outstanding reviews of this stuff, and figured I'd give it a shot. I got the serum, and the retinol moisturizer, and got the regular face cream and eye cream in case my skin got dry. I just read a bunch of people talking about how the first week or two you use it, it can cause dryness and some peeling, so I figured I should have some of the basic stuff, too. I don't know if it's just that my skin was used to the harshness of benzoyl peroxide on the regular, or that I'm SO greasy, but I didn't experience any of the dryness, redness, or irritation that a lot of people report the first couple weeks. And I really went balls to the wall with this, and cut the proactiv out completely. Scary prospect for me. But no joke, just using the serum and the retinol moisturizer every day, within a few days my skin calmed down a massive amount. The moisturizer is a little on the heavy side (although I used it pretty liberally) and is a little heavy for use under makeup if you're heavy handed like me, but I'd still put some on, let it soak in awhile, and just wipe my face down real quick with a cleansing cloth, and it was all good. By the end of the first week, I'd had no new pimples, and noticed dramatic lightening in the marks from old pimples, along with a generally more even skin tone, and my face felt smoother, softer, calmer, and looked it, too. I have not turned back. The best part is that my skin is also not as greasy as it was before, and I have FINALLY found a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out worse. And my skin just soaks up that serum, and that stuff is AMAZING.

Did not work for me


I was excited to try this product after reading many positive reviews. I‚Äôve used this product for two weeks and it‚Äôs horrible. It has left my skin very dry. In addition, it‚Äôs thick and doesn‚Äôt absorb well.This, unfortantly, was the worst product I have ever used. This is an updated review.I reordered Olay Regenerist and it just arrived.

Horrible horrible for my skin!


I have mildly oily skin and it is not sensitive.  I tried this for 3 weeks.  I started off at 2 times a day, then down to every other day in hopes to see progress.  My skin broke out in little bumps ALL OVER and those became these tiny white heads.  Some reviews said to work through the break out.  It was for waaaay too long and was embarrassing.  AND, my skin's oil glands in reaction were off the charts.  I was a greasy mess just a few hours into the day!  I wanted to believe all of the reviews but this was the worst experience with creams I've ever had.  My skin has about half of the break out left and I haven't used it now for about 5 days!  I'm self conscious and miserable.

Great for aging neckline.


I bought this cream initially because of my sagging neck. I'm only 40! That's too young for a saggy neck.  I wanted a product that was natural and affordable, and this was the product for me!  I used it morning and night for about a week and started seeing positive results.  I later added the vitamin c serum beneath it on my face.  I've been using this product for about a year now and am so delighted with the results.  My skin is super sensitive, and this project is so gentle that I've not had any reactions to it.  It's thick enough that I can even skip foundation if I'm in a rush and just add my full coverage powder.  I love it and would definitely recommend.

Retinol is 2.5% BY WEIGHT, not by STRENGTH


I feel the product works  well, and it was  what I was looking for as a starter retinol product. It is somewhat moisturizing and I have had no redness or irritation- I suspect mostly due to the low concentration.to that point,  I feel that customers should know that the 2.5% is by weight, not by strength, (2.5% is well above the legal limit!) A quick calculation shows this cream is something in the ball park of 0.025% which is exactly what I wanted. It is a little annoying that the seller keeps saying it is 2.5% when people are asking, because they are being intentionally deceptive, knowing that most customers don't understand the difference.Anyway, if you are like me and just starting out with a retinol, this is a really good product for the price point. The packaging is cute, it is in a pump to preserve product and it has a very mild smell, not perfume-y. I do not have sensitive or problematic skin, I was just looking for a little brightening and smoothing to up my skin care game. So far, so good. I think I'll probably re-order, but only if I can get it ""on sale"" again.

Not just for women, by the way!


Looking at the pics here and reading the reviews might lead someone to believe that this is a woman's cosmetic product but men like it too.  At least this man does and quite a bit!  I gave this a shot after seeing an offer on Kinja Deals and since I've had overwhelming luck with their offers, I thought I'd give it a shot.  But honestly, I wasn't expecting a whole lot.  I'd used various moisturizers and stuff before and mostly they just made my skin greasy.  I'd come to just use moisturizers when I had an issue, like wind or sun burn or razor irritation.So I went into this thinking, ""Well at this price how bad could it turn out?""  Given that it includes Retinol and I had read the product info/precautions, I expected a little dryness or redness in some areas.  So if I noticed any reactions, I would just stop using it as frequently.  And I *did* see a little dryness and peeling around the corners of my eyes on the first couple of days so I stopped using as frequently it in those specific areas.But what I wasn't expecting was the overall effects; there was a noticeable improvement in my skin tone, color and a reduction in small lines.  I saw this after only a few days use, and as I started using it in the morning and before bed, the improvements continued at a faster pace.  Even friends remarked that I looked 'healthier' and looked like I had been 'finally spending more time outdoors'.  I actually had a complexion as opposed to looking like I spent most of my time in front of a computer (which I do, LOL)!I've got to say, I am impressed.  I've tried a number of men's facial products over the years but I've never seen a change as dramatic as those I've witnessed from using this product.  I'm a convert and a fan!  I'd highly recommend this product to anyone and I plan to keep using it from now on.UPDATE:  Just caught a sale and bought another container.  I love it so much I didn't want to run out.  And I got a nice personal email from Tammy at Natural Beauty noting that I bought again and how much they appreciated my business.  Very impressive vendor, will be looking to buy other products from them!

Used to be a 5 star product


This *was* a great product. I tried multiple times since I started using in June to leave a 5 star review, but kept getting a message from amazon saying there was suspicious review activity on the product so they weren‚Äôt allowing reviews. And I wish I was coming here to leave a 5 star review, alas, they‚Äôve either changed the product or used bad ingredients because not only does it smell like fish, it is making me break out. Plus they were completely out of stock recently. I had initiated a return on the stinky bottle, went to buy a new bottle and they were out. It came back in stock a bit later and I thought surely the stickiness would be cured. Alas the replacement bottle smells just as bad so I‚Äôll be sending both back and switching brands because what a pain in the butt! It‚Äôs really u fortunate as this was a fantastic product that completely cleared up the acne fast and made my skin look amazing!

This is amazing. If you're on the fence, do it!


I honestly never ever take the time to write reviews on Amazon .... (I know I should because I always read reviews before buying!) But this product has helped me SO much I feel like I owe it to the seller. I'll try to keep this short(ish) but I started getting terrible acne after having my daughter. Literally after a year I was having the worst hormonal and cystic acne. I am 28 and have never had acne this bad. I tried so many things and nothing was helping. I decided to try the retinol cream after I was already using the vitamin c serum and started to see it helping lighten up my scarring. I've only been using these products together for about 12 days and my skin looks SO much better and keeps clearing and my pores are getting smaller too! I'm so happy I found this product. Thank you! If you're thinking about trying please at least give it a try. I use the retinol every other night, I let it completely soak in for 20 minutes before adding my serum and moisturizer on top. Hope this reviews helps someone else out there!

Gave me the WORST acne of my life!


I know there are a lot of positive reviews on here, and that is why I purchased initially. I have used the cream for nearly 4 weeks now, and I have had the worst breakouts of my life. I usually have very clear skin, and only purchased to help with fine lines that are developing, as I‚Äôm turning 30 soon. I have never had any issues with acne, not even as a teenager. Never. After using this cream for about a month, my face has broken out with huge cyst-like acne. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm going to scar! I really wish I would have just gone to a dermatologist rather than buying a cream on Amazon with, yes good reviews, but not everyone‚Äôs skin is the same! Mine certainly did not react well to this cream (as I had heard sometimes happens with retinol but is supposed to go away in a couple weeks) and I have gone from zero acne to a face/forehead/neck full of it. Worst choice ever. Go to a dermatologist!

The ingredients were just changed and retinol which why I buy this in lower on the list. Now the label has some bs about ""hyaluronic acid"" which I don't give a rap about. I have rosacea, and there might be new ingredients altogether, which could set my very sensitive skin off. This is absolutely wrong to sell me this garbage and say it's the same thing.

It took about 3 weeks of every other day (at night)  to get my face to play nice with the retinol cream. I did have a ""purge"" and a few pimples pop up pretty quickly but hey, I'm ok with that. I'm 31 and its nothing I can't handle.  My rosacea has CALMED WAY down. I can now leave my house feeling confident without make-up (Thank you baby Jesus)Acne isn't as bad however I have to take into consideration that most of what I see I feel is stress and or hormonal related. I just started adding the cream to my neck and it's getting the ""purge"" (Oh man is it ever) so we'll just wait and see. Dark Circles is no longer an issue. Not sure if its cream or a combo of cream and massaging my face and getting the blood flowing around my eyes, either way, i'm freaking HAPPY.Didn't do anything for my pores but hey that wrinkle that I started seeing in between my eyes, has now gone.

Not as natural or ""organic"" as I thought!


I bought this due to the raving reviews and was super excited to try this product. I have been wanting an all-natural moisturizer without harmful things in it. I really did notice a difference in my fine lines and it does moisturize well to dry skin. However, I realized that there is Phenoxyethanol listed as an ingredient. I did some digging on the internet and typed if it was safe for the skin. Come to find out it says that it is actually very harmful and should not be absorbed through the skin. I was disappointed to find out that this ingredient was in a cream that's supposed to be NATURAL. I encourage you to read ALL of the listed ingredients before buying!!!

Fine lines, be gone!


Over the last several years I have revamped my skincare and makeup to be as natural and organic as possible. This meant throwing out thousands of dollars worth of stuff. No joke. Since then I try only to purchase products with ingredients that individually rate no higher than a 2 in the EWG database. This product, made by a chemist (I asked), is a great way to dip your toe into the retinol pool without the harshness, price, or side effects of retin-a. I put it on every night after my vitamin c serum and wake up looking fractionally better than the day before. I've been using it for months now and overall my skin is more even toned with fewer fine lines. I study every nook and cranny on my face with a mega magnifying lighted mirror, so trust me that I know there is a difference. Not only is there retinol in there, fairly high up in the ingredients list, but there are a host of other good-for-skin ingredients, too. There is only one ingredient I'd like to see them find a way to remove, and that is Phenoxyethanol (which gets a 4 on EWG). Thankfully, it is at the very bottom of the list, but it is the reason I removed a star (with hesitation). I'm eager to try other products by this smaller producer.

It didn't live up to my expectations


I'm bummed this actually have me blackheads rather than took them away. It also caused more breakouts. I've struggled with acne so I know sometimes it has to get worse before it gets better so I'm going to give it a few more weeks but man,  my cheeks are speckled with blackheads. The texture hasn't improved either. I have hard little bumps and acne scars. This hasn't improved them. Some reviews said they were contacted with usage instructions after purchase. I was not. I use it at night before bed and after I wash my face in the morning. If I know I'll be in the sun I won't use it. It does a decent job of moisturizing but it doesn't hold merrit to some of hype or claims. I am desperately searching for a natural way to clear my skin.

BE AWARE OF FAKE PRODUCT


I think I received a fake  LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream. I know that because I have used Retinol before and with this  percentage of retinol it would tingle when you apply it on your skin . This one does nothing, feels and smells like nothing. This is not my first time receiving fake products through Amazon. I regularly use Neutrogena Retinol cream I get from Walgreens and it works wonders. The last time I bought it from Amazon because it was cheaper, I could tell it is nothing like Neutrogena mositurizer . It was fake.

I'm mid 30s, sensitive skin, acne prone, and have my fair share of crows feet and forehead lines.I've used this for a month now and I like it.I use this along with the vitamin c serum, except I normally only use one every other day  due to my skin being sensitive. Some days I have used both and no problems, but I can't go too long using both without feeling irritation. I can't confirm or deny it helps with wrinkles, I really haven't noticed any difference, but it does moisturize my skin without irritation and hopefully with prolonged use it will prevent any future wrinkles.

Everything about this product is appealing: the packaging, ingredients, claims and reviews. It seemed like an easy and shockingly affordable win.

Any type of face cream, regardless of it's targeted benefits, should leave your skin feeling fresh, silky and touchable.  You should literally want to molest your own face.  That is not the case.  The product actually leaves my face feeling slightly stiff and tight.  I usually follow it up with some coconut oil or  Elizabeth Arden face cream so I can smile without cracking my face.  This product may work in reducing wrinkles, but there is no joy or satisfaction with using the product.

1 week and redness in skin lighter


Product soaks into skin, moisturizes,non greasy and in one week I‚Äôve noticed redness and dark spots much lighter. As for wrinkles I haven‚Äôt noticed a big change yet but it‚Äôs only been a week. I have purchased a second bottle to give the product a fair chance on wrinkles I‚Äôm sure they will take longer to address. I gave it 4 stars because until I see more results with time I can‚Äôt say it does everything thing it‚Äôs promised to do.I haven‚Äôt always taken care of my skin as I should to much sun because I love the outdoors.

Works well


Ok. So I‚Äôm going to write the best review I can based on my experience with this after using it for a few weeks. I should mention that I use this in combination with other facial products but added this to my routine in an attempt to help with cystic acne. I didn‚Äôt notice much of a smelll with it, which was fine with me. It‚Äôs oretty thick and a little goes a long way. Although it‚Äôs thick it seems to rub in quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave my face feeling greasy. The bottle suggests to use it every day unless you experience too much flaking or dryness. Well.... I can‚Äôt even use it every day. I used it for a few days straight and even with my other moisturizing day and night face creams, I still got dry, flaky skin. I could even tell where he cram hadn‚Äôt gone around my eyes due to the line of rough skin above my cheeks. I do use it about twice a week with no significant problems. My skin does get a bit flaky the day after use but not too bad (this is what retinol cream is supposed to do) and my skin doesn‚Äôt feel dry when used this way. It defiantly does what it‚Äôs supposed to. But if you have sensitive skin like my I‚Äôd take it easy on the application. I will but this again and recommend it to others, just be careful if you have very sensitive skin because it will dry it out and cause flaking even if you moisturize twice per day like I do.

Great product, great customer service, hopefully great results!


Been using this about three weeks, hoping to combat some age spots and sun damage from spending so much time driving and being outside, especially in the desert SW.Though I can't say with any certainty it is doing much yet, I sure like the way it rubs in and that a little seems to go a long way. The most impressive thing so far is that I was sent a great ""how to use"" page of helpful info ahead of delivery, along with a great follow-up or two after delivery. Nice touch, and goes a hell of a long way in making a favorable impression.I use it religiously last thing at night on a freshly rinsed face and first thing in the morning. Just a pea-sized dollop over forehead, each temple, and eyes. Followed before I go out for the day by Healthy Defense SPF30, as this Retinol Cream can increase sensitivity to the sun. Something I wouldn't have known without the great info sent. Have experienced no tingling, peeling, or other problems upon initial or continued use.At this point I think I'll document with images maybe once a week with the same lighting set-up, to better track progress, and will gladly update this review if I have anything additional to report.

Great for sensitive skin!


I am really impressed with this product. My skin gets irritated by nearly everything and I‚Äôve tried several retinol products in the past that caused redness, peeling, and irritation so I was thrilled that this one did its job without any of those side effects! I‚Äôm not sure why it hasn‚Äôt caused any irritation honestly because 2.5% is a pretty high amount of retinol compared to other over the counter products, but it could be the super hydration this stuff gives. It‚Äôs definitely like a night cream, but it hasn‚Äôt caused any acne or clogged pores for me even though I have large pores and oily skin. It‚Äôs improved my skin‚Äôs texture, glow, and blackheads in a matter of days and for a seriously reasonable price tag. I didn‚Äôt think I could tolerate retinol products at all and now I am so glad I took a chance on this one! Just make sure to use it only at night and wear SPF during the day! Your new baby skin will need the protection!

Good for acne scars and sensitive skin.


This has worked great on my acne scars. I have pretty significant scar tissue around my jaw because, even though everyone told me not to, I popped all of my pimples. Good news is they‚Äôre going away pretty quickly. There‚Äôs some other ingredients like willow bark which has salicylic acid and geranium oil which is good for facial aging. I had a stint trying to make my own skincare and I always prefer products where the first ingredient is aloe. It‚Äôs a pretty well rounded and effective product. I‚Äôve had a little bit of sensitivity and redness but it‚Äôs been pretty minor and I think it‚Äôs just part of the process with retinols.

Simple for someone who doesn't have a skincare routine


I recently noticed my face feeling more dry than usual, and I wanted to find something that could be a simple solution. I don't really have a skincare routine, but I don't really have too many problems with my skin. Since lockdown, I also don't wear a lot of makeup, so I felt like I should take this opportunity to start some sort of routine. This cream feels really nice and there is a light scent that is pleasant. I put this on at night before bed and wake up to soft skin. Looking in the mirror, I don't notice any big difference overall since using it for over a month, but I actually notice the difference in pictures. Overall, my skin has gotten a little more even, my freckles aren't as prominent, and it's helped with my genetically dark eye circles.

Spend the damn $20 and give yourself this gift


I have tried so many things Both affordable and expensive. I have taken oral anabiotic‚Äôs and have switched birth-controls back-and-forth. I suffer with acne as an adult that I never had when I was a young lady. Although I do look young thank you very much. I have four kiddos and in my 30s. I was really skeptical to buy this because I have spent so much money on different products but I went ahead and I bought it anyway. I said worst case scenario I will be in that koles return line in a jiffy. It Has been three weeks since I bought it and initially I noticed that I had more bumps. And here we are at week three and I have noticed NO NEW PIMPLES I still have scarring from my Old pimples ( don‚Äôt judge) Anyway do yourself a favor and buy it ! so creeping into the end of my third week into my fourth I would say that this last about a month I‚Äôm about to buy my second bottle I put it on in the morning and before bed. GOOD LUCK

Helps acne, but the bottle is misleading a bit.


I‚Äôve bought two bottles of the retinol cream as it‚Äôs helped my breakouts amazingly. It makes my skin soft and makes my acne smaller or even less painful. The people who sell this are amazing in regards to responses. If you have an issue, they take it seriously and do what it takes to make it right.However, my ONLY complaint is that the bottle isn‚Äôt actually a full bottle of retinol cream. It‚Äôs the top where the nozzle is. Take it off and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs just a little bit (as another customer pointed out). I love this cream, it‚Äôs amazing, but I feel a little bit disappointed that they make this in such a big bottle for only a tiny bit of product. If they‚Äôd change that I think a lot of people would be happier with their purchase ya know?Again, not trying to bash the sellers as the products are fantastic, but maybe just changing the bottle to something else to make it more of a happy purchase for customers would be better then feeling a bit mislead on the bottle and only getting a little bit for 17.

The BEST product for sensitive or acne prone skin.


I have been buying this product for at least a year now. I wanted to wait to write a review until I had used the product for a long time since, as I am sure you have found, some products work in the beginning but then begin to cause problems. I am in my mid-30s but still get occasional acne and hormonal breakouts. I have found all other Retinol creams to burn my skin, dry it out, and cause more acne to appear...even if I cut back my usage to a couple times a week (which defeats the purpose). This cream is gentle and luxurious. I use it every single night on my face and neck. I have had no breakouts and it has helped my skin to stay soft and helps to minimize my acne scaring over time. I get hyper-pigmentation which can take years to fade but this cream is very gentle and has helped to even out my skin. It has also worked great through the winter months here in the ""great white North"" as we are running furnaces and such constantly. It is NOT greasy, which I love. I like the pump canister that it comes in and I AM able to get the top off and scrape out every last bit which I like. The GIANT lid does make the product look larger than it is; but that is a minor observation. It is pricey but worth it. I have had times where I have used way too many different products on my face which only makes breakouts worse. I now just wash my face with pure organic honey at night and then put this cream on and then in the morning I wash with my honey again and put on a Korean sunscreen...and that is my entire routine. This product truly has been wonderful. This is coming from a person who cannot even use soap, lotions, or oils on my face without breaking out. I can use this every single day and my skin only gets better, little by little. I can even put this right up around my eyes and on my eyelids with zero sensitivity. Please do not EVER stop making this product and THANK YOU! FIVE STARS!!!

I use this wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin on my face before bed and the next morning I awaken with soft and plump skin that makes me look like I am glowing. Because the product does contain Retinol, be very careful about being in the sun üåû while using it regularly.This small company has wonderful customer service and has a algorithm in place to detect if a customer has purchased their product before on another website. This allows them to make your one on one with them a caring and personable experience! I will purchase their products again, because what woman doesn't like glowing skin with a personal touch! ?

I was suspect at first...


I didn't think this would work as well as it does! The first week using this i wasn't sold but i continued to use twice a day, and OMG my skin is damn near flawless! I have relativity good skins but from time to time i will get a deep deep zit that will take 3 weeks to come to a head. I have fair skin and even if i do not pick at my face i will be left with a red/brown scar that takes 8 plus months to fade. I want to find a before picture to show you the amazing-ness this product has down for my scars, they are barely visible now! i never wear makeup! it also have evened out my entire face so no more rosey cheeks! I will purchase as soon at i run out, unfortunately it is a pump bottle so i will not know i am out of product this it stops pumping the product out. It has a funky smell but i am not smell sensitive and i love the results, one it soaks into my face i add my usual moisturizer which neutralizes the smell

Not vegan


Bought this assuming it was vegan like their other creams, only to find out that it has propolis extract (from bees) in it.  I LOVE Lilyana Naturals, and wish they would take this ingredient out of their retinol product so vegans can reap the benefits of what it has to offer!

I was skeptical, but I really like this cream.


I ordered this product after seeing it mentioned in some ""Amazon cult favorites"" article.  Used it for a couple of days, said ""eh,"" and put it in a drawer.  I recently got it back out again, and after consistently using it for a couple of weeks, I can say that this is the first product I've used that has actually shown me visible results.  I have large pores and uneven skin tone, and both have a better appearance after using this product nightly.  Other products I had used to address those problems  left me with skin that was somehow flaky and oily at the same time.  I'm very happy with what I see so far with this LilyAna retinol cream moisturizer, and I plan to reorder when I'm out.

My 10 year old son gave me the best compliment :) said I look like a teenager OK that is a far stretch but hey I will take it!! one thing you can trust is what comes out of a kids mouth! but really I can't say enough about the whole line I am using the C serum and Eye Cream in the morning and the Retinal at night my face feels so soft and the Retinal was so easy on my face I never got red or peeled ! a tiny bit lighter on my sun spot but I have don't even think I have used this a whole month! The smell is very light to none on all of the products I have, that is a huge deal to me!! I have spent as much at $200 for 1 serum at the mall and this is just as good if not better, that one didn't change the spot so in that way better! ;) I just can't get over how much smoother my face is!!! I am touching it constantly and I know that is a no no but it hasn't felt this fab in a long time!!! I will be buying from this company again and for as long as I can remember I don't buy the same thing 2 times in a row EVER!!! So wish I would have taken a before and after, the difference is definitely noticeable!

No dryness, flaking, and peeling


I decided to try LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream after reading many positive reviews from a variety of sources.  I have tried more expensive products with the same active ingredients but was able to achieve better results LilyAna.  It has helped to reduce my wrinkles and dark undereye circles in a short period of time.  Most importantly, I received the benefits of a prescription strength Retin-A, but without side effects like dryness, flaking, and peeling.  I highly recommend this product.

Sensitive skin review: Effective but caused breakouts!


I have sensitive, oily, acne prone, unevenly textured skin. I got this restore the texture on my cheeks. I used this for about 1 week total. 3 days in, the breakouts happened and I'm still fighting with them now. This product really started to help with my uneven textured skin, not so much wrinkles, but the old acne scarring I have and my pores. Sadly, I will have to stop using it due to the breakouts, they're BAD. This product also doesn't absorb into the skin and it made my face a tad bit oilier than how it normally feels. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's skin isn't acne prone and sensitive.

5 stars for quality of the cream but low remarks for packaging. There is so much wasted plastic in the tall cap and unused space at the bottom of the container. 1.7 oz is a tiny amount of cream for such a big container. I understand the marketing tactic to fool customers into thinking your getting a better value but it's wasteful and bad for the environment. It's too bad because many manufacturers still do this.

Perfect starter retinol or retinol for sensitive skin


""Sensitive"" is a really nice way to describe my moody, irritable, angry, completely unpredictable skin. Everything makes it angry, and so when I started getting fine lines around my eyes, and my skin started to get dull I was really worried about how I was going to find a retinol that my skin wouldn't immediately reject.I heard good things about this product via an youtuber I like and I gave it a try, not expecting much.TL;DR - I LOVE IT. I noticed a difference within the first two weeks with the glowy quality to my skin; fine lines less pronounced.I've strayed a couple times, just to sow my wild oats, and literally any other retinol gets the typical angry burning tantrum from my skin. Most other retinol (and skin products) give me a sunburnt feeling. So back I ran to this product, and this time I'll stay faithful ;p

Not for me


I‚Äôm in my 40s with normal to oily skin and the occasional breakout around the start of my cycle. I do not have sensitive skin. I‚Äôve been using another OTC retinol and wanted to try this, as the reviews were good and the price sucked me in. I used this product one time and one time only. The next morning, I washed my face with my usual cleanser and noticed red patches on my cheeks that progressed to red, irritated, textured blotches as the day went on. By the end of the day, some of the places almost looked like chemical burns. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allergic to something in this product (I‚Äôve never experienced anything like this before), but this is not for me. My skin was clear and smooth before this. I‚Äôm so mad at myself. Lesson learned. Once my skin heals from this mess, I‚Äôll go back to what I had been using and was working just fine for me.

This stuff is magic


I am blown away for how great this product is..truly. I started using this August 31st and my skin has made many noticeable changes.  In two weeks my skin tone has evened out and my acne scars have faded significantly. These two things I have always struggled in correcting. I've even tried curology for a long period of time and all it did was burn my extremely sensitive skin even after several months of using it. Lowkey upset I dumped so much money in that stuff when I could've been using this magic. The cream moisturizes your skin and has caused no problems such as dryness or irriation for me which happens alot with other face creams. I'd give this a try before going out and buying expensive formulas. Side note: I do use the LilyAna Vit C serum morning and night with this face cream.

Love, love this! I've used retinol before at a higher price and it didn't work. Tried all types of facials and so on. Nothing seemed to work.So I was skeptical that this product would work.I was so Surprised!  It works great! It didn't take long for my skin to feel fantastic! No flakes, irritation. Skin just feels so much softer and smoother.I live in the desert where the skin is always so dry. This is a lifesaver!I've paired it with their Vitamin C serum and it's a double whammy. I use it in the morning (make sure you use sunscreen after) and night. You don't have to use a lot (follow the recommendations on the jars). A little goes a long way. Skin feels so much better. I've only used a short time and it seems to get better and better.And even better - no animal testing or animal products in it. So you can feel good about using.Customer Service is fantastic too. There was a very slight problem and they took care of it right away.

Best face cream I've used yet!


So, I'm a chronic dry and sensitive skin sufferer and the worst place to have it - on my face. There's just no way to cover it up and not look like a scaly mess. I'm not a dedicated makeup user, just a casual BB cream user, but I'd love to have a more moisturized complexion. My skin is also really sensitive and prone to breakouts which really limited the products I felt comfortable using. This is it! This is the product that helped me with my dry/sensitive skin issues. Since I started using it my face is more moisturized and my blemishes have cleared up. I wanted to wait a reasonable amount of time before reviewing but I feel comfortable saying that this is a great, GREAT face cream.

Great product and excellent customer service!


I stumbled upon LilyAna Vitamin C Serum and Retinol Cream when I was about to place an order for the expensive, name brand skin care products I've used for years.  After reading all the glowing reviews from satisfied customers, I decided to give it a try.  Wow!  The welcome email from Krista at LilyAna was a great personal touch, and she responded quickly to my response.  I've been using both products for about two weeks now and I'm starting to really see results.  As my skin has aged, sun damage and hormones have caused spots and deep whiteheads that won't budge.  Those are diminishing slowly but surely and I couldn't be happier.  Even my husband commented yesterday that my skin looked great.

There should be a warning that this product will give you huge bags under your eyes. I only used it on the wrinkles under my eyes and after a week or so the bags under my eyes were huge and very embarrassing. People would ask what was wrong with me? It took a few days after I stopped using to go away. Do not buy this product if you plan to use it under your eyes. No more wrinkles sure but wrinkles are better than giant bags.

I‚Äôd give more than 5 stars if I could!


This product has completely changed my skin and my skin care routine for the best. I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble in the past when trying Retinols with dryness and irritation, but I have not experienced anything besides for positive changes to my skin since I‚Äôve been using this. I used to have to use salicylic acid every day or other various peels multiple times a week or I would get clogged pores all over my jaw line, but since I‚Äôve started using this every night I have noticed that I no longer need to use my salicylic acid or any peel. I don‚Äôt get those annoying clogged pores at all anymore. This product has simplified my skincare routine and improved my results drastically. The texture and coloration of my skin has improved and I rarely get any breakouts now and I attribute it to using this product. I love it & I definitely recommend it.

This cream DOES work !


I have purchased expensive creams before, thinking that if it‚Äôs pricey, it must work right? That‚Äôs always been my thinking, with anything I buy.

I‚Äôm leery about recommending to friends but when I started getting compliments about how my skin looks radiant, I was encouraged!  First it was a close friend, then a family member I haven‚Äôt seen in awhile, then strangers asking me what my skin regimen is.. I told them and they said they‚Äôd try it.I am sold completely ! I have purchased this twice and almost done with my 2nd, so I will definitely buy again from Amazon !  Love it !

Amazing and Affordable


I will start by saying LOVE this retinol cream.My skin type: combination(oily and dry) and slightly sensitive. I‚Äôm 27, and seeing premature forehead wrinkles and uneven texture.I only use this retinol cream at night, as retinol can make skin extra sensitive to sun(SO USE SPF!). I only use this product about twice a week, a couple days spaced out due to the fact that my skin in a little sensitive. I noticed when I used this a few nights in a row, my skin would be irritated in some spots. This is a non-scented, creamy formula but not oily at all. Because it‚Äôs only 1oz, And I want my product to go a long way, I use an unscented face moisturizer, like cetaphil, before applying this product. It helps the retinol cream move around a little easier so you don‚Äôt have to use so much of it. This product helps my skin‚Äôs texture look and feel smooth overnight. Retinol is an exfoliant so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what‚Äôs responsible for that smooth texture. I‚Äôm giving it a 5 star rating as I recommend it to people that want anti-aging benefits in their skincare routine as well as those that have signs of aging already.

Radiant, Younger Skin


I‚Äôve wanted to purchase a product with retinol and I tend to try to use more natural ingredient products. I decided to give Lilyana Naturals Retinol a try. Just after about a week of using it my skin is looking more radiant, clearer and younger. I‚Äôve got combination skin still at 50 and sometimes may break out here and there too. This product has been great all over my face whether I‚Äôm using it on my acne, oily areas, dry areas or sunspots. It also gives me a more even tone and helps my skin glow! I‚Äôve had no bad reactions in anyway to it either. I highly recommend giving this Retinol cream a try!

BEST acne product


I have tried every possible product for acne. From drug store products to dermatologists. In my 10 years of fighting acne, this has been the best product I have ever bought - and all acne scars have faded dramatically. I use African Black Soap every morning and night. I only use the Retinol Cream at night because it is drying. In the morning I wash my face then use Rosehip Seed Oil and a moisturizer. At night, I wash and then apply a Vitamin C serum I bought at a local store, wait a couple of minutes then apply the Retinol Cream. My face has cleared up dramatically. When you first use the cream your face will definitely break out a bit, but that is a sign of purging. After that, it will all dry up quickly. I recommend this product to everyone and anyone!

Great for my red scared, acne prone skin!


I bought my first bottle of LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream in December 2017 and my bottle is almost out. I use it once a day (in the mornings with an SPF lotion/primer). A little goes a long way. I waited until I used the product for a while before writing this review as I'm pretty sceptical of new products, especially on my face, and from Amazon (sorry Amazon!). I do have acne prone skin so of course as soon as I changed my face routine, I started to see small break outs (this happens every time I change my facial products, but after a few weeks my skin will clear up if it's a good quality product). After using this cream for a little over 3 months I can say that I have noticed my red acne scars have faded, not a whole lot, but I can see a small difference. The cream is not thin and watery but not too thick either. It feels amazing and makes my face feel really silky. I have oily skin but this does not make my skin any more oily than it normally is. It doesn't dry my skin out around my eyes like other brands I have used. It really is a good quality product and I will be ordering my second bottle today. Glad I took a chance on this brand!

Natural Retinol Cream


This 2.5% retinol cream from natural beauty company LilyAna has a very smooth texture and is formulated with other great ingredients like hyaluronic, E, B5, shea butter and green tea. I have combination skin and it soaks in really nice without leaving a greasy feel.  My skin feels soft and did not dry me out at all after using overnight like some retinol products. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an anti aging routine on an affordable budget.

You can‚Äôt go wrong with this


I‚Äôve been using this cream for a little over a year now and I am so pleased with it. I am honestly shocked and so happy that a cream this inexpensive works so well. I bought it just to address the dryness and dullness starting to show up in my mid-40‚Äôs skin,  but it has improved issues I didn‚Äôt even think about, such as my dark spots. My face in the wintertime is so incredibly dry that I have had an extremely difficult time finding something that actually penetrated the dryness instead of making my skin greasy.  I found one product that worked but the price rose to over $200 a tube so I started looking for something else. I wanted something natural because my eyes are very sensitive and EVERYTHING makes them burn. This cream is awesome. No smells, very gentle, and it WORKS.

Non drying and works!


It looks like most people who are buying this cream are buying it either to remedy aging/dry skin or related to acne issues . I am of the first type. I have fair, combination skin and I'm early 40s. My primary goal was to help with some of the sunspots that had developed on my skin, particularly on the side of my face. My skin tends to get on the dry side especially in winter so I was looking for something that had retinol and wouldn't be as drying as some of serums out there. I have been really pleased with this cream. It has definitely reduced my sunspots and my skin is all one tone now. I do think it has assisted with some of the wrinkles around my eyes as well. I didn't have any acne issues before and I have not developed any from this  cream. I have bought this a couple of times now and I will continue to do so.

I have been using OBAGI for almost a year now and its been brutal to my face! I was constantly shedding. No seriously, I felt like a fricking lizard. Anyway, I was checking products out online (Because I couldn't take it anymore!) and noticed that LyliAna had some serious ratings and was organic! And, Okay, I'm not going to lie, I was excited about the price because I've been paying more than I care to on stuff that isn't very nice to my face!I literally have a butt ton of product under my sink from Oil of Old Lady's Regenerist, to Cindy Crawford's waste of money, to my last investment in OBAGI (Some plastic surgeon in Atlanta recommended it.) that is all most likely going to end up in the trash because I am 100% IN LOVE with this product!!!! I have oily T-zone acne prone skin and this product feels so light and flawless. I'm no longer red and peeling! No more rashes and bumps! I'm using the retinol and the face cream now. I'm definitely going to order the eye cream and whatever else they have in the near future!

Best thing I‚Äôve tried in a long time!


I am 44 and have fine lines and melasma which covers my cheeks, a few spots around my mouth and patches on my forehead. This product has made my skin so smooth visibly but also to the touch. My foundation glides onto my face. It has also broken up my melasma and lightened it a bit, which is more than I can say about a myriad of other products I have tried.I must say, however, that I returned the first bottle because the lotion had a horrible fishy smell. The second one was fine. Also, with retinols in general, your skin will looks worse before it gets better. Then about three weeks in, iI started to see improvement.  I have also been using the Kiehl‚Äôs scrub every other day which I think has helped make this product work better. Highly recommend it and you can‚Äôt best the price!

Good product, I really like it


I've been using it twice a day for two weeks. Too early to really tell if it will make a significant improvement to my age spots. I can say I'm not at all sensitive to it. The moisturizing effect is just right. It's very dense, the tiniest amount is quite adequate. I am not at all the type who spends big money on creams. I've tried a few and wasn't impressed enough to buy them again. I do think this cream is gradually evening out my skin tone and I'm encouraged enough to be diligent about following the directions. I wear O'Farrell cowgirl hats all the time now to 1. Not deal with my hair and 2. Keep the sun off my face without sunscreen. The jar only keeps fresh for a month I think, but I like it and will reorder again. I do not have dry skin, so it doesn't irritate my face. I use any extra on the back of my hands. I will be patient... give it six months because it's so easy to apply and I am a little optimistic that it will be effective over time.

Smells like fish


It seems like the product is working well on my skin but it has a terribly strong fish smell for about 15 minutes after application. I normally use a disposable cleansing wipe to clean my face before applying this moisturizer. I tried using just soap and water and it seemed like the fish smell was much less. I wonder if some ingredient in the cleansing wipe is reacting with this moisturizer to bring out the strong unpleasant smell.

Not a strong Retinol


I was very disappointed in this product. It might work well for people who are sensitive to retinoids but for me, it just wasn‚Äôt strong enough. I used the LilyAna Retinol Cream twice a day for 3 months and the only thing it did for me was moisturize my skin. I saw no actual change/improvement in my skin.  In years past I used prescription strength Retin-A (purchased from a Medi-Spa) so I know what retinol can do for the skin.  I‚Äôm in my late 40‚Äôs so I need a product that can penetrate deep enough into the skin to make an actual change.

One full month, zero results


Starting to think all these great reviews are purchased or manipulated with free merch. Because these products did nothing after a full 5 weeks of twice a day use. And I do not think there is retinol in it because products with retinol typically cause my skin to react initially. This did not. I used the vit c serum + day moisturizer during day, vit c + and retinol cream at night. 2 drugstore products actually have retinol in them with incredible results and have dermatologist medication. Going back to products that actually work & getting very frustrated with all the reviews lately that seem manipulated on amazon. Can't trust reviews anymore.

WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED - NEW FAN!


I'm in my mid-50s, have spent my whole life in the Southern California sun, and my face (and neck) have started to show it.  Sun spots, wrinkles around my eyes, mouth, forehead; tired-looking complexion.  I've tried so many products, including the expensive lines at the department stores.  THIS skin care line is the first one I've used where I can tell a definite, noticeable difference.  After washing my face & neck each morning and night, I am using the LilyAna Vitamin C Serum, followed by the Retinol, and the Face Cream.  My skin is glowing for the first time in years - my face seems to soak up the moisturizing, leaving it soft and not greasy at all.  The sun spots are noticeably lighter, my skin tone is more even, and the tired look in my complexion is much better.  It's also virtually eliminated blemishes on my face.  I had been seriously considering talking to my dermatologist about their much, much more expensive procedures, but the level of improvement I've seen in my complexion in the past two months makes that an option I can put off for now!

Made me break out.


Although many others have had success stories with this product, I did not experience the same results. I had been using Differin prior to purchasing this product, and it was successfully clearing up my skin, but I wanted to try a product that was both moisturizing and contained retinol in it. Upon application of this product, it felt very heavy on my skin (I have oily skin already) and just seemed to sit on my skin, not actually absorb. I began experiencing cystic and white head breakouts all over my face after using this product, and it‚Äôs disappointing, because it had taken FOREVER to achieve the clear complexion I had before using this product. I‚Äôm sad this didn‚Äôt work for me, but glad others are having a better experience with it.

For the skincare novice, this is an excellent product to try


When I ordered this product, I was just beginning my journey with skincare products. As I entered my 30's, I wanted a night cream that would be an overall general moisturizer with good quality at an affordable price. For that category, this product fits the bill perfectly. Since I ordered this product 18 months ago, I've learned that Retinol gives me some redness on my cheeks, and the texture is a bit waxy and the smell artificial, but overall this is an excellent product for someone who is brand new to skincare and doesn't know where to start. Since ordering this, I've learned that I prefer products with hyaluronic acid, collagen or Vitamin C over those with Retinol. Everyone's skin is different and it was the reviews that led me to order this product, so I don't think you should be dissuaded based on what I've just said. At the price point, this product is definitely worth a try. If it works well for you, excellent. If it doesn't, it won't hurt to throw it out or phase it out of your routine. As it stand right now, I've used it sporadically over 18 months and the product has just run out. I won't reorder it, but I'm grateful for it teaching me a lesson in skincare at an accessible level. For those starting out with skincare, I'd recommend applying this product after washing off makeup with micellar water, either applied on pads or in a wipe, then rinsing with cool water. I dry my face then apply the cream. In the morning, I wash my face again with cool water and spritz with rose water, then apply a hyaluronic acid toner, let absorb, and follow up with a collagen moisturizer, let absorb, then apply an overall glowing face primer before starting makeup. My skin has had less breakouts, less imperfections, and had more glow since I started using this cream. A perfect place to start for someone new to skincare. I knocked off two stars due to the chemical smell and the redness it can cause on my cheeks when used daily.

My face loves to drink this


I was looking for a new face lotion that didn't make my face so oily the next day. I stumbled across retinol creams and read a bunch of research regarding retinol and usage. I'm 28 years old and Asian so I don't have wrinkles... and I never will!! (I wish) I thought I'd try retinol to see if I can get that baby-butt smooth face again. I did a skin test as soon as I got the product. Put a small dab on my neck and side of my face close to my side burns. No redness the day after so I did a larger smudge the next day and was still ok. I wanted to wait a few months to give an accurate review of this. I got it in March and it's now June and my face has just been drinking this thing up. I apply at night after washing my face and brushing my teeth. Make sure your face is absolutely dry. I don't apply in the morning because retinol doesn't work well with sun exposure, but if you do make sure you wear some sunscreen or spf lotion with it. Half of a dime size pump is all I use for my face and then another half a dime size for my neck. A little goes a long way so it really makes this worth the price! I'll probably be ordering this again so that I look like a high school kid forever.

Very moisturizing - super soft skin!


I haven't seen any real difference after using it twice a day for 6-7 weeks, but it IS very moisturizing. Im 51 and having tons of changes to my skin lately (more dry, more breakouts, more fine smile lines). I bought it again because it makes my skin feel soft, and because I'm still hopefull it'll make a visible difference.ETA: over a year (almost 2? I'm about to turn 53) later I still use this regularly. I began using more expensive products (IT, StriVectin) and though I think some were more effective as far as wrinkles/brightening, this one gives me glowy, soft skin. I have a prescription for Retin-A (which did wonders, look into it!) but this is something I can use daily. My skin drinks it in and is at its softest on days I use it. Amazon history says this is bottle #7, that should tell you something!

High Hopes, No Results


Before detailing my experience, I will note I have combination oily/dry skin and long-time adult acne. I had not used retinol or retinol based products in the past.In reading the reviews, I was so excited to try this!! I read through carefully and understood results may not be instant and understood that a retinol may make things worse before better. However, in doing exactly as it detailed (I really wanted this to work!) I saw absolutely no difference. I as so disappointed.

Makes you look younger


Okay, I am 27 years old. I have always had stressful jobs and haven't always taken good care of my skin. A little more than a year ago my friend recommended that I invest in retinol cream after I noticed some aging marks on my neck and face. I spent a whole night comparing different products and decided to go with this one. The reviews looked more genuine. Well, I AM HOOKED. It makes your skin a little sensitive, so it is recommended to use it at night. I have added it to my skin care regimen (bc I have one now and it makes me feel special.) It is a wonderful moisturizer that I use nightly, it has repaired my skin and helped as a preventative for the future. My skin looks better that it has in years. People have noticed!

Fair price for great quality.


I‚Äôve tried a lot of retinol creams over the last few years and this one really ranks up there. I‚Äôm 33 and started noticing around 30 that my forehead was stinking quite a bit and I had a lot of lines around my eyes. I noticed a different in my complexion about a week after use. My skin feels the difference if I forget or skip my nightly routine. I always wash first, tone second, put a vitamin c serum on, and then put on this retinol. My husband said he noticed my skin was more even and my lines on my forehead were more subtle. Next step is maybe their eye cream and serum to see if it works just as well! I think the price is more than fair for the quality.

kin treatment + moisturizer together


I started buying this product after a trip to Paris. No, I did not find it in Paris, but was researching skincare that I was buying there (the French are much more interested in skincare than makeup!), and this product came up in my research here in the US. I've been using it at night only for about a year, and love it. I apply it first, then layer it with a heavy emollient night cream. Here's the crazy thing. I'm 40+, and have been plagued with adult acne for a couple of decades. After starting to use it (and making a few other skincare changes), I look decades younger but without the acne. OK, I probably don't look decades younger (lol), but I definitely don't have the acne any longer. I like that it is skin treatment + moisturizer together. I've not had any of the drying effects that you are warned about with retinol. Have repurchased several times.

I know my acne is hormonal and it's not easy to deal with


Where do I start with this cream?  I've been an acne sufferer since I got my period at 10 years old.  I've been diagnosed with PCOS, I know my acne is hormonal and it's not easy to deal with.  After having my second baby, my skin was doing great.  I knew I need a retinol product but didn't want to shell out massive bucks for the prescription strength cream so I decided to give this a shot.  WOW!!!!  I am so amazed at how well it works.  It's gentle enough that my commonly irritated spots don't get scaly and flake but it does the job.  People around have been commenting that I'm ""lookin great"" but they can't pinpoint what it is.  I think it's the fact that this cream has helped the texture of my skin, less breakouts, faster healing when I do get pimples, and less redness.  I'm happy!!!

You get what you pay for


This was just like putting body lotion on your face, I do not feel like this cream had much (if any) retinol in it whatsoever. I was optimistic about the price and glowing reviews, but this may be a you get what you pay for situation. I do appreciate that it really did not have a noticeable smell. I gave it 5 stars for the ""for sensitive skin category"" because this does not bother or even tingle your skin at all, which unfortunately only further indicates it probably does not have much retinol in it.

I highly recommend that you try these...will definitely be a repeat customer!Thank you!!!!UPDATE: I have been using this for some time now and really like it. I use this every night along with the rose day time cream. I am 59 years young and, to be perfectly honest, have not taken care of my skin properly. I would sunbathe using oil to get that ""California tan,"" work outside often without protection of any kind, never giving a thought to what I was doing to my skin. The past few years, I have tried the very expensive products that really tore up my skin and used other over the counter products. For years, I've had a dark spot on my face. Since using these products, it has faded to almost nothing! These products have my face feeling dewy soft.Being a small company, they are great with following up on your order.

Good for Rosacea


I really like this retinol product! It doesn't burn my face, it isn't greasy, it doesn't smell bad but most importantly, it definitely has helped clear my skin of pimples, evens the tone, soften scars, soften fine lines and instantly softens my skin. I do wait for about 10-20 minutes after I wash my face because my face is so sensitive. If you are in a hurry try a cool blow dryer before applying. I would also give it two solid weeks using it 1-2 times daily to start seeing results. It can have a purging effect as it brings the junk out of your skin so be patient and know it goes away.

I admit I don't wash my face everyday or moisturize everyday, but when I do, I now use this cream. It smells pleasant, absorbs well, and makes my skin feel soft and relaxed. The small bump eventually softened after about four weeks of non-daily use.I love the pump and how easy it works. It never clogs like other pumps so I haven't had any of those gross lotion goobers.The only thing that might make this cream even better for me is if it had built in sunscreen. I have to decide, as it's warming up, if I add a sunscreen or return to my old brand of facial moisturizer that has built in SPF protection.

Great for aging skin


Firstly, before you run away based on Bill's review, please do your own search on phenoxyethanol.  The EWG gives it a rating of 2, and considers it safe and non toxic.  Virtually every article I've read on that ingredient concurs that it is one of the safest preservatives on the market, particularly when compared to the alternatives (parabens).  So if you are truly concerned about that ingredient, take a bit of time to research it yourself.This product has made me look 5 years younger in just a month! I am 37 years old and just starting to get fine lines and wrinkles.  The texture of my skin has improved drastically since I started using using this.  I have also has acne basically my entire life.  That has been reduced to just one breakout on my jawline around that time of the month.  I wish Amazon had this available for subscribe and save, cause I am definitely stocking up so I never run out!

New daily product!


This has been my go to moisturizer! It has replaced my prescription retinA. There is no peeling or burning. Retina definitely helped get rid of my bumpy skin on my face but since I use makeup on a daily basis some bumps tend to come back. This cream has helped tremendously to keep my skin clear of bumps! There are only two flaws to this product. One is that you cannot see how close you are getting to the end. Right now I kid of guess it‚Äôs getting low since the bottle starts to weigh less. The second one is not knowing the exact amount/ percent of of retinol is used in this product. Besides that I love using this cream to keep my face clear.

PLEASE BUY THIS PRODUCT


I have never used a retinol before but have used lots of acids like AHA and BHA's on my skin so I would say I have decent tolerance for chemicals on my skin. That being said, I have mild rosacea and I can touch my skin and it will turn red so i guess its sensitive. Anyway, I bought this two weeks ago and have been using it twice a day... OH MY GOSH my skin already looks amazing. This product is so so so amazing and moisturizing (I think bc of the aloe which I love), I haven't had any irritation and i use this under my eyes and on my neck (along with the rest of my face obviously). My skin is glowy, no acne, some of the creases under my eyes are already gone. When I put this on my skin just drinks it up and gets all plump and moisturized. I love it!! I know that you dont see true results from retinol until months in but with amazing results just two weeks in... I love it!!

This is the last Retinol product I will try


Because it works so well! I have spent SO much money on Retinol products trying to find something that works.  I have normal/dry skin, am 52 years old and am always looking for something to fight those pesky creases, wrinkles and crows feet.  I have been using the Retinol and LilyAna Face Cream and my skin absolutely loves them! I no longer have congested dull looking skin.  The lines and creases have softened and are definitely less noticeable.  My skin has a nice glow to it (sounds corny, I know, but it's true).  My skin hasn't looked this nice in a very long time. And bonus-  a little goes a long way - which is good because you only get 1.7 oz in the bottle.  I just ordered the Vitamin C cream and can't wait to add this to my skin care regimen :)I have finally found a product that really works like it's supposed to and will definitely be buying this again..and again!

No difference


I purchased this product because of the really good reviews. I've been using it for months and I don't see any difference. I am 27 years old and I have fine lines around my eyes and some deeper wrinkles on my forehead. This cream did not make them less visible or anything. I think it doesn't do more than any other regular moisturizer. For the price I expected something much more. I am not buying it again.

Skin looks brighter, smoother after a month of use


Just passed the month mark of using the cream mostly only once a day. My skin is already brighter and smoother, even though I've had a very anxiety-ridden month. The cream absorbs well. I wanted to score this more than a 4 but not quite a 5 due to what other reviewers have said. My cream has a slightly fishy/ocean smell and a month in, I have two acne blemishes on my forehead. I've had bad acne since I was 12. I'm now 50, and besides multiple Accutane treatments, only a particular birth control has kept my skin clear of acne for any length of time. However, I am not concerned about the cream causing additional breakout. Any acne medication, retinol included, can make the skin worse for a month or so before it gets better. So I am sticking with this cream. Overall, I love it.

It‚Äôs a good product! It will do the job!


I am 35 Hispanic so my skin is fair, sensitive and prone to redness as well as freckles. Any touch of sun and my freckles become one! Lol. I‚Äôve learned to use the right system and love myself unconditionally will get me the best glowing skin.  I‚Äôve abandoned self care for about 2 years. Sooo I decided 6 months ago to start a new journey: I haven‚Äôt been completely honest I‚Äôve been binged as well. My skin looked warn and uneven. The lines forming near my eyes were tight and perhaps even crunchy looking. Call me crazy but time was tell-tailing on me: and I had to recuperate even if just a little. I started with facials. My new facial in a box is Advance clinicals 4 in1.  vitamin c exfoliation in the mornings are a must. Followed by the charcoal mask. Your skin will glooooowww! Then yes, beat an egg white as I do my morning chores. I let it settle all over my face as it hardens on my forehead, eyes, (upper and under) especially my cheeks and neck!! I follow it with a cold water wash and a tea tree or snail tissue mask. I sit and meditate for 10-15min. Lol. My retinol cream! And done! Ive learned today I should use sunscreen! So I am purchasing one now!:) I do this plus night routine. Lol. And depending on the day I like a good healing clay mask! They‚Äôre amazing for all skin concerns!

Misleading Packaging


I can't speak to a change in my skin due to this product alone because I've been making a lot of changes to my skincare routine. I would, however, probably not buy it again because 1.7 ounces ran out rather quickly with a once a day application for me. The bottle looks a bit misleading to me because of it's size, but you really only get a little bit of product. I was looking for Retinol cream and chose to buy this one based on the volume of customer reviews, but I don't remember reading about the size. As for the moisturizer itself, it felt nice on my face, but like I said, I haven't noticed a change!

Excellent & Affordable Retinol Cream


I absolutely love this retinol cream and the LilyAna Naturals brand!  I've been using this retinol cream for about nine months and the acne scarring on my cheeks has all but disappeared. My skin tone and texture are noticeably improved as well.This cream is thick and rich, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Unlike other retinol creams I have tried, the LilyAna one does not dry out my skin, and I am prone to dryness.  LilyAna will send you an email with instructions for easing into using this (applying every couple of days until your skin gets used to the product), and I followed them to a T and had no issues at all with dryness, redness, or any other side effect.  I use this at night after a gentle cleanser, toner, and the LilyAna Vitamin C serum. I have sensitive, combination skin that's prone to breakouts, but I have far fewer breakouts since adopting this skin care regimen.

Best retinol moisturizer ever!


This moisturizer has been amazing! I (33 Yr Female) started using this product over 5 months ago. I started seeing results in less than 3 weeks. I have always had uneven skin tone all my life but I was surprised how much better my skin started getting. It is so simple to use. Cleanse, tone and apply this. Thats it. Retinol products usually tend to dry the skin causing them to peel, so I was little concerned in the beginning. I started using them thrice a week in the night before sleep and then built up to use every night. I can't believe it. My skin looks so good now like how it was in my 20's. One bottle lasted me almost 5 months. It is so good that I came to write a review after ordering my next bottle. Thank you Lilyana Naturals for making this product! I wish I had found it sooner!

Best Anti-aging Retinol Cream


I like that this retinol cream is not harsh for my sensitive skin.  When I don't use it for a couple days, I notice a big difference.  This cream is soft and easy to apply, doesn't have the best scent but easy to over look once the cream dries.  Would definitely recommend.

Wanted to love it.... but didn't


This moisturizer is very nice for moisturizing.... and that's it.I like the feel of the cream when applied initially, the scent is non-offensive, and overall it was very good in that respect.However, I have been using the product for over a month and have not noticed any long term effects in improving the texture of my skin nor in improving the appearance of fine lines, if anything my fine lines look worse because for me the cream does not absorb well no matter how I apply it (fingertips, brush, etc.) and it ends up drying into a very flaky consistency on the most delicate parts of my skin around my eyes. I suppose I will be trying something else out.

This is a great product! I wish I would have discovered it ...


This is a great product! I wish I would have discovered it and other LilyAna Naturals products years ago. I am 62. I use this every other night on my face with LilyAna Vitamin C serum and everyday on the backs of my hands with Vitamin C serum too. Dark spots are becoming less noticeable on my face and hands. I have few on my face, but my hands have experienced more weather/outdoor exposure over many years. Until my mid-fifties I had moderately oily facial skin and would have used this daily, but now my skin is a little drier so I use it on alternate days. I like what I'm seeing and feeling so I don't want to use it more often yet.I am very happy with all of LilyAna Naturals products I have purchased.

My skin has dramatically improved and is much more even in color than before.


This worked just as well as other reviewers have mentioned.  I use it once daily in the AM, and sometime pair it with LilyAna Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  I have found that using both at the same time in the AM clogs my pores, but using LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream in the AM and LilyAna's Vitamin C Serum in the PM really makes a difference.  Even just using the Retinol Cream alone has made a difference for me when I use it daily.It has cleared up many of the dark spots which were very quickly invading the skin on my face.  Although the marks are still there, after using LilyAna's Retinol Cream for just a few months my skin has dramatically improved and is much more even in color than before.  It does cause some peeling, so I only use it once daily in the AM, and occasionally take a day off from use if the peeling becomes bothersome.

Thought this was supposed to make your skin better, not worse!


I'll admit, I bought into the hype and all of the (mostly) great reviews of this stuff. Having not had a skincare regimen for decades other than some Retin-A my mother MADE me use due to all of my sun exposure as a teen, I literally do nothing other than wash my face with soap in the shower before bed each night. I rarely ever have any acne (blessed with great skin I guess?) even when I sweat a lot or get really dirty working in the yard.BUT after using this product for a week, I have never seen such a bad breakout on my face, EVER! My face is bumpy and itchy. I'm getting pimples at an alarming rate. My skin feels so oily, even after washing it. At first, I thought maybe the product was just bringing stuff up to the surface but in the itch started in the past couple of days so I'm tossing this stuff and calling it a $22 lesson so stick with what works for me - nothing!

Start out SLOW!


For those with sensitive skin - this stuff is STRONG! Use very sparingly!For reference, I use this during the winter months only when the sun isn't strong outside. One time per week I use a pea-size amount and use a Q-tip to spread it around my eye and temple area, and on my smile lines. I also apply this more generously to my shoulders, neck, and decolletage. I apply at night before I go to bed. You MUST WEAR SUNSCREEN religiously, even on cloudy days! Commit to the sunscreen!I am young and don't have any lines yet, so I use this as a preventative method to keep my skin looking young. Even though I only use a teeny amount once a week, it really increases my skin sensitivity. You can easily ""burn"" yourself using too much. This is a high concentration of retinol, so don't hesitate to use a smaller dose when you're just starting out. Work your way up!I like this brand and will continue to use.

This is pretty amazing


Wow! I‚Äôm not about posting before and after photos, and it‚Äôs likely that my skin improvement represents recent experimentation with multiple products- so I‚Äôll restrain my review to text.I recently sampled a high end skin care line and while I was impressed at the results after using the product up- I was dismayed at what was being labeled a cheaper alternative to department store brands. In effort to duplicate the results in a more budget friendly way, I went seeking a retinal product with real incomes in mind. Enter LilyAna‚Äôs Retinal Cream Moisturizer.I am very impressed; not only with the product itself but customer service from the company.First- the packaging and pump are ample (lots of product in this little bottle) and dispenses a good amount per pump. (I use a half pump!) After using only twice (morning, evening) I saw a fresher, less lined face in the mirror. Again, I‚Äôve been experimenting with retinal for a few weeks- so while I assume the result is partly cumulative, I DIDNT see this kind of glow with the high end stuff (which by the way has a weird burnt rubber smell.)In fact, the total lack of any odor is my only slight gripe and that‚Äôs minimal. I‚Äôd rather have no smell than hot tires on my face any day, but I do like a clean, soft sent. Not a deal breaker.Customer service (via FB) has been prompt, friendly and thorough. They took the time to explain to me how their full skin care line could be used as a beauty regime, and explained that I could find a bundle with all the product for under $70.That‚Äôs still a bit out of my league at the moment- but is 30% less than what I was testing for the other folks. All in all, I HIGHLY recommend LilyAna‚Äôs retinal cream, and here‚Äôs to hoping I can win the full line, within their social media ad push.

Poorly formulated. Cheap packaging, no lot number or expiration (their PAO symbol is not a expiration date), Zip-lock bag, wrap-around labeling. Morning skin, worse then the night before. No benefits! It's takes a lot for me to go through the aggravation of returning a product (printing label, finding box, etc., etc.).; usually I'd just use it up on my legs or feet. My legs and feet deserve better. Don't waste your time purchasing this inferior product.

Pleasant moisturizer with no heaviness or breakouts experienced


I use this retinol cream moisturizer after Vitamin C serum as a repair & renew combo. I have normal combination skin that can breakout if products are too heavy or contain artificial colors, scents or PARABENS. This claims to not contain any of those. I was a bit confused tho by  description of ""2.5% Retinol by volume"" I was not sure if that meant 2.5% consistently throughout? OR 2.5% per the whole contained volume. Usually my face will flake if I use too much Retinol ...meaning consistently applied everyday with no breaks. I did use this everyday with no experience of flaking. So......I am inclined to think it is 2.5% per the volume of the container. I will look into finding a stronger one next purchase.

My Go-To Retinol/Best of the Best


Such a great retinol cream! I came across this as a suggestion from an influencer while I was barely getting into introducing retinol into my skincare routine. This was super gentle but effective! Im only 25 BUT I struggled with acne, scars, and uneven texture. After about 3 weeks I saw major improvement! By the end of the bottle I noticed my scars were fading and my skin was a lot smoother. I used this in conjunction with a vitamin c serum and sunscreen in the daytime and chemical exfoliants once or twice a week. At first I noticed some dry areas around my forehead which is normal when you‚Äôre first using retinol but I also think it had to do with me using too much exfoliants. I started to exfoliate a little less and use the retinol on DRY skin after moisturizer and the dryness went away. In the morning, my skin is brighter and baby smooth!!! I‚Äôve repurchased see real times, this is my go-to and I won‚Äôt stop buying until I decide to go with a stronger percentage. I can now walk out without makeup completely confident!!! Don‚Äôt use around eyes because retinol in general can cause dry eyes.

I Think I Might Love This Product


I‚Äôm pretty certain this is about to become a staple in my nightly routine. Due to extremely sensitive skin, I‚Äôve been following the 1-2-3 suggestion on StyleCaster (see below). So far, I‚Äôve yet to experience any redness or irritation. Since I‚Äôm taking my time integrating retinol into my routine, I haven‚Äôt noticed any big changes but my pores do appear smaller and I enjoy using the product. I plan to stick with it. When I‚Äôm using it nightly, I‚Äôll come back and update my review.1-2-3 Thing:For people with sensitive skin, A StyleCaster dermatologist recommended utilizing a 1-2-3 approach when starting a retinol-based product. The approach basically comes down to: ‚Äúuse once a week for one week, twice a week for two weeks, then three times a week for three weeks.‚Äù Then you work up to every other night and eventually nightly. Since skincare is a marathon - and I really don‚Äôt want to risk a breakout or peeling - this works for me.

I am sorry to say but another wrinkle cream that doesn't do what it promises.  I don't have deep wrinkles so thought this would work after reading the reviews.  I gave it a month twice a day but no change at all, and now the window to return is closed.  It takes at least a month to see if it makes a difference, i did decide to try because of the return policy as most of these so called wrinkle creams really do not live up to their promises, so if they offer the return then i thought perhaps they are very sure that their product will work.

Perfection Complexion!


I do use other products on my face, but usually only one at a time. I generally apply a Vitamin C Serum with hyaluronic acid before applying this moisturizer. But, I was using those products along before I purchased this. Now, that I have used the Retinol cream for over a month, I can see it is making a difference. My complexion is more even. The retinol helps rejuvenate the skin by causing it to exfoliate. This cream is great because it leaves the skin feeling perfectly moisturized (not over or under) and has just enough retinol to were it helps exfoliate dead skin cells a way where you‚Äôre not left with flaky dry skin. That‚Äôs why I call it a perfect level of moisture. It sloughs off dead skin but not too rapidly to where it‚Äôs visible to others. I wish the bottle was a little bigger - my only ‚Äúcomplaint.‚Äù

Great product, particularly if you are just starting on retinol. No scent, very creamy. My skin is very very dry right now (winter), so I didn‚Äôt find this to be as moisturizing as I had hoped, but it‚Äôll be great once the weather warms up. I would highly advise not using it around your eyes, as it caused mine to try out to the point of actual pain. Maybe because I didn‚Äôt add an additional moisturizer on top? Despite all this, I highly recommend this product. My personal skin issues are no reflection on the quality of the product. I use it daily, and it has really transformed my skin for the better!

It's giving my skin a little pick me up


I'll be hitting a bog 4-0 in a couple of weeks so I thought it was time to start using some anti-aging products. I've always had very youthful skin but adding this to my skin care has really given me a boost. I purchased this in the beginning of June and have had 9 and a half weeks of use. I didn't start to notice any changes up until about week 8.  My skin feels bouncier, healthier. My overall tone is fresher? I don't know how to describe it. I just look radiant. I've been needing less and less makeup to cover up uneven skin.  I have simi-sensitive skin and love that I haven't had any redness or drying.  I would buy again in a heartbeat.

Not enough retinol to help wrinkles. 0.025%


I used this since November and I had to exchange it, which was free as long as I return the last bottle because the cream started turning yellow. BUT the main reason why I'm doing this review is how it works. My pores looked much smaller and skin looked smooth, thats it. It did nothing for my wrinkles. I used it since November. It made me break out at first. I believe retinol works better as a serum and this retinol is a cream. The 2nd bottle, cream turned yellow again. The percentage is 0.025%. Which is nothing. This is something thats good for an introduction to retinol but not long term use. The main product that works for me is the vitamin c serum.

I've found the winning combo for the best skin ever!


After trying what feels like a million night creams, I have found the winning combo. I mix this retinol cream with maracuja oil and slather it on my face!! Tarte makes a maracuja oil that is far more expensive then going on amazon and purchasing the same thing from a different company. I mix these two at night, and when I wake up in the morning I can't believe how my skin feels. Every tiny bump that you can see in natural light and feel when you touch your face is gone. Dry patches, gone. My makeup is so so smooth now. I get so dry in winter and this is the best combo for me. I force my boyfriend to feel my face all of the time because I can't believe how soft it is. I've always had good skin, but this is a whole new level. Because both of these are so inexpensive I bring them down my neck and onto my chest and back of hands. I've noticed my fine lines are lighter. I'm all about this! You need to try!

Inconsistent batches, made my skin look much WORSE


I bought this product last year and used it sparingly, and I was happy with the results.  I wasn't expecting the moon, but my skin looked a little finer, slightly smaller pores, more glowy or polished.  I recently bought another one and it's a completely different product.  It now clogged my pores badly (I don't have this reaction to other products).  It ENLARGED my pores, and made the texture of my skin look really terrible.  I do not recommend this product.  It seems there is no quality control for this product.  Not worth the money as it's a gamble and the product I initially liked seems to be no more.

Gentle, doesn‚Äôt dry skin.


I‚Äôve always been wary of retinol because my skin dried up the couples times I‚Äôve tried it in the past. People say you need to keep using it to see the results, but I couldn‚Äôt get past the initial phase of dryness. But skincare influencer, Susan Yara (over a million views on You Tube for any of her most-viewed videos), highly recommended this retinol so I gave it a shot. It‚Äôs gentle and doesn‚Äôt dry skin. I use a good moisturizer after. Great for people adding retinol to their regimen for the first time or people with sensitive skin. Love this and will definitely purchase again.

Never ending breakouts.


Skin background: oily to combination/sensitive skin. Considering it‚Äôs natural, I gave it a try despite that I‚Äôm skeptic about retinol cream in general as I know it‚Äôs a make or break. True enough, caused me breakouts. I thought just purging, waited for a month to nothing. But they disappear easily, after a while though, more breakouts. It‚Äôs drying. This alone is never moisturizing, you‚Äôll need a good moisturizer. I actually applied every other day first. Where in fact, it‚Äôs suggested twice a day. Not for me I guess. Finding a good retinol is crucial.

Pros and cons: NOT for sensitive skin but it improves fine lines


SOME GOOD THINGS I'LL EXPLAIN... BUT I have sensitive skin, this cream causes me irritation, redness and some kind of reaction... I cannot use it on my whole face. BUT, GOOD THING IS I started using it in the C-zone (around my eyes, as eye cream) and it definitely improved my fine lines. Significantly. Unfortunately I cannot use it in the rest of my face because with sensitive skin, it causes me irritation... but as an eye line treatment: only cream I've used it works!!

I feel like this product really makes a difference! It‚Äôs the first retinol cream I‚Äôve bought and my fine lines look less. My skin soaks up the product quickly and I usually put my favorite facial lotion on top to lock it in. I‚Äôm 33 but I‚Äôve had fine lines since I can remember. This product reduces it and I‚Äôm happy that it‚Äôs a clean product. I will definitely buy again! Side note: I bought this product after reading the reviews and I didn‚Äôt receive any free merch.

I get a lot of whiteheads especially on my cheeks and chin and some scarring from when I was younger.  I started using this retinol cream along with the eye cream, and vitamin c serum and I think it's working great so far. I have sensitive skin and this feels really nice and doesn't irritate my skin at all. I keep mine in a skin care fridge so it doesn't go bad as quick.

but this product is AAAHHHHH MAZING  at 40 i developed skin issues even my esthetician was stuggling with.  since i had never had any type of issue, i was at a loss for what to do!  bumps lasting months at a time, thick, flaky skin, cystic acne, just a horror show each morning.  got this on tuesday and the dry bumps are disappearing, and everything else is starting to fade: dark spots, redness, i wish i could just swim in this stuff it makes my skin feel so moisturized!  i'm glad i read the reviews, as this HAS seemed to bring some things to the surface, as yesterday was rough, but today, its like my skin realized what a jerk it was being and started to get itself in line overnight!  def going to keep using this stuff!

Best face cream ever!


No scent which is great.  I have super sensitive skin allergic to all kinds of products but not this one.  I love it.  I have been using it for 4 months and my wrinkles have decreased by at least 60% or more.  People are starting to notice my skin which is awesome.  I also bought the Vitamin C Serum which I use first, then apply the retinol cream and then my foundation.  And then at night I just use the Serum and retinol cream after washing my face.  I just wish I had started younger.  I am over 70 and can't wait to see if more happens over the course of a year.  Bought it for my daughter and a friend.

Absolutely Great Product!  I'm a Repeat Customer -


I use this product every night before bed and after my serum.  Softens, moisturizes and brightens my skin.  Really doesn't have much of a noticeable scent, and has a light, smooth, creamy texture.  Spreads well and my skin is moisturized all night long.  Love that this has organic ingredients, is made in the USA and is not tested on animals.  It also states that it ""Contains no Parabens, SLS, SLES, Petroleum, Phthalates, Artificial Color or Artificial Fragrance"".  Label indicates that it ""Contains Retinol at 2.5% by volume"".  Very economical compared to other Retinol creams/lotions I priced on Amazon.  This is the second time I've purchased this product, and I plan to keep it as a permanent part of my skincare routine.  I just wish I would've found it sooner!

Glowing, luminous, lit-from-within skin!


I love this lotion! I‚Äôm not sure if the retinol is doing much for my skin as I‚Äôve only been using this for a week. However, I have noticed my makeup looks so much smoother, my skin appears more luminous and glowing, and my oily skin feels moisturized all day without becoming an oil slick by the afternoon (this is something I‚Äôve struggled with for years). I apply this lotion every morning, followed by a foundation with SPF 30.

I like this product


I like this product, but don't love it.  I've recently broken out pretty badly near the area where I've applied; can't definitively say it was the retinol cream since it wasn't in the exact area where I've been applying it, but it was very close in proximity and I haven't had the type of breakout before, so.....  That said, I would still recommend the product because I probably didn't follow the exact instructions which is important here, and because it works.  Plain and simple, it works.  It's working well on my dark spots, really clears up the skin and does wonders.  Just  ensure you really start slow.  All in all, very good product.

Works well at a good price


I use Lilyana Retinol cream on my forehead, crows feet and on the lines from my nose along the side of my mouth. I started 6 weeks ago. As someone else suggested, I started by using just a pea size amount every other day. I had no adverse reaction, so after 4 days,  I moved to everyday use. Again, no adverse reaction, so after another week, I  started to use it every morning and night. After a month, I was quite satisfied with the results. I decided to see how effective it is if I use the retinol cream at night and use my usual No7 serum in the same areas during the day. So far, I am very satisfied with this regimen.

Definitely worth a shot


I'm so happy with this purchase. I'm 33 but still battle with a face full of black heads and the occasional hormone induced Mt. Vesuvius. Retin-A treatments have always been my go-to. Tazarac has been effective but sometimes I don't know what's worse, the break out or the scales of flaky dry skin. I transitioned to a less harsh Retinol treatment, Adapalene, but it still required a prescription and could only be filled by a special mail order pharmacy. After doing some research I decided to give this product a try. I've only been using it for less than a month but I can see results. I'm going to give it more time before I give a final verdict (it might just be mind over matter) but I've definitely noticed a difference in pore size. Also I've been using it every night and haven't experienced any redness or dryness.

not crazy about the dispenser, but a good product


I like this product but I am not a fan of the container type which dispenses a little too much each time.  I feel like it won't last very long for me due to this and I don't like wiping excess on my body because let's face it, facial moisturizer is much more expensive than body cream...although this brand is very affordable.  I absolutely will buy LilyAna Naturals products again but personally prefer the rose & pomegranate face cream due to its lovely scent and screw-top jar for easier control when dispensing.  As for retinol, this is the first product containing retinol I have ever tried and honestly I don't see any big improvements in my skin.  I have pretty healthy combination (normal/oily) skin and a few fine lines at age 42.  I like this product but not over the moon about the retinol.

I'm not one to usually write product reviews, but I love this product so much I had to share! I take effort to take care of my skin. I visit a medspa monthly, and in turn buy ALOT of expensive, medical grade skincare. I've tried dozens of moisturizers, ranging from cheap to absolutely too expensive. Moisturizers have always underwhelmed me, feeling great going on but within an hour or two, my skin is textured and dry again. I have dry/combination skin. This stuff has AMAZED me! I put it on after washing my face at night, it absorbs so well, and my skin is just as soft and supple in the morning. Cannot recommend enough. Give it a try!

Stick with it - it's good stuff!


Ok, so this cream is a nice light weight and absorbs really well. Initially, I had purging with this, and so broke out quite a bit. I read that you have to continue use for at least 28 days for this to get better, and it did! These past few days my skin has looked clear, and my skin tone is much better. I only use this at night, as my skin is really sensitive. Then I use the VItamin C serum in the daytime. I have freckle prone skin with quite a bit of sun damage, and after about 28 days of use I am already seeing very positive results! Also, a great price as compared to all of the really expensive products I was trying before this one. Will definitely continue to use this!

excellent results


Being a male in my 50's it was rare to use much on my face besides shaving cream and moisturizer.  Along with relatively sensitive skin, I've never had great skin- past acne, lined forehead, wrinkles around eyes and mouth and large pores. The transformation over 30 / 45 days of use has been incredible.  Forehead lines and eye wrinkles are significantly diminished or gone and my pores are remarkably small.  My skin facial skin looks great and appearance is significantly younger.  My wife and friends have all remarked about a more healthy and youthful look - without knowing what my new secret is.  Also, while I did start a little light i had no issues with skin sensitivity.I am not one for writing glowing reviews but this is a must try for anyone in the market for a Retinol cream.

So far, so good for my dry skin and crepey neck


I have been pretty blessed to have really nice skin for most of my life. I am 38 and have very few wrinkles and rarely get acne. I had bariatric surgery in Feb and lost over 80lbs in just a few months. Whilst I now have to take a mix of daily vitamin supplements (including biotin) my skin had noticeably deteriorated. The area under my chin had become crepey from loss of fat deposits and I had developed dry patches on the sides of my face. I gave this product a try and after a month I could see a noticeable difference. I still have some crepey skin under the chin (also due to dehydration) but this product has firmed it up significantly. The dry patches on the side of my face are gone. I did have a slight reaction on my eye lids where it created a slight rash after a month of use so I will discontinue use on the lids (the skin there is pretty sensitive any way).

Great Starter to Retinols!


I love this product! It's a good starter retinol. It says it is 2.5% retinol but that is by volume the dose is about .025% retinol,  anything over 1% dose retinol has to be proscribed by a Doctor. It has good moisturizing ingredients so it's a good stand alone product and should be used with a good daily sunscreen. Retinols make the skin more sensitive to sun, so sunscreen is needed. It is a very high quality product, the first ingredient is Aloe and not distilled water, unlike most products, I appreciate the effort. I have seen some very good results in the month or so of use. I really hope they make a moisturizing cream with a stronger retinol thoe maybe a .50% or even a 1% dose retinol. I want to keep buying from this company but I would want something stronger in the future. Thank you for your quality products.

Repeat customer. A+++++ Product


Using daily for several weeks now on my very fair skin. The results are already highly noticeable. I have had zero irritation, the texture of my skin is smoother and fabulous already. I am HIGHLY picky about what I use on my skin, and LilyAna is the only brand I will use, after years of tossing out junk creams. The ingredients are as good as they come, non irritating, non waxy, and a perfect consistency that melts right into your skin leaving it soft and supple. I am applying their regular facial cream in the a.m. followed by this Retinol in the p.m., and the 2 work together wonderfully. I apply it 3 times a day, if i want to get a good peel on before a deep scrub - still no irritation. Customer service is top notch; will keep coming back!

Don't listen to propaganda.


I've been seeing a lot of posts that are trying to tear down good products, I'm not going to tell you not to listen to them. What I am going to tell you is that instead of reading them and assuming their right, do your research, realize that it's a load of bull, and buy your products that you want.ANYWAY. I have been using this product for a year now and it's not only protected my skin from wrinkling further along with the rest of my routine, but I've actually began to notice my skin has repaired itself to a degree. I used to be extremely self conscious of my forhead wrinkles. Now?

Great Product


I have waited to write a review until I used this product for a few weeks. I have been using LilyAna Vitamin C cream for a few months and it worked great for sun damage and a more even complexion. I then bought the retinol cream and under-eye cream, and its by far been the best beauty regime I have found for my face! I have sensitive dry skin, with sun damage, and its gotten worse since I moved to a drier desert climate. The combination has been wonderful. I used the Vitamin C serum twice a day. During the day I use the serum, followed by my facial sunscreen (La Roche Posay) and the retinal cream at night. I use the under-eye cream in the morning and night. For times when my skin is dry, I use the under-eye cream as an all-over face and neck moisturiser. The results have been great. I have fewer red patches and the overall evenness of my skin tone had improved, fewer lines around  my eyes, and its even given my skin a nice glow. The Vitamin C serum has helped reduce dark patches from skin damage. This combination has been one of the most effective I have tried, and its reasonably priced!When I first got the retinol cream, I used it only every-other day, alternating with the eye cream used a face moisturiser.

Great Moisturizer!


This is my second purchase and it's rare that I buy a product for a second time (especially skin care), as nothing really seems to live up to it's claim. While I can't say it reduces wrinkles (I don't really have any, even at 40), I certainly haven't noticed any new ones and I take antibiotics for acne, so I'm not sure how well this cream performs on it's own in terms of a clear complexion, but the retinol cream is a fantastic edition to my skincare routine. It soaks in seconds and it doesn't irritate my skin or clog pores. The cream makes my skin look smooth/even and since I don't wear foundation, this is a plus. One of the main reasons I love this product are the ingredients: the list is impressive and it tells me the company knows what it's doing. I will continue to purchase as long as they keep producing it!

Super nice product at first, but...


I first bought the retinol cream in Nov 17, together with vitamin c serum. I thought they worked great and my skin felt brighter and tighter every morning, after using them in the evening. I used the retinol cream every other night for 2 or  3 weeks and then switched to every night.  My skin was great, really. I ordered another batch to have it in Jan 18, after the holidays, and ordered also the face cream. So face cream mornings and serum and retinol cream evening as of aprox. mid january. The new retinol cream felt slightly different in texture than my other one, can not quite explan how, not as smooth and soft like having very fine sand in it. Also, the face cream was pretty much the same texture ( maybe this is how it supposed to be but thought is worth mentioning). Now, as I'm writing this review my face is full of breakouts on the sides, ugly red ones.  I must mention that i have no issues with breakouts other than a sporadic zit during my period. I always had a clear face so never minded the reviews quoting breakouts beacuse really, I don't have them.  So this is really odd for me. I first noticed this shortly after i've started the new batch but i said to myself maybe it will go away. Switched back to every other night. But it got worse. So now, i stopped using all the products as i dont know which one is causing it. I haven't changed any makeup so that can not be it.  I'm sad beacuse i really thought i've found my perfect regimen :(

works for me


I'm an older guy, just looking for a product that helps me stay looking dapper and fresh. I've never used a face product before in my life, so my review probably won't help much. I have not experienced any side effects like some people with sensitive skin, but this mug is pretty tough. My daughter says my face looks softer...not sure if that's a good thing for an old tough guy like me, but I'll take it as a compliment. No smell that I can tell, so that's also a good thing because I like smelling like cedar, bourbon and oak trees, not like pretty flowers. Overall seems like a good product. Think I'll buy again.

works!


I've had problems with finding something that actually works for my adult acne and mainly little blackheads. I wish I took before and after photos to prove it works.  It also works on fine lines aka wrinkles.  I use it morning and night, after about 2 weeks I started to notice no new breakouts.  A month later my face became so much more clear and rejuvenated.  I've been using this for 3 months now and just realized that the wrinkles on my forehead and fine lines under my eyes seriously diminished! My daughter started using this a month ago, she had bad red large acne, and it's gotten so much better since.  the redness and scaring lightened and skin softer that she asked me to get her another bottle before she runs out :) we both highly recommend!

Gentle and Effective


A bit drying in a couple areas but that's to be expected with retinol which helps with faster skin turnover.  Overall this appears to be a good addition to my skin regimen.  I'm not using it every day/night, but it does seem to be helping my complexion using it every other night or so. I've noticed a difference in my facial lines lessening and my neck looks a bit smoother too. I hope it works even better over time and when I can, I'll try using it every night.  I've been breaking out more just recently, and I'm not sure what's causing it.  I have super sensitive skin so it could be anything. I'm going to buy my second bottle and will update my review at a future time.

The real deal


I'm 33 and it has taken me this long to find a night cream that isn't so rich that it makes my sensitive, freckled, Scotch-Irish skin break out. This is AMAZING stuff. It goes on light, I love that it doesn't have a scent, I don't wake up with a greasy face, and I can't remember the last time I had a pimple (I used to get mild adult acne often enough to be a semi-constant.) The best part is that it really does help with milia, which is the entire reason I got it. One spot of milia went away entirely and it has diminished the appearance of the others - I hope to see more go away completely the more I use it! I'm on my second bottle and don't foresee switching brands any time soon.

I was very hopeful!


This LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream is packaged beautifully with a wonderful dispensing design. I was anxious to try it as I am approaching 30 and would like to keep my skin in good shape. After I first began using this (along with the LilyAna Face Cream) I broke out all over my face. I attributed it to traveling and my cycle and continued to use the products for two more weeks. My skin continued to get worse. It was the worst it‚Äôs been in a decade. It wasn‚Äôt until I stopped using these products that it finally started to clear. I‚Äôve never considered myself to have sensitive skin, but something in these products was too much for my skin to handle. I give two stars for packaging and the fact that I‚Äôm sure this would work for some!

Buy this product now!


I have tried so many products on my combination skin. I experience severely dry skin on my forehead and cheeks with some rosacea, and I have oily skin in my t-area. The first day I tried this product, I could feel the difference in my skin. I have Estee Lauder and Bare Minerals products I love, but nothing I have tried has been able to get rid of the dry skin on my face like this product does daily. I am definitely re-ordering and buying some for my mom too!

Been using the cream for a week, but I know results take time


I like the product so far but I can't say much about it because I've only been using it for a week. I love that the company cares about their product and customers and sent a PDF on how to effectively use their product. When I first received my package, I was surprised by how small the container was. I don't know why I expected it to be bigger, but that's my own fault. You don't need a lot of product to cover your face and a little goes a long way. I was worried about this product exacerbating my already oily skin due to the other ingredients, but I'm still oily as I was before so I it's definitely not the cream. I'll probably know in a month or 2 if this products helps with my face. But for the price that I got this cream for, it definitely wasn't a bad purchase.

It's a Retinol... Not bad


I am new to Retinol and wanted to find a good product to ease me into the retinol world, I went in knowing I will probably break out with the product so I used the cream 1x the first week, 2x the second and third week and now I'm on week four using 3x a week. Did I break out? Yes very minorly week one. Did it dry my skin out? Yes for the first 2 weeks. Now when I use the product (at night only) the next morning my skin feels tight and plump with no irrition. Reading other reviews this product got some hate for ""breaking out"" but you just need to slowly incorporate and get over the retinol hump. Mine took a month of using.

If You Want Retinol Then Don't Use This


I've used retinol for the last year and a few different products. I question if this even has any active retinol in it. Usually the retinol will dry your skin out a tad. Even my olay eye cream with retinol is a tad drying. I really wanted this to work - especially for the price. But I noticed no difference using this product. I have to question if it even has retinol or if it does the quality. Maybe it was degraded, either way save your money and go for another product.

Better Skin Already


Love this!! I got off accutane recently and was left with some spots of discoloration and this definitely seems to be helping out with it - slowly but surely. I like the consistency of the lotion a lot, it doesn‚Äôt soak into the skin immediately nor does it sit on the surface for too long. I use this both at night before I go to sleep and in the mornings before I apply makeup (I‚Äôve actually swapped out my primer with this) and I feel like my skin has definitely gotten noticeably better in the span of just a month. The container itself isn‚Äôt huge but one pump is plenty for my face so I feel like it‚Äôll last a long time, I‚Äôve purchased other LilyAna facial lotion in the past and it lasted much longer than I expected it to. Really, I‚Äôm happy with this! I have a ‚Äúnormal leaning dry‚Äù skin type and unless that changes I don‚Äôt see myself switching to anything other than this.

Great Product!


I just received my second bottle of this retinol cream.  I really feel like it has helped my skin appear clearer and brighter.  My hormonal acne seems to be better and improves much faster than it used to.  I noticed some fine lines around my face are not as severe.  One bottle lasted me around four months or longer with twice daily usage 90% of the time.  It is one of the few skincare products I feel has actually made a noticeable difference in my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this did not aggravate my face at all (although I did use it once a day for several days before trying it twice a day, just to be sure).  I've ordered the eye cream and face cream as well and can't wait to try those!

Loved Using - Noticeable Results!


I don't use many skincare products, but as I'm more than halfway through my thirties, I've heard many recommendations from women a decade or more ahead of me advocating for the early use of moisturizers, so when I came upon this cream, I decided to give it a try.I immediately loved how it made my skin feel softer and tighter and noticed after repeated usage that the lines that have already started forming on my forehead were greatly diminished, if not invisible. I will definitely continue using retinol in the future and recommend this product!

Been using for a year


I‚Äôve been using this product for a year now. I use it every other night. It is very moisturizing; I use it in place of a moisturizer. I have had allergic reactions to other skin care products before, but this one has never bothered my skin. I‚Äôm only 22, so I‚Äôm using this product as a preventative treatment, therefore I can‚Äôt speak to it showing much results in terms of winkles, as that doesn‚Äôt really apply to my case. But I think my skin looks happier the mornings after I use this product! When using this every other night, one bottle lasts me about 5 months.

Non greasy, quickly absorbed, no scent


I‚Äôve been using a very expensive face cream for decades, in which I have to buy separately a Day & Night Cream that runs over $100 each.  I‚Äôm in my mid 50‚Äôs with normal to dry skin, and starting to lose elasticity around the eye area, along with heavy dark circles.  Within using this cream for just 2 short weeks, I‚Äôve noticed major improvements with my problems, than what my regular creams has done for me in decades.  Hesitant upon using a retinol product as this is my first time, & heard that retinol can lead to sensitivity issues, I was pleased that I had no issues at all, and I live in Hawaii where we have intense sun most everyday. I use this morning & night.  Dark circles are lightening everyday, and my skin‚Äôs elasticity seems to be returning back as in my 20‚Äôs.  I also find that the moisture is retained throughout the day, and I can‚Äôt resist touching my face to feel how soft it is.  Very happy that the glow has returned too.  I‚Äôm so happy that I read about this product & gave it a try.  I no longer can go back to using my regular creams, and will now be making this my regular cream.  It‚Äôs also nice to get additional savings upon subscribing for repeat orders in which I will be doing from now on.  Thank you LilyAna for making me smile again when I look in the mirror!

Quenching for mature yet sensitive skin


I really love the LilyAna line. Sensitive skin people rejoice that this cream can help with fine lines without irritation. Retinol will always be an irritation to sensitive skin but this cream is the most gentle I've found while still being effective. First and foremost, it's moisturizing without feeling thick/heavy. I live in a dry climate in addition to having ""mature"" fine lines yet still have adult acne AND sensitive skin. It's a tricky combo.

After 2 yrs of use - 5 stars!


I am 61 with dry skin.  I bought this because I felt my skin was turning gray!  I thought I needed to speed up my cell regeneration!  I started out very slowly, using it only every other day, then every night.  I feel that is enough for me, because I do have to use a bit more moisturizer with it, and I think if I used it twice a day, it would dry me out too much.  I have been using it for about 10 weeks, and I have to say, my grayness is gone!  I feel I am quickly getting my rosy complexion back.  Also, my skin is very smooth and soft, and my freckles/age spots/redness all seem to be blending better together.  I will continue to use, as I am seeing results.  The price is phenomenal, compared to other retinol products I have seen.  Give it some time though -- great things don't happen overnight!  Update:  2 years later, I still use this Retinol cream.  It is great!!  I have had a couple of compliments on my skin lately - I believe it is due to this cream!

Results vary so start slowly with small amounts every other day


I have only been using this product for about 1 month now but I do like the results so far, my skin is not too oily and not too dry so it seems this is helping the moisture balance. I was able to start using this everyday with no irritation after a week. My skin looks better with the makeup on since I've been using this product. I imagine like everything else the results vary and how quickly someone see's results as well but this is a good start. I really appreciate their customer service support, they provided a product guide and even send communication to follow up on your progress. This is so unique in this industry today.

I would recommend this product for men


This is a great product for men. It helps decrease the deepness of your lines and eliminate some of them. It also evens out your skin color and makes it brighter. However if you have any skin cancer avoid putting this product on it. It made mine that was in mild condition break and bleed. I quit using it on that spot and everything was fine after that.

No need for foundation anymore!


I love this cream! I read in the reviews people don‚Äôt need to wear foundation anymore, I thought wow that would be nice but I was skeptical.

I wash my face with Humane face wash and I also use Humane toner, then I put this face cream on, morning and night. It‚Äôs cut down my morning routine time by a lot! Now all I do is brush my face with some powder and I‚Äôm done! Love it! I‚Äôm still on the same bottle, so it lasts awhile! Also I tend to get cystic acne on my chin.

71% Organic Retinol Cream


I was looking for a retinal cream that was affordable. Doing research on Amazon I came upon this LilyAna 71% Organic Retinol cream. The ingredients are for the most part plant-based. The smell is pleasant. Prior to my receiving my shipment, LilyAna emailed me directions for use which I have found helpful. I have used it as recommended for a few weeks now. The smell is pleasant and it has a creamy consistency. When I first used it I had an irritation on my nose from a clogged pore. After the first use I noticed the next morning minor flaking on that area of my nose, and that area of my nose has healed completely. I also noticed that the bags under my eyes were diminished after the first use (which is a plus). Other than that I've had no issues with the cream. I think I need to give it more time for all over results with fine facial lines. This is a very affordable product with a money back guarantee.

Good way to start your retinol regimen, lightweight yet very moisturizing, gentle on skin


I started using this cream on my forehead to erase fine lines and prevent lines between my brows. I would say it‚Äôs effective as I gradually noticed my skin improving. Then, I eventually started using it to my whole face and neck morning and night. This is a gentle moisturizer without scent. It calms my skin particularly after using a very strong retinol serum in the morning or retinol face oil at night. I don‚Äôt my my skin gets dry when using this, unlike other retinol products. I also like the packaging - pump style so the product stays fresh and uncontaminated. I re-purchased another bottle recently as I do not want to use any other face cream apart from this.My morning routine is retinol serum, then this retinol moisturizer, and finally a sunscreen. It‚Äôs light enough for this morning regimen. At night sometimes I use a retinol face oil alone, or the same retinol serum plus this face cream.  This moisturizer is gentle enough to put around my orbital lobe/eye area and I‚Äôve stopped using eye cream. I am overall pleased with my purchase. Thank you LilyAna team.

Best retinol product ever


We tried this product based on the ratings. We were initially concerned about using retinol products which can be quite irritating after a few applications. But not LilyAna‚Äôs retinol cream. No irritation and a thin application make this an easy product to use. After six months of use, my husband and I have noticed our age spots and acne scars, blackheads, pores, and fine lines have diminished significantly, and our skin is softer and smoother. Since such a small amount is used, you really get your money‚Äôs worth.

The only retinol to work with neck and under eyes


I have used so many different retinol products and they ALL made my skin red flaky and inflamed. My face would be painful. This product is completely different. I feel so moisturized after using it I hardly feel the need to use lotion on top. It makes me suspicious that this is even actual retinol because it is so gentle on my skin. I‚Äôve noticed evenness and brightness in my skin with just one bottle. My under eyes even respond well to it. My neck and under eyes pretty much reject every product I use, but not so with this one. Literally have found a gem.

This is Good Stuff


Started using this mixed with an under-eye cream because I'm 28 and recognized the time is now to start taking care of my skin better. I'd been using moisturizers off and on for a while.I now use this regularly, have for about a month, and my skin looks substantially better than it did. And I only use it once a day instead of twice. The first time I ever put it on it burned a little bit (which is normal) and that subsided. Slowly but surely, my skin cleared up, small wrinkles are a bit less noticeable, and I feel more confidently in my skin. I'll definitely buy more of this and keep using it. My girlfriend even started using it so we'll need to re-up sooner than later.Make sure you wear sunscreen when you go outside, though, just like it directs. Luckily its winter so the sun isn't too strong, but I have come inside after spending an hour or two outdoors in the morning after forgetting sunscreen with red skin which almost never happened to me before using this. We'll see what summer is like! If this just forces me to be more diligent about sunscreen usage (which is also essential skin care) then so be it.

Subtle difference


Subtle difference. I do feel like it's helped my skin look more youthful. It dries out my sensitive skin after use so I normally apply another moisturizer too to combat that. I think it's helped even my skin tone. I try to only use it on my neck and around eyes because it makes me break out when used around my mouth. I'm going to try other brands but I would could back to this one. In the photo the left is most recent and the right side is before.

Just ok


I was really excited to try this retinol facial moisturizer after reading all the great reviews, but after almost a year of using it, I doubt think I'll purchase again because I haven't really noticed a difference in the wrinkles or hyperpigmentation on my face. The moisturizer is light enough but I still feel a little oily after applying it in the mornings and evenings. In the mornings, I have to use powder to matte the oily look. I have very sensitive skin and will break out if I use new products, but my face didn't break out with this moisturizer. I liked that it didn't smell and has lasted almost a year now! Worth trying but not for me.

I really like the Retinol cream from this company.I received  it well packaged.It dispenses easily from the container .Easy to use full measured or partial pump.I dont recall any smell and if any it must be slight or none at all.The cream absorbs well and is effective. I know it was effective as spread everywhere as directed.I also choose to include my  lips After a couple of days my lips were feeling dry and tingly..So I knew it was working me for without usual side affects possible with Retinol use.I have had great follow up instructions of use from the Company that makes the product.They were also wanted to hear from me about how I liked the Retinol Cream.Unusual in this day and age.I willl buy more of their products.

Better than expensive brands!


Wow! Been doing a comparison between this product and more expensive but comparable  neutrogena cream. No comparison needed. This stuff is better, hands down!  It takes far less of this to do my face/neck than with the Neutrogena. And, the dispenser top delivers the right amount without me going back for more. Just the right amt for face and neck, plus a bit left over for my hands when done. Absolutely only possible criticism is that it was hard to get open the first time. The plastic protector round the pop-off cap just didn't want to come off. Other than that, best product I've ever used for softening, moisturizing, and minimizing fine lines and wrinkles!

Doesn't irritate sensitive skin.


I can't honestly say I notice a difference in how my skin looks, but I always seek retinol &/or AHA. It seems to be running out pretty quickly so I'll go back to another similar I tried. Also, when moisturizers have a pump, it is really hard to get the remaining cream out. Here is the other one I'm referring to: Anti Aging Cream For Face - Best Moisturizing... Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies. Another advantage of the latter is that it's a screw-top so no problem w/ getting every last expensive remainder. An excellent point on both of these is that neither irritate my dry, sensitive, redhead skin. A different brand I bought here had great texture but stung my skin, especially if your skin is too damp.

Good value and works great


I've had prescription retinol products in the past, so I've used some pretty strong stuff. I think this is up there in terms of effectiveness without the harsh drying I've received from prescription strength stuff. I use it to fade hyperpigmentation and acne scars and it's really been working well even after the first use. It's strong enough I don't use it every night because it does make your skin delicate and peel. I use it in conjunction with a retinol/glycolic peel I also got off Amazon (not at the same time, I just use both) and there's been no excessive irritation. My skin is looking great and it helps keep acne flairs down too.

This is the Good Stuff


I usually use Roc face lotion products, but those are very expensive. I found that I like this retinol face lotion better than Roc. It is lightweight and the scent is indiscernible. You only need to use the tiniest amount for your whole face and neck.

Allergic reaction on my face


I was excited to try on after seeing all these good reviews.  I only apply a thin layer at night.  The second night I used it, I feel hot on my face.  I thought it was because the weather was warm, but no.  After 30 minutes, my face was red and swollen.  I washed it off and place ice pack on my face.  The redness and swelling didn‚Äôt go away until 4 days later.  If you have sensitive skin, please test it before using it.  I am wondering if I can return it since it‚Äôs not suitable for all skin type as advertised.

I was sent an e-mail prior to the cream arriving explaining how to use it, I thought it was great.  I started using the cream as soon as it arrived, and nothing happened so I used it every day and still nothing.  I have used it for almost one month and I have not seen any change.

Made my skin break out...


I ultimately ended up returning this for the fact that it made my face break out terribly. I even tried to continue it for a week+ Using it at night before bed, thinking maybe my skin just needed to break out and then it would clear up, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. Had really high hopes based on all the great reviews, but it just wasn‚Äôt for me. It wasn‚Äôt a light cream, but wasn‚Äôt overly heavy, which was nice. Generic lotion scent. For reference, I have combination skin and can‚Äôt usually wear a face lotion during the day without it making my skin oily.

Glowing skin


I have slightly sensitive, really really oily skin, and occasional acne. I bought this because i have been trying to get rid if some acne scars from my teenage years. I have been using this for about 6 weeks and my face is *glowing*. It makes me so happy, my complexion has definitely improved and my skin is more creamy, like peach skin. I love it. The cream itself has a nice consistency, creamy and lightish, very very light smell, I use about one pump per night. I don‚Äôt use moisturizer on top of this.

I‚Äôve finally found one that works!


I‚Äôve struggled with very dry skin my whole life and have noticed in my early 40‚Äôs that it‚Äôs only gotten worse. I‚Äôve tried several face creams and have stuck with this one for a little over a year now. I keep going back to it because it works and I love the ingredients. It has a slight lovely fragrance and has never irritated my skin like others have. It also lasts long before having to reapply and keeps my skin supple. I highly recommend!

Great product!


I purchased this cream just because it was offered as a lighting deal and thought...why not!  Well I am certainly glad that I did.  I spend a great deal of time in the sun for my job and  liberal use of a sunscreen does not keep you from getting dark spots and skin like leather.  I have spent large sums of cash on products trying to find the one that works and am shocked that this economical product does the job.  It lightens those dark spots and minimizes the lines.  I even use it on my arms and the crepey skin and and leather texture is gone!  My only regret is that I didn't take a picture first! I just ordered more...

My favorite cream


Honestly, I have tried many, many different brands of facial creams throughout the years (I am 69 years old). I don't write many reviews unless I particularly find a product that I especially like.  This retinol cream (I am on my third bottle now) quickly became my ""go to"" face cream.  I reach for it every time even though I have several other products on my vanity.  It is great! My face seems to really love it and really seems to absorb it well. I have noticed some of my other (even more costly) creams seem to bead up on my face when I rub my face. I don't know how else to describe it but this product does not do that. Also, it makes my skin feel like it has been moisturized, which is especially nice because I have very dry, sensitive skin. This product is very nicely priced and works great. Highly recommend!

Age spot almost gone!


This product has not caused a reaction or a breakout. However, I used it for three days in a row and I began peeling not sure why I did that I have sensitive skin. Now I am using it a couple of times a week at night and that has helped. I am using a Cerave Vitamin C in the morning and this combo is making a difference. The texture feels much smoother already. And one of my age spots is almost gone. The other two are improving.

I am 34 and never had acne until my late 20s. I blame aging, birth control, and moving to a subtropical environment. I have been having a hard time healing and clearing breakouts and scaring for the past couple of years. I've been using this product for he past 1-2 weeks and I notice a difference every day. It's gentle and moisturizing at the same time. I'm looking forward to seeing the results over time and as of now, plan to continue using each night. I don't use anything with retinol during the day (even with sunscreen) because the UV index is typically 11 where I live and it doesn't mix well with retinol. At night I use this with a retinol serum before it.

Great product to provide rapid skin regeneration with skin clearing


Really does wonders , clinically proven to speed skin regeneration . You will notice your skin shed , that what you want to get rid of blemishes and pigmentation and acne marks etc.The skin sheds old skin faster then it normally would and regrows new skin w a max amount of retinol optically supplemented for better quality skin generation . Eliminates bad skin in some weeks or a month . If you have a lot of skin problems would integrate this in everyday life . Do not use in summer heat if you live in warm climate like myself in Texas . It will make your skin too sensitive and be counter productive . Otherwise amazing product

Jury is still out


So far the only thing I positively don't like about this is the dispenser.  When you push down it only dispenses the tiniest bit.  I'm not sure it will last a month, feels empty.  A little does go a long way, however it takes about 3-4 pumps to get enough on my finger in order to use (about half a dimes worth).  It comes out in almost a mousse texture.  Goes on light and dries almost immediately.  So far no issues with breakouts but I don't see any real line improvement either.

I'm hooked!


I was a little skeptical about buying this brand of product. I was influenced from a mom I follow on Instagram. I bought the set of retinal, eye cream and face cream. I've been using these products for the past two weeks and I can honestly see a difference in my skin! I have large pores and they have noticeably gotten smaller! My skin feels very smooth, bright and healthy. I am only 29 years old, so I didn't have many wrinkles to begin with, but I wanted to start early using products that didn't break the bank. I am blown away with how great my skin looks. The last couple days I have gone to work with no makeup on because I feel that confident in my skin now. I'm hooked.

Caused horrible breakout


I really wanted to like this product based on all of the great reviews, however after using it for about a week I broke out worse than I ever have had in my life. I have never had acne, just the occasional hormonal pimple. But this product left me with pimples all over,  and they continue to arise even when I stoped using it. The acne made my face feel hot, itchy, and flushed. I have not used this product in about a month since my horrific breakout and it is finally starting to calm down and go somewhat back to normal.

Reduced sun spots a ton


This cream is incredible for the price. After using every day for about 6 weeks, it significantly reduced sun spots that I've had a few years. Even without makeup, you can barely see them now. After a few more months, I'm sure they'll be gone.Only downside for me is that I feel like it breaks me out a little bit more. My face is a weird combination of oily and dry, so I don't use a ton of moisturizing products. This one isn't too heavy, but just enough to break me out in weird places, like sides of my forehead.I also haven't noticed any effects on fine lines, but that might just be a time factor.All in all though, it's worth it.

Great for oily skin that breaks out


Love this retinol moisturizer! I will purchase again. My skin has been breaking out on a regular basis recently and nothing I was doing seem to help much. I‚Äôve been using this moisturizer once in the evening and sometimes in the morning for three weeks and my skin has cleared up. Right now it seems like I have areas that appear flakey so I‚Äôve been using a scrub while in the shower to help with that side effect. By clear up I mean my skin is breaking out much less than it was but still does. I feel more confident in how my skin looks.

Finally, a winner!


I was hesitant to spend $20 on a small amount of moisturizer but saw so many people happy with it. My eyes are easily irritated by creams like Loreal, Olay, etc, but this cream did not cause any irritation at all. After the first application, my skin felt great. After a week of using it twice per day, my skin was noticeably smoother and always soft. After nearly 2 weeks of using it twice daily, the lines between my brows from where I squint at my computer all day are less noticable now. I'll definitely buy it again. Thanks!

My wife and I have both used this moisturizer at night and in the morning for the better part of 3 years now and it was my first amazon subscription, lol.I can definitely see a difference in my skin when I haven't used this moisturizer in a while; it gets duller and my complexion is uneven. This moisturizer pretty immediately brightens up my complexion and helps me look dewy without being oily.I apply a serum and let it dry for a minute or so before using this moisturizer.

My all time favorite skin cream


(Note: As an Amazon shopper, always be careful when you see a lot of reviews hitting in one time period. It means the vendor did some sort of promotion to encourage the reviews. Not a bad thing, and I stand by this product, but something to pay attention to when reading these.)This is the only product I have on a subscription via Amazon. Within days I remember seeing a difference in my skin. And now, after more than a year, there's no way I'd want to go without it. A cab driver demanded to see my driver's license when we talked about age - he didn't believe me when I said I was older than him.Of course, not all creams work for all people. I'm fortunate I found the perfect one for me - fewer lines, better skin tone, just all around better. I've used lots of very expensive stuff on my face - this has provided the most visible results with the least impact on my wallet.

Sadly, didn't work for me.


This product may be good for some people, but sadly it didn't work for me. I've been using this twice a day for one month. I thought I saw improvements for a day or two but other than that my face has constantly broken out. Not just one or two, like a face full of cyst-like pimples and also little tiny ones. I have been going to the dermatologist since age 13, and this seems to have undone everything! Will be returning to my prescription Epiduo to clear things up.I had high hopes about this product, and I was wishful in thinking it would clear my skin of acne scars so I wouldn't have to cover up with so much makeup. Instead, it brought back teenage acne. I don't think it's really to blame on the company, it just works for some people and didn't work for me.Sincerely, super sensitive skin.

I  tried using this retinol moisturizer for several months. I finally needed to just stop. It gave me cystic acne ALLLL over my cheeks, chin and forehead. A skincare nightmare. Typically, I have very little to no acne. I was only trying this product as a gentle anti-aging cream. I was sadly mistaken. BIG TIME! Im still left with SO MANY acne scars that Im slowly healing with aloe vera and Vit C. I cannot recommend this product  AT ALL and please heed my warning.

Natural, inexpensive, and WORKS WONDERS!


I stumbled upon this brand while searching for a natural moisturizer, gentle yet effective retinol, and doctor recommended ingredients. First I tried the eye cream and the facial moisturizer along with the vitamin C serum. I never used a serum before and i couldn't believe the difference it made in my skin. I'm almost 38 and starting to see some fine lines, uneven tone, and red areas. This really worked well and did not clog my pores or cause breakouts like almost every other brand I've tried. I just ordered the retinol and have been using it about a week, and my pores are already smaller. I am an RN in a dermatologist's office and these products contain everything she recommends and have nothing she says to stay away from. In fact, we sell products in the office that basically have all of these ingredients for a much more expensive price. Plus these have the added benefit of no artificial colors or fragrances. I'm out of my serum and just ran out of my facial moisturizer so I'm reordering those today. I've never been so happy with a skincare line before and I've never experienced such positive results. My patients compliment my skin and how young I look for my age nearly every day. Thanks to LilyAna Naturals!

This is an excellent Retinol Cream. I'm not ready for anything like Retin-A, so I get my vitamin A by way of a Retinol and this product delivers. It has a pleasant fragrance, very subtle and the product does what it says. I use it at night, but one pump does it for me. I had some tiny milia and after just a few weeks, this product helped slough off the skin to move those milia to a thing of the past.

Disappointing experience


I wanted to love this product. I liked how it initially made my skin feel; unfortunately, a few days after using it regularly, I started breaking out.  I haven't had a breakout in several years.  Thinking that maybe the stress of Covid-19 quarantines had something to do with it, I tried it again a few weeks after the original breakout occurred only to have the exact same thing happen again.  Unfortunately, it's just not a good fit for my skin type - your mileage may vary.

I wanted to like this one but it caused cystic type acne under the skin. The texture is a little on the ‚Äúwaxy‚Äù side so it‚Äôs probably a filler in there somewhere that clogs pores.I also found it very similar in both feel and packaging to another retinol product sold on Amazon (also from a brand that no one has ever heard of) and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the same formula is just made by one manufacturer and private labeled by several brands.

I have been trying all sorts of different creams to make my face look younger and smoother (expensive stuff too!).  I had skin on my forehead that no matter what I used, it always felt rough. After just a week of using this product, that old skin is gone and a new layer of skin exposed. It did exactly what it claimed. If you are like me and are used to rigorous facial treatments, this stuff shouldn't give you a problem. There was no redness or peeling with once daily use. Just gradually smoother skin.(I also use all the other Lilyana products with this and they work great. I recently added the vitamin c serum and my face is also brighter now too)

Overall I‚Äôm happy with this product. It doesn‚Äôt have any particular scent. It definitely has made my skin feeling softer and my complexion looking more even and smooth. However, after using it the first few nights, I started getting a rash on the skin just under my eyes. It went away after a few days of not using this, and some cortisol cream. So I just have to make sure the cream doesn‚Äôt touch the skin under eyes. Otherwise no other negative side effects so far.

It's softer, more supple, smoother. And no bags!! The skin all around my eyes has plumped out (in a good way) and I hardly need coverup any more! I was hoping to get these results in a month or two, but it's happened so quickly I can't believe it! Apparently, this is what my skin has been desperately needing!

First time retinol buyer


I have never purchased a retinol product before, but have purchased the eye and face creams by LilyAna in the past and loved them. I have noticed some aging in my skin and was looking to help brighten, tighten, and get rid of some age spots, and thought I‚Äôd give this a go since I liked their other products. I have applied it once since I only received it today, but so far, so good. I will update with more feedback in the future.

Great product at a reasonable price


As I've gotten older, I've kicked up my skin care.My wife pays 3x the cost of this product for creams with retinol - but my results have been great.Not in any way a gender specific product, this cream has no perfume smells - so it's great for men.A little goes a long way, and my skin is firmer, softer and looks much younger.I liked it so much that I ordered more products in the LilyAna line.

I love this stuff! Buy it! You won't be disappointed.


I have tried other retinol creams before, but I will never buy anything else for as long as this product is made. I love the fact the it is scent free (no harsh chemicals for fragrance). My acne purged for about 2 weeks when I first started using it, but then my skin started to drastically improve. It was so good that I set up an autoshipment so I never run out. Now I'm going to try their other products so I can ditch all of the more expensive skincare in my vanity drawer.

Stay clear of this if you have combination skin


After using this product a few nights a week for 2 weeks I started to notice my skin burning .  I even noticed my scalp starting to tingle and the hair around my face was starting to get a weird texture .  I swear this product made my fine lines even more visible. I saw this in one of Susan Yara‚Äôs videos so I thought  I could trust this product.  I highly DO NOT recommend this product.  When it comes to a retinol I believe it is worth the money to invest in a good one .

Y‚Äôall! This stuff is uhmazing! I never write reviews. In fact, this very well may be my first one which should tell you something. I‚Äôm 32. My skin has changed but I still have acne from time to time and combination skin. I was afraid this would be too much moisture but I guess my face needed it. Ive been using this for a week and I can‚Äôt remember the last time my face had this much color and vibrancy to it. My skin is already tightening, my acne scars have already started fading and I‚Äôm wearing less makeup. I found myself buying more makeup to cover all of these problems up but then I started using this. Y‚Äôall...trust me. This stuff is life changing. I‚Äôm super cheap and on a really tight budget but this isn‚Äôt too bad because a little dab will do you. I don‚Äôt use a whole pump and I still have PLENTY to do my face and my neck.

Amazing!!!!


My daughter has pretty significant acne that we use two prescription creams for.  She was going to summer camp and I didn‚Äôt want the hassle of sending those expensive prescription creams (one of them has to be refrigerated) with her to camp so I purchased this cream for her to use in place of them.  Since we didn‚Äôt get to experiment with it before she left I was unsure what her face would look like when we picked her up after a week of hot sweaty dirty summer camp mixed with bug spray and sunscreen.  Her face looked great and her forehead actually looked better than before she left.  She only used it at night since she didn‚Äôt have time to wash her face and apply every morning, but her face looks great, I may drop those prescription creams and switch to this full time!

I was dubious, but this really seems to work on my sun-damaged skin


I don't tend to leave reviews, but I've been happily surprised by this product's effectiveness, and I'm glad to share my experiences. After years and years of sun damage (far too many days spent outside in the Colorado sun), my skin looked much older than its years.After using this product daily for several months, I've noticed a definite reduction in discoloration and fine lines. During the winter, I absolutely need additional moisturizer, but that's not hard to achieve. And beware if you're out in the sun after using this - you'll be much more prone to burning, and you'll need a stronger sunscreen than you're probably used to using.

I love this product


I was reluctant to use any retinol product because of my sensitive skin, but I had heard such good things about this one, so I gave it a try. I've been using it for almost 5 months now and the difference in my skin - smile lines and crow's feet - is really remarkable. I cannot say that they've ALL gone away, because I'm 72 and of course aging cannot be erased, but when I was at the infusion clinic the other day (I have lupus and get monthly infusions to control it), the nurse was flabbergasted at my age: she thought I was 20 years younger! she said my skin was ""perfect"" - and I had absolutely no makeup on. I love this product!

MILIA REMEDY


I am still currently on my first bottle but let me say this.I bough this after recently after trying multiple products for milia over many years. From dermatologists recommendations to expensive face washed. Nothing worked. So for $20 I figured what is one more thing before getting them removed.Well this did it. The milia has significantly reduced and my skin is tighter. My chin area is a little sensitive to it so I just apply it to my cheeks, eyes and forehead. I also apply lotion afterward. I have pale sensitive skin.I will continue to purchase.Really like it.

On my third container!


I bought this as recommended off of a beauty review website. It got rave reviews. I am 46 with combination skin that is pretty sensitive. At first, it tingled a little. I used it every other day. I now use it twice a day. If I skip a day or two, I can tell easily, as my skin begins to look a little cloudy. When I do use it after skipping, I find the dead skin ROLLS off and comes off within minutes to an hour. This has become a regular part of my regimen, and I love it. It is far cheaper than some of the other fantastic performers out there. This is probably one of my items I would consider a necessarily skin care routine!

Good moisturizer, no evidence of wrinkle reduction


I waited to write the review until I had completely used up the container. I had no issues with drying. It was a very nice moisturizer. I saw no reduction in fine lines or wrinkles. No improvement in skin color or texture. No fading of age spots. Just moisturization. A nice night cream. I expected more from a retinol cream. Label says 2.5% retinol. I did not see any of the benefits that I would expect from retinol. Maybe it takes longer??

I love this product!!!


I needed to find a product that would help with the ""aging"" process.  As I am getting older I knew i needed to have an actual skin care routine.  I ordered this product because i saw it on a video by an ""influencer"" whom i watch.  I was skeptical.  I have very sensitive skin that is prone to getting burned, yes, actually burned by products made for sensitive skin.  This product not only did not burn me but i did not develop an allergic reaction to it.  It did not make my skin itch nor did it dry it out. I cannot smell anything.  NO SCENT!! That is fabulous!!.My skin is smoother, tighter,  I am more satisfied with the neck area. It helps with the ""turkey neck"" .  I would give this product 10 stars.  I am on my second bottle and the 3rd one is in the drawer.  BUY IT!! It is amazing.  I highly recommend using any product by LilyAna!!

I purchased this because of the stellar reviews not only on Amazon, but from a wonderful review from an online magazine review.

I can't say enough great things about this! I've never been good at caring for my skin and it was starting to show. I knew that I needed to do something and was about to fall trap to the R&F line. I decided that I'd try something more affordable before committing to something expensive. I've been using this Retinol Cream combined with the Face Cream- I don't know if it's a combo of both or one is better than the other, but the difference in my skin is amazing. It's taken away lines and added life back to my face. I'm hooked!!

If you are looking for a Retinol Cream that works, look no further. It took about 2 weeks for the cream to work.  I had the line between the eye brows and smile lines.  All have softened and are almost gone.  My neck looks better too. Since Retinol makes your skin sensitive,  I chose to use the Face Cream by the same company, LilyAna Naturals, in the morning, and use the Retinol Cream at night.  Friends have seen the difference.  I have regained my confidence, and now don't mind growing older.  I will be 60 this year.  I have been told I look around 48 -50.  I'll take it.Advice to all, start moisturizing in your 20's, and moisturize every day.  I am sold on the LilyAna Naturals brand.  Next I will try the eye cream, a very important product for a very important area.

I'll Never Use Another Brand!


I've gone through more face creams in my 58 years than I thought possible, and disliked them all -- too expensive, too greasy, too much fragrance, or just not effective.  I came across this after being dissatisfied with another Amazon highly rated cream. I'm glad I did!  It's light, fragrance-free, and absorbs quickly -- you're not going to have your hair dragging through it all day, nor will it leave grease patches on your pillow at night. It makes my face feel clean, healthy, supple, and less lined, and I've recommended it to all of my friends.  You won't be disappointed

It seems to be working so, I'm loving it


I've only been using this for a couple of weeks. But i like all 3 of this brand items I ordered. The Vitamin C serum which feels silky smooth, the Retinal Cream and the Face Cream. I was my face, use my toner, then put the Vitamin C serum. I let that dry the I put a thin layer of Retinal and finish with the Face Cream if it is night time. Daytime, I do the exact thing, except I continue on with makeup routine on top of the Face Cream. FYI,  I am copying and pasting this review for all 3 reviews.It is the way I use them all and I am actually keeping on schedule. Usually I do this type of treatment 2 or 3 times and I'm done.

It's the Good Stuff


Of course it's great!!!  I've always has pretty decent skin with the exceptions of dark puffy eyes at times and I've always seem to been dealing with annoying outbreaks of adult acne.I use it twice per day after washing my face.  I like how the dispenser is compact, making it easy for travel.  I like how one pump of the stuff is the perfect amount and that it's pretty much spot on a 1 month supply at 2 pumps per day.After just about a week or so, my skin was clearer than it had been for 10+ years.  I barely ever get pimples any more.  I'm still not immune, but I'd say its definitely reduced annoying pimples by at LEAST about 90%.  My skin also seems to have a much better complexion and smoothness to it.I'll probably never stop using this unless I find something similar for half the price.  I'd say give it a try!

Very Moisturizing and Smooth


I like to use this at night and have reordered it a few times. It doesn‚Äôt have a strong scent and it is very smooth and rich feeling but dries in a few minutes and leaves my skin silky instead of sticky.I can‚Äôt tell how strong the retinol in this product is, but that could be because of how moisturizing it is. Sometimes when my skin is more sensitive I can feel a tingling like with other retinol products, but most of the time I don‚Äôt. Sometimes I will alternate nights using this and using a retinol that would irritate my skin if used every night. Overall, it‚Äôs a very good moisturizer with a lot of highly soothing and moisturizing ingredients.

******Update after continued use for one week: I notice my complexion is a lot clearer so that remains a huge positive. However, sadly my skin became too dry after using it for a week. I am guessing my skin might be too sensitive for the retinol? Not sure but I have to return. The dryness was too severe.Original review: My skin was soft and clearer after one night of use. I have rosacea so a lot of products irritate my skin immediately but this moisturizer soothed it. I will keep using to see  other benefits.

It's the real deal!!


I've used prescription retinol in the past and this stuff is the real deal! The consistency is smooth and lotion-y and it absorbs well into the skin. There's no scent and I've even used it around my eyes (but not close enough to get into my eyes). I use it every other day because the skin on my nose tends to peel (my skin is temperamental). Other than the nose thing, it doesn't irritate my skin. My skin feels so smooth, fine lines look a little better and it helps keep little breakouts away. This is an extremely effective product for the price and I can't recommend it enough. Stop buying the drug store crap and order this now!

I can‚Äôt stop touching my face


I am a 49 year old fair-skinned redhead. I have been using the Retinol Cream in conjunction with the vitamin C serum for about 3 weeks.  I was looking for a high potency retinol cream that didn‚Äôt leave me with scaly red patches and tight dry skin.  I think I have found it. I started out using it twice a day and gave myself one small dry patch on my cheek after three days. I moved to using it just before bedtime and I‚Äôve had no more redness or sensitivity.The cream feels luxuriant, has virtually no odor and I wake up with happy, moisturized skin.  I have already seen a reduction in fine lines and a lightening of some hyper-pigmentation, but I have also been using the vitamin C serum and I‚Äôm not sure which product to credit. I‚Äôm excited to see how my skin looks in 6 weeks or so.  It honestly hasn‚Äôt felt this smooth and dewy in years.

If your one the fence... TRY. IT.


This face cream is the bomb. I am 37 and suddenly started experiencing constant breakouts and milia all across my cheeks. Probably a second round of puberty. Lucky me.Anyhow I decided to strip my skincare routine down to nothing and start from scratch. I started using African black soap and noticed a difference but still not the results I was looking for. Second step was this product. All I can say is WOW! I used it the first night after washing with the soap I used this moisturizer and then went to bed. The next morning I woke up not even remembering I tried a new product until I touched my face, I could tell an immediate difference. By the end of week 1 skin was noticeably clearer. By the end of the first bottle my skin was almost clear and the texture was very smooth, and my pores so much smaller.Working on my second bottle now, and I won‚Äôt be without one.

I was so excited about seeing my skin improvement that I then purchased the vitamin c serum.  I absolutely love these products!!  I am inconsistent when it comes to skin care and I lose interest when I don‚Äôt see a difference.  I‚Äôve been using my LilyAna products faithfully and I am so happy about my skin looking clear and smooth.  The retinol cream and vitamin c serum are the absolute best I‚Äôve found!!

Gentle retinol in a good moisturizer!


This is my first retinol product but my skin adjusted to it instantly - it's very gentle. That probably means it's not super strong, but my skin is definitely looking more even, so I think it's strong enough for me for now. I have oily skin so even at 35 years old my skin looks fairly young. It's a lot of moisture, perfect for a night moisturizer, but doesn't break me out at all. I'm really impressed with this product for the price.

Best moisturizer I've ever used


I was missing retinol in my routine, and as soon as I started using this my skin began to relax.  I wouldn't say I suffer from acne, but I do get blemishes monthly based on my cycle, etc.  I seem to be getting less blemishes, as well as faster turnover when one does sprout up.  It's thick and moisturizing without feeling like cake.

Great for sensitive skin!


My skin is worse than the princess and the pea anytime I try something new. My old skincare standby did a complete overhaul a couple years ago, and I've been adrift ever since. I had some stockpiled, but I'm running out, and this is the first product line I'll try. I've been using the retinol for a while, however, and I love it. It both helps my skin stay clear (I'm 37 but my face thinks I'm 15, and not in a good way), and more healthy-looking in general. No irritation whatsoever. It's fantastic.

Awesome product


I'm really glad that I found this on Amazon.  I rarely write reviews, but this product is the real deal.  I have sensitive skin, so I have to be really careful with the face products I use and this one has been perfect.  Right now, I'm only using it in the evening before bed with the Vitamin A serum.  Both products together have given my skin a healthy glow again.  I've only been using this since April, but the fine lines that have started to show by my eyes have already started to go away.  Keep in mind with this product and the Vitamin A serum that a little goes a long way!  Make sure to apply it well over your face, and it will last a long time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen as well since your face will be a little more sensitive to sun, especially if you're using it in the mornings.

Great product & excellent customer service!


I am 49 years old with increasingly sensitive skin. This cream is super gentle, no irritation whatsoever, even around my eyes. It goes on nicely, absorbs well & leaves my skin feeling soft, not sticky.  It is too soon to tell if it is making a difference on wrinkles & texture, but my 18 year old niece & a few coworkers have told me recently that my skin looks great (even without makeup).  Additionally, the company offers personalized service... Krista has emailed me, wanting to make sure I was happy with the product & making sure she assisted with any questions or concerns I have. I am pleased with the product & will definitely order again.

Works as well as it claims! Last PM step for your WHOLE face!


I WISH I had a before and after photos to testify to the awesomeness of this AMAZING cream! I bought it way back when, didn't ever get around to using it really, and now have used it every night! My skin is firmer, the pigmentation has decreased in the acne scars, and the overall tone is more healthy and even. Not red here, purpley spots there, etc. The fine lines in my forehead have decreased and I have to work a little harder to find my smile line. I LOVE that it is like total one stop too! You can use it on your eye area as well as face and neck. When bedtime comes, I'm ready to be DONE!

Get Glowing!


I bought this cream about 6 weeks ago and have been using progressively as the seller suggests in order to avoid irritating my skin. I'm 33, so my face is starting to show little signs of aging, but have a beautiful glow now and have received tons of compliments on my skin since I started using it.  Just ordered the eye cream as I ran out of my old brand. I plan to replace all my old products with ones from this line. I love supporting a small family business whose products are truly effective!

Worth every penny.


I love this stuff! I've always had combo skin, and troubles finding a cream that would help with that. I put this on every night after washing my face, and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. When I wake up in the morning, instead of being oily in certain areas of my face, my skin is even. This cream has definitely helped out with some acne issues, too. If I do have a blemish come up, it disappears much more quickly with the help of this retinol cream.I'm the type of person who hates to spend a lot of money on cosmetics or creams, but this is totally worth the money. And it's very reasonably priced compared to similar products out there. A bottle of this lasts me about 4 months. Buy it already!

Deceptive packaging!


I was wondering how/why I ran out so quickly, so I took apart the empty container & pump and low and behold... As shown in the photo, the smaller tub is found inside the larger bottle and that small tub is the only part that actually holds product. Still giving 4 stars because I noticed a lovely difference in my skin, but deceptive packaging is a major pet peeve and worth a star deduction in my opinion!

Love it.


I have been using this cream for 3 weeks. i started out every third night, then every night, and now im up to twice a day. i LOVE the feel of the cream, does not leave my face oily. goes well under makeup. ive had two small-ish breakouts and a small amount of peeling in two spots only. i should point out that this didn't happen until well into the second week. my breakout healed faster than usual. my skin tone and texture are improved. i have more of a glow when not wearing makeup, but it's probably just visible to me at this point.  i love this cream and i'll continue to use it. i just bought the vitamin c serum. :) i know it can take months to see the real results of this cream so i'm committed.

I‚Äôve had quite good results with this retinol! I use it both on my face and the back of my hands. My skin texture is slowly improving, along with fine lines. I use this on the back of my hands and I get compliments on my hands all the time (that might be weird, but I do!). The skin looks bright and new.  I love that this doubles as a moisturizer whereas many retinol products require you to use a moisturizer after. The packaging is obviously very cute and I have never noticed a scent.

Bad Experience


Yikes - if I could give zero stars, I would! I bought this along with the Vitamin C serum and the eye cream. I was using it once a day and within a few days of use, my skin was just peeling off. Make-up was clumping on my sloughing skin. If that wasn't bad enough, I then started to break out. I NEVER get pimples. Ever. Small pimples to start and now dealing with cystic ones. Absolute nightmare. I stopped using this immediately and went back to my tea tree oil and Vitamin E oil. After a week, my face is finally calming down and moisture has been restored, but I'll be dealing with dark spots and bumps for months. This definitely did not suit me well. I will be returning.

Lightweight but moisturizing!


I don't remember how I stumbled upon this specific moisturizer, but I was trying to find something to help firm up my neck.  I'm in my 30s and was hoping to find something that would help tighten things up.  This product definitely helped with the routine I had, and never felt greasy or oily after application.  It's lightweight, but moisturizing, without any noticeable scents or stings (which is exactly what I was hoping for).  Used 1x-2x a day (AM/PM) along with the rest of my routine, I can definitely say I noticed a difference in appearance and touch.  Would definitely recommend :)

It does at least some of what it promises to do.


Using it morning and evening, it lasted me exactly a month.  The pump dispenser is handy to determine the right amount to use each time.  I had no redness or flaking, but over the course of the month, within a week or two, I noticed improvement in the smooth and unblemished surface of my skin.  It also seems to glow in a healthy way.  I can't say there's been a lot of firming up of loose skin, but maybe I haven't noticed it as much.  Overall I'm pleased that it does seem to give the benefits it claims, and will continue to use it long term.

Update May.  Always need retinol peoples!


Update: after a solid 2 month of usage, just figured out this was what is breaking me out. Ugh. Contains some of the comedogenic ingredients that can do this. Finally found the culprit but apparently too late to return and get my money back!Still believe- Always need Retinol peoples! Moisturizing and use in combo with squalene  oil. No other moisturizer needed.

You are how old?!


The LilyAna Retinol cream is my absolute favorite skin care product. I have spent $100's of dollars on moisturizers and creams. Ultimately, I just end up breaking out and can feel most products sitting on my face. My skin is sensitive and for me it has been trial, error and a ton of money. One little bottle goes a long way. This cream is soft, silky and light. It leaves my skin glowing. I use this with vitamin C serum and I get tons of compliments. People can't believe that I am nearly 40. I can't believe that this product is under $20. Amazing! Thank you LilyAna!!

In LOVE


I am seriously in love with this product. I was nervous initially because it has a high percentage of retinol (2.5%) and many places recommend starting at a lower dose, such as 1%. I read many reviews and started out very cautious, as I wanted to reduce some unwanted effects that retinol may come with initially. I only used it 3ish times a week to start out, would use it following my toner and would wait 20 minutes before applying any additional products....like I said super cautious. I have been using this product for about 2 months now and have increased my use to twice a day most days. My skin looks great! My hyperpigmentation has been reduced, my skin texture feels better than it has in years and my acne is almost nonexistent (I do still get some hormonal acne on occasion). I recently forgot to use this product for about 5 days because I was working crazy hours and got lazy...within a couple of days, I noticed my skin was not what it had been when I was consistently using this product - I looked dull, noticed some new redness and developed a couple of zits.Seriously give this product a chance, even if you have sensitive skin (which I have!). Give it time. I know people expect instant results, but you won't see the full effects of retinol for about 6-12 months, so I repeat, GIVE IT TIME. Also if you feel cautious like I did, do research!Some advice for first-time users:1. Use about a pea size amount2. ""Blop"" it in dots around your face and start spreading from your forehead3. When you first start using, allow about 20 minutes of absorption before applying any other products4. Start off by using it about every other day (at night) and slowly increase to daily and then twice a day as your skin becomes for accustomed to it5. Trust the process...GIVE IT TIME.Nothing great comes with instant results. Even if you have some negative effects initially, this is expected with retinol. Your skin WILL look fabulous.

Great for adult acne prone skin


I started using this product based on the recommendation of a friend. I had started using a system from an MLM company and it destroyed my skin. I was getting acne worse than when I was a teenager 20 years ago. I wanted something simple, soothing, and safe. This lotion fit the bill. It feels very smooth going on and a little goes a long way. I still get acne before my period but it is more manageable and this lotion does not exacerbate the problem. I have gone through two bottles of this retinol face lotion and plan on continuing to use it in the future. Make sure you are applying sunscreen afterwards if you plan on going in the sun though.

Best I've tried!


I began using LilyAna face and eye cream the beginning of January 2017, I saw smoother skin, softer skin, my skin is sensitive but i had no reaction at all, and a few discolorations seemed less noticeable. I then tried the Vit C syrum, this really started helping dark eye circles and my skin just felt so good and healthy. Then I went on to the Retinol cream..this is something I thought would very possibly  irritate my skin, but I'm using it every night, even above and below my eyes, neck and chest area with no issues at all!  It takes very little of all these products to cover face, neck and chest. I love the eye cream alot, I barely dot it in and it's absorbed.  Excellent products that I'll continue to buy.

I tried this product after enjoying other LilyAna products. It has become my favorite. I have mature, sensitive, combination skin. It is very moisturizing yet absorbs into the skin within a few minutes. It is not drying or harsh to the skin. There is no smell which I appreciate. Compared to other lotions, this one is so very reasonable. I would pay more, but love that I don't have to.

It Works and a little goes a long way.


Is working as promised.  However I have never used this type of product or dispenser and I was over applying and used up more than I really needed.  Which is unfortunate when the product is a bit pricey for my budget. Take note, when it says don't apply to eye area...don't.  I did because I was just being to liberal with it to begin with...it actually caused some cracking and bleeding around my eyes...it healed, but it hurt....Lesson learned.  I will be purchasing more and I will be more judicious with it.

Overall, this is a good product. I have been using it for over a month now and do see the dark circles diminishing.

Super


It seems to cause break outs for me. Super bummed.Update: After I posted my comments this morning, customer service very quickly contacted me. The representative, Krista had suggested that it may purge the skin to clear it. (I purchased this a while back but just got around to reviewing) I tried it for a couple weeks but it wasn't a good fit for me. My skin is pretty sensitive so it may just be me. She offered me a full refund and I didn't even ask. I do think the product is very nice quality and it made my skin noticeably softer. I have the eye cream and I LOVE it and use it everyday. I would say the retinol is worth a try especially considering the amazing customer service. If you have any issues, they will certainly help. Thanks Krista!

This is my 4rh time purchasing this product and I love it. I have suffered from hormonal cystic acne since I was a teenager and although it has been mostly resolved at 29 years old (insert eyeroll here) my skin tone has remained a little uneven as well as my neck and chest began showing signs of aging due to sun exposure and the use harsh drying chemicals throughout the last 16 years.

Good product, overly complicated dispensing container


Bought this for my hands and face. I like it so far, but the container it came in was ridiculously difficult to open and dispense. My first attempt to flip open the little nozzle resulted in it breaking right off! After struggling to open it up further, I was faced with no less than 6 different plastic seals and inserts. Very frustrating! I would think a simple 2 piece bottom, and cap would've sufficed. That said, good product, not oily, absorbs well, no sticky residue, not very fragrant, but I kind of like that it's free of perfumes. I'll finish the container, and evaluate the results.

Which has left my skin with spots around my chin and mouth. My skin had become dull looking and I didn‚Äôt know what to do! I was use to wearing makeup as a choice but lately I was forced to wear makeup as a necessity because of the condition of my skin! This product used twice daily has done a 360 on my skin! My skin is glowing, dewy,bright and I do not have to wear makeup if I dont want to! This product will forever be in my skin regime!

Love this stuff!!!


I'm on my second container of this cream now and I really feel like it works! I also use the eye cream. The fine lines I was seeing aren't any worse and I think maybe they're a little better! I've also lost 60 pounds while using this cream and that made wrinkles the last time so I'd say the cream is making a huge difference!!

Forehead crevice begone!


This cream performed a miracle on my forehead! I was really unhappy with the fact that I already had 3 deep wrinkles in my forehead at only 26. Every picture I took, those wrinkles mocked me. I had tried other retinol creams but nothing managed to touch the Grand Canyon on my face until this one. I saw improvements in 2 weeks. I was so impressed! With a month they were visibly less and after several months they are barely noticeable. I don‚Äôt fret over them anymore. I don‚Äôt want to give anyone unrealistic expectations. I still have the wrinkles, but without dermatological intervention this is the best you can find!

Amazing skincare ESPECIALLY for the price!


I someone stumbled on this cream by accident and after reading the reviews I decided it was worth a short for less than $20.00! I had been spending hundreds of dollars on an organic skincare line that left me with total buyer's remorse and breakouts like I was a teen again. I have only been using Lilyana's natural retinol cream for a week and already see a positive difference in my skin. It is more even, supple (I hate that word!), showing less wrinkles, and breakouts are little to none! Plus you dont feel guilty using the correct amount since the price is absolutely reasonable!  Best kept secret that shouldn't be a secret, everyone should feel great about their skin. I would totally recommend!! I'm excited to try their full line (which incidentally is the same price as one container of my old brand, cha-ching!).

Used for 6 months & did nothing


I bought this along with the other 2 products (eye cream & vit c serum) from this company in June & have been using regularly since then. I use as the directions state. I have not noticed any bit of difference at all. The retinol cream is thick & kind of sticky. The smell isn‚Äôt great but it‚Äôs not horrible. I have acne prone skin that gets dry in spots in the winter. I have under eye dark circles & minimal fine lines. It helped with nothing. I wouldn‚Äôt buy any of the 3 products again.

The best retinol cream at a very low price!


I have been dealing with melasma and uneven tone for many years besides the usual wrinkles that come with aging. This cream is the best option at the best price to add to your skincare routine. I apply it sometimes in the morning and sometimes at night, depending on that day‚Äôs regime, two or three times a week. I have seen a lot of improvement on my face. The same results that I would get by using way more expensive creams. I usually try different brands and products to see what‚Äôs new and what could possible work better on me. However, this retinol cream has become a regular and it is goIng to stay with me for a long time.

Fine wrinkles vs deep ones.


Works? Definitely moisturizes and is gentle on the skin. I have a few deep wrinkles. I think I just had my fingers crossed ü§û for a miracle. It may be working on my fine ones, but I see myself everyday so I couldn't tell. Still use it as part of my ""night routine.""

I was really excited to try this cream. I have a pretty deep frown line on my forehead and I was hoping this cream would help. Unfortunately, I began to break out and I got some really nasty zits/pimples. I don't have acne prone skin so I immediately knew this was the cause for the. Changes in my skin. I was hoping for a miracle. It I just ended up like a teenager going through puberty.

Be careful with Retinol


After using this product for several months, my skin started to get red and look irritated. I looked online and found that retinol can cause this reaction. I signed up for automatic delivery of the product but found it very hard to cancel. I got several deliveries that I had to return before I could find out how to cancel. What I liked was the bottle with the pump top. All the product could be used.

Fantastic!


I have sensitive skin and haven‚Äôt been able to use retinol in the past due to extreme peeling that didn‚Äôt get better with an adjustment period/only using at night/alternating days/etc.  The only side affect I‚Äôve had from this was a tiny bit of stinging the first few times, but nothing that would keep me from using it.

Takes some time getting used to, but great product


I have sensitive skin, so this really dried it out at first - I had to gradually build up my usage and I even stopped for a day or two and restarted. It was worth it, though, because now I can use it every day without a problem, and there are clear and noticeable results. My skin looks more firm. I'll definitely be reordering.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to give this retinol cream a try because my skin was looking dull and blotchy. I often have to use a light weight moisturizer due to acne. I was hoping it would even out my skin tone, but it went a step further and had really helped control the summer sweat acne that has always plagued me. My skin feels moisturized, smooth, and healthy.

My #1 moisturizer


I have went through many moisturizers to try to find the best one. This has to be around my 6th or 7th that Ive tried. I have sensitive skin, and dry skin in the winter. This moisturizer is BY FAR the best one Ive used, so much so that I am now buying it for the second time. It doesnt leave an oily feeling, and my face is never dry after using for the whole day. The only downside is the size of it, it is rather small, but that is common in face moisturizers. Love this one!!

Just okay for me. Nothing to rave about.


I feel like the ""odd man out"" as I read all the rave reviews and was really expecting to notice results from this. I have been using it for quite a while now and started out just at night and worked up to using morning and night. I did not experience any irritation from using the product so that is a plus but also have not noticed any difference in my skin at all. I like the feel of the product and it goes on nicely but can't really get on board and rave about this product. It is just okay and I will probably finish using it up but don't plan on buying it again.

Not for sensitive skin


I used this about a week and began to breakout. I've used other retinol products in the past that never broke me out. (last year) However, I also noticed there is cetyl alcohol in this product which isn't really good for your skin. This product is just ok but I don't recommend it for people with sensitive skin like me. It's great for moisturizing if you have dry skin, but if your skin is oily like mine use a VERY small amount only at night and follow up with a good sunscreen in the mornings, the higher the SPF, the better.

Super Gentle


This retinol cream is awesome. I have super sensitive skin and have no problems with it. There is no scent whichis how it should be with facial skin products. What is great about this product is I am able to put it on my eyelidand directly under my eyes, which many creams warn against. However, this cream is super gentle and I continue topurchase because I do not have a reaction to it.

Overall- This is a good buy. I gave this product a 4 star because it‚Äôs a little bit thicker than I prefer and it doesn‚Äôt have a special scent(no scent).

As an acne sufferer and now woman in my late 30‚Äôs, it‚Äôs important for me to find moisturizing creams and retinols that do not irritate my skin. I‚Äôve tried lots. I was also searching for something that was safer on my skin throughout my pregnancy. This product really delivered. Within a few days, there was a noticeable difference in texture and redness. I like the plump fresh feeling I get from it and my skin looks great in the mornings. The price, packaging, quality, and volume of product makes this my ultimate go.

My skin had a horrible reaction


I had great success using a much more expensive product line but in an attempt to save money I came to Amazon seeking a product with great reviews.  Being an experienced retinol user, I know that there is always a purge period during the first few weeks/month but this product caused my skin to have a horrible reaction.  I endured two months of horrible breakouts, red patches and dryness before I gave up and realized there was something horribly wrong.  I have been off of the product for 2 weeks now and my skin, although better, is still pretty bad.  Beware if you have sensitive skin or have a low tolerance for retinol, this is stronger than it leads you to believe in the description.

it works ok but smells terrible


It's fine as a moisturizer. I have used better and worse. It's pretty average in that department and I wasn't even going to bother to review this but... it's smells terribly. Maybe I have a one off but it reeks. I often read reviews that mention bad smells and I usually have no idea what the review means because it smells ok to be but this smells bad! The smell fades after a few minutes but when applying it is bad. It does get rid of my flaky patches and it's not greasy at all.

FOREVER CUSTOMER


IM NOW A FOREVER CUSTOMER.Things I was suffering from before I started using this cream-*dermatitis*melasma*uneven skin tone*mild acne  After about a month of using this cream religiously, I noticed a significant change in my facial skin. I've had melasma for about a year. This cream is slowly but surely making the embarrassing ""melasma mustache"" as I like to call it disappear. I'm thankful I didn't have to use a bleaching solution to do the job.  I have not had an acne breakout since I started using it. I usually have the ""hormonal"" outbreak which I previously thought there was no solution for. Well, with this cream I haven't had a break out since the first use.  My dermatitis has cleared up. I no longer have red blotches on my nose and chin region. I also noticed my skin looks younger, smoother and more radiant. It made my skin look like I drink fifteen glasses of water a day. I wish I had a large tube I could apply to my entire body. This is the only facial cream I've loved, noticed a significant difference, and I am now a forever fan. Highly recommended it!!!

Not greasy, not noticeably improving skin


One pump covers my neck and collar bone/upper chest area. Regarding effectiveness, I never had dry skin to begin with but I'm in my mid 30s and was urged to begin a neck cream regimen. I would prefer better skin retraction (I have submental fat in the neck area I'm trying to reduce), so this may not be the product I settle on. Glides on well, not greasy.

I was Hoping for Better


I had very high hopes for this product. Before trying this product I got to test out a new product coming out in the near future. The new product is an all natural retinol cream and it was my first time ever trying retinol. I loved the product it. It did wonders for my face. Fine lines gone. Acne gone. Dark spots gone. But I ran out of the product and I needed to try something else and I decided to try LilyAna Retinol Cream it is very moisturizing, but it is not doing the same wonders for my skin as the other cream. After trying it for 2 weeks my acne is back. I guess back to the hunt of finding a cream that works as good til the other one comes out.

Caused Severe Acne


I have acne scaring, melasma, and hyperpigmentation. This cream is moisturizing, the scent is fine and it did not irritate my skin too much (outside of what is considerably normal for anything containing retinol). However, this cream did cause break outs (which left more scaring) well after the ‚Äúpurging‚Äù period that is typical. I finally went to the dermatologist and got a prescription retinol so I no longer had use for this (I would have discontinued anyway because it caused me to have the worst break out that I have had of my adult life).

Great for sensitive face!


I use this with this with the Vitamin C Serum. I use half a pump of retinol, and it covers my face with a thin layer. I noticed a difference in the touch of my face the morning after I applied this one - super soft! After a week of using this every other night, I've noticed less redness, acne, and oil on my face. After applying the Retinol, I wait at least 3-5 minutes, and then apply face sunscreen (Mary Kay - SPF 35), then apply face lotion as my daily regimen. If you need a soap for sensitive skin, I suggest the Charcoal Lavender Essential Oil Soap Bar. I use this for my face and body.

Great Retinol Product for Sensitive Skin!


Started out with this product once a week for two weeks, then twice a week for the next two.  I am now using three nights on and one night off.  Only took a few weeks to see results but I can definitely, two months in, see multiple changes and improvement to my fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, and discoloration.  Because my skin is very sensitive, I was hesitant to use a Retinol product of any kind.  I know the benefits are substantial but jumping right in to a prescription Retin A, like Tretinoin, was the wrong move for my skin.  For me, it will be a fantastic way to ease in to a prescription product.  Experienced no breakouts or irritation at all.  I use a moisturizing cream after the Retinol Cream.  So far, so great!

The only moisturizer I use.


I first ordered this product in August of 2017 and have been so pleased, that I have been a loyal customer ever since: I don't use any other moisturizer or lotion on my face other than this product. Although the bottle is small, it last a very, very long time. I dispense less than a full pump of the cream, around the size of a pea, and it is more than enough for my face, neck and back of my hands. The photo attached to the review was taken on my 50th birthday earlier this year. I have never been big on makeup and live in the deep south where the sun can age you well beyond your years, so finding something to halt the march of time and tame the wrinkles is a must. I apply this product to my entire face before bed and to the area around my eyes and along my laugh lines in the morning and I am good to go. This is worth every penny and works better than any of the other far more expensive name brand products I have used through the years.

Better than the expensive creams


I love this cream! I've never had dewy looking skin.. until now. After just 1 week, I've noticed that my skin tone is more even. I'm hoping this cream will purge my skin. I have a LOT of small bumps under the skin around my chin and mouth. I believe this happened when I started using anti-aging skin care products that were full of dimethicone, back in the 90's.  This cream is my last hope for getting all the crap out of my skin. I've been using alpha hydroxy acids for years because it's supposed to help purge the skin. Hasn't worked so far. I can't afford a peel in a dr's office. So, fingers crossed this cream works.

Second purchase had different results.


I used up my first purchase completely and absolutely loved it. My skin drank it up at night and when I woke up I could swear that my red spot was disappearing and my eye bags were lighter. However my second bottle turned my love sour. This bottle was less well received by my skin and caused my T-zone to become extremely oily. I now only use it for my eyelids and under eye, it seems to do well in that area.

Deceptive packaging. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin


Overall I like this product very much. I do feel like the packaging is deceptive. If you want me to think more highly of your product, which is a good product, don‚Äôt be deceptive about how much is in the container. That‚Äôs why you only got a three star from me.

Very irritating to skin


I finally tried to use this lotion on my face. But omg as soon as I applied some to my forehead it felt like my skin was on fire. I'm usually not sensitive 2 most products. I've use Clinique, clarins, Lancome, StriVectin, the anti-aging serums and lotions. But there is an ingredient in this that my skin does not agree with. I love the pump it is very handy. Too bad I can'tuse it.

Love Lilyana Products


My skin is beginning to show early signs of aging, and Lilyana products have stopped that process in its tracks. I use the Vitamin C Serum, Retinol, Face Cream, and Eye Cream. I have dry, sensitive skin, but these products never irritate.  They leave my skin looking radiant!

Very happy with this product!


I needed a moisturizer and thought I would try a Retinol product for the first time.  The product arrived sealed and does not have any smell. It goes on smoothly leaving the skin soft but not sticky, greasy or 'wet'.  And my skin stays 'soft'.  It doesn't dry out. Only a very small amount is needed to cover the entire face. I haven't used the product long enough to scientifically observe fewer wrinkles. But my skin does appear softer, less dry.  I am 70 years old and don't expect a miracle. I am very happy with this product.

So I have been using this now for a few weeks and even my husband can see the difference! The faint lines I was getting around my eyes seem to have disappeared and the deeper lines have lessened by quite a bit. I am very pleased with this and will be buying more as I run out. Just to note, I have pretty fair skin that freckles easy in the sun and am in my early 40's.

Fantastic hydrating and all-over rejuvenating lotion, even for sensitive skin!


I‚Äôve only had this face cream for a month and it has already made a noticeable improvement in both the smoothness/evenness of my skin tone, as well as beginning to minimize fine lines & creases! In only a month! The lotion is incredibly moisturizing, which is key for my dry skin, but because my skin is extra sensitive finding products gentle enough can be tough. Lily-Ana‚Äôs Retinol has not caused any additional breakouts, AND has helped eliminate them all together, while also reducing the dark spots! I even use it around my eyes and have had no reactions there, just benefits like firming and brightening. The scent is clean and simple, which I appreciate. Fantastic all around, I honestly can‚Äôt get over how impressed I am with this lotion! Looking forward to trying more Lily-Ana products, and I don‚Äôt often say that!

I‚Äôve been using this and the retinol vitamin C serum since July 15th... so 2.5 weeks. I use the vitamin c serum every night, And the retinol cream every other day. My face has continued to break out and it just getting worse. These are the only things I‚Äôve changed in my skincare routine. I had such high hopes for these products because of the reviews, so I‚Äôm super disappointed that my face is reacting so badly. I have never had acne like This, ever. I get the occasional hormonal pimple/zit. But it‚Äôs always just that one at that time of the month. I don‚Äôt see where or how to contact the company. I googled them and emailed he email that said it was Lilyana Naturals, but have not heard back. I‚Äôm so frustrated to have spent $40 just to have my face look worse than it ever has.

misleading


It is a good moisturizer, I believe that. but i think they really bank on the psychology of people looking for improvement. The retinol content is by volume, so its only gong to be like .025%. Which is fine, but seeing 2.5% on the packaging makes you think, 'oh more retinol than other products, this will be more effective', which is a little scketchy. I think its probably still comparable to the other retinol products, but that labeling did not sit well with me.

I love that this moisturizes my skin in addition to the retinol. I have very sensitive skin, and this cream doesn't dry it out at all. I also like that there aren't any overwhelming perfumes in the cream either, because scents can bring on headaches and migraines. If you are on the fence, you should give it a try for sure. I can see a difference and have only been using it for a month.

First time user of Retinol Cream and in love.


I wasn't sure what to expect when using this product, I never had used a Retinol product before and I'm truly in love.I've been using it once a day because I never have time and my skin has been improving a lot. I have oily / dry skin combo and had a problem applying foundation no matter what kind of primer I used until this product came into my life. I can't express how great this product works.Note that I factor in rose petal witch hazel and african black soap into my skin care routine, but the overall clarity and feel to my skin is better than ever.New products for skincare do take time to factor in, so don't expect to receive this product and see miracles next day.

Not a fan.


I would buy a higher % retinol product and use that.  This just wasted away in my gym bag until I used it as a body moisturizer and called it a day.  Surprising amount of product.  Covered my whole body and then some so it is a good buy on amount but active percentage of retinol is too low for the price (in my opinion). I'd rather use a higher priced product with much higher retinol but that's me.  I considered this a big waste of money for what essentially became a one time use body lotion (but at least it got used). Works well as a lotion!

But seller is great and you can afford to try this one for your skin. Also uses carcinogenic for preservative if you are sensitive to those.

Nice, natural moisturizer


I really like this moisturizer. I've never used a retinol cream before, and I was bracing myself for my skin to react adversely (I had read that skin will often do so when someone first starts using retinol) but so far, so good! I've had absolutely no issues. The moisturizer itself is a very nice consistency and absorbs quickly. It does not make my skin greasy. I've even been using it around my eyes and have had zero sensitivity issues. I can't speak to how it improves skin over the long term since I've only been using it for a week, but based on what I'm experiencing so far, I have high hopes! I like this brand a lot. Their regular face cream is also excellent (I use that one in the morning and this one -- the retinol cream -- at night). Good stuff.

Only use this cream where it needed to reduce wrinkles.

I have noticed a  slight difference after 5 days, however I did not have deep prominent wrinkles to begin with.

I have used this now for almost a month and I still have quite a bit left in the bottle which is a plus for me. I use it every other day (a full pump) for my face, neck, and chest area. I also use the Vitamin C Serum from LilyAna Naturals too. As to changes in my skin not much but that will take time but so far so good.

For me, it was not a good option. I purchased with the wonderful reviews that this product had, but for my acne/naturally oily prone skin, it made things worse.

I first ordered this cream about a year ago, and was instantly impressed with how soft my skin felt after I used it. Over the course of a week or so, I noticed a dramatic decrease in oiliness and breakouts in my skin. So, I order it once a month and use it twice a day. It costs so much less than other products I have tried in the past. As a side note: after two months of using this on my face and neck, the skin tags on my neck all fell off.

I was optimistic with the reviews when I ordered this. However, it just wasn't for me. This was much too thick for me. It didn't glide onto my face like I prefer. It didn't absorb into my skin. It just caked on the surface and dried up. I could feel it sitting on my face and I had to rinse it off, which I can totally feel sliding off of my face when I did rinse it off. But what doesn't work for me may work for others. This is why we all have a ton of moisturizers and creams in our bathrooms from all the trials and errors. Good luck.

Within a few days I could start seeing a slight difference, and at around 2 weeks a definite difference.  I am actually able to not use foundation now, and that‚Äôs a big deal for me!  In my teen years I laid out nearly every summer day and have the sun spots to show for it, but this product has very much lightened them and just overall made my skin look well cared for.  Highly recommend!

To heavy for me.


I am not one that uses a lot of makeup nor products on my face. I purchased this the same time I did their serum. I like the serum better. The cream is just to heavy for me.  I felt it for days, even after washing my face. I would exchange it for their serum, but I waited to long to try it.

Dermatologist compliments my skin now!!


I use this product daily with the face cream from LilyAnna and my skin has NEVER been so happy!I have hyperreactive skin and struggled with acne for as long as I could remember.  This retinol product has helped smooth my skin, increase cell turnover and is more gentle than anything the dermatologist gave me.  Most dermatologist products have caused severe reactions and scarring.  These products have limited my dermatologist visits to simple check ins and compliments about how great my skin looks now!

For the price you honestly can't do any better so don't try even using pro lines from spas can't compare when it comes to the over all value. I have been in the industry for 16 years why yes you can get better products when it comes to a good vitamin a (retinol) this 2.5% should be the stranded grocery and drugstore big brands need to just give up they can't beat it.

I have ance prone skin and was worried about the oils in this product. But I'm 26 and have a few fine lines. I've been using this for a week with no breakouts and my skin is so soft! This leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not oily. Wears well under makeup. Just make sure to wear sunscreen with any product containing retinol!

Allergic reaction and worsened acne


I bought this cream because of the many positive reviews, but I reacted really poorly to it. My acne-prone skin became much worse while I was using it and I broke out with both white and blackheads in places where I'd never had acne before. After 9 weeks of use, I'm giving up and assuming that I must be allergic to one of the ingredients. I'm very disappointed, since it seemed like it worked so well for others.

Best yet!


I have very sensitive skin and break out with any moisturizer I've ever used BUT NOT THIS ONE! I read reviews on Yahoo and decided to check Amazon for this product.  I just purchased my second bottle (it lasts a looooong time too...it's taken me about 4 months to get through the first bottle).  I'm 63 and had a few dark, rough patches on my face, but NO MORE!  I don't like wearing heavy makeup now that I'm retired so I was looking for something to lighten the dark patches without another visit to the dermatoligist.  I am very pleased!!!  And the price is exceptional (the first bottle I had a $5 coupon....can't beat that!).

First of all, ew. Second of all, don't trip. This moisturizer will help smooth your face like a baby's buttcheek! For real, though. I'm Asian, and I'm aging, and it's giving me massive anxiety for the first time in my 30 years of life. Well, my stress is kicked to the curb with this dang lotion. I have no idea what Retinol even is chemically, but all I know is that I feel like I'm back to my former self with this item.

Skin Aging Maintenance Starts In Your 20's


To start- I'm a 28 yo/ female with fair skin and a predisposition to burn and scar easily. I've been living in Colorado for the last year and I was warned the altitude and cold weather are not great for the skin. Everyone was correct about this. Fine lines have been dramatized and full-on crow's feet started settling in. This was only magnified by my mineral makeup that settles in the creases.Fast forward to a month ago, I started to use LilyAna's Retinol Cream. I started using it twice a day, as recommended, but found it made the tip of my nose peel and facial skin became sensitive. I'm using the cream once a day, under my makeup, which has been the best amount for me. I've seen a tremendous change- deep lines are significantly lightened, almost erased. My old acne scars from the early 20's are even smoothing out. I now have the confidence to go makeup free out in broad daylight! That is huuuuge for me.I can't wait to continue using this fantastic product.

This is a nice face lotion, but it is not an effective retinol cream. I'm not a chemist, all I know is that I never felt any effect from this even using 2xDay. My wife bought another OTC cream and whoa, baby, I can feel this one working. Can't even do every day yet. Soooo, yeah. I don't this this has an effective Vitamin A component.

I would not recommend


This product stung my skin and made it itch terribly.I will start off saying I have been using this product for over a month.  I do not consider my skin to be sensitive and would say my skin type is combination to normal.  I have also used retinol products in the past without any issues.  I noticed after about 2 weeks my skin was stinging after I applied my lotions and serums (this always occurred in the evening, which is when I was putting this on).  I kept using it as I wasn't sure what was causing the issues.  Through process of elimination I realized it was this cream, along with the fact that I was using this on my neck and chest and was noticing the same burning and itching.  It was so bad that I would scratch until I was red.  I also believe this cream was causing some dryness in my skin.

Great for sensitive skin


My skin is sensitive due to allergies to fragrance and multiple other substances and I never have a reaction to Lilyana products. I use the vitamin C cream and face cream with this product and consider this the best skin care routine I have tried out of dozens of products. I have noticed acne scars clear up a little faster and reduction of fine lines around my eyes.

Not for me :(


It's not for me. The product is quickly absorved by my skin, but as a result my skin was dull, dry, and fine lines in my forehead (that I didn't even know I had) became more evident. I used in combination with the Face cream in which I didn't like either. I used the face cream in the morning, but my skin became red. Since use to have a problem with melasma, I thought the redness caused by the product could aggravate or bring back my melasmas. None of the products have sun screen. I was looking for products without dimethicone, but unfortunately these products were not a good fit for me.

Used Entire Container - No Noticeable Results


I purchased this product a few months ago and have used it every night religiously. I am now down to the tail end of the product and decided to write a review. I'm 29 with oily/acne prone skin.This is a budget friendly retinol cream, that gets the job done as a basic night time moisturizer. I will not be purchasing again, since I did not see any results or benefits to using it.  For the price I'd rather stick with a basic Olay or Cetaphil.Pros:- Cost- Consistency (rich. but may be a little heavy for some)- Did not irritate my skin or cause me to break out (didn't prevent any breakouts either)Cons:- Effectiveness (Has not diminished my fine lines. I'm 29 and starting to notice some lines on my forehead.  Nothing has changed after using this product)- Smell (It's not supposed to have a scent, but it smells kind of chemically or even fishy at times)

The best creme ever!


This creme is amazing! I been using it for couple of weeks and really see and feel the difference. I highly recommend it to anyone who is over 30's.I don't recommend wearing it during the day as retinol makes skin more sensitive to the sun so its better to use it for your night regime. I also recommend using it ever second day as retinol especially if you have sensitive skin as I do. Overall amazing retinol product for a superb price! You won't regret it.

Surprise Rash


I bought this product after finally having almost 100% clear skin after a decade of acne issues in hopes it would help reduce the scarring on my face. I used it for about 3 weeks and everything seemed fine. As some people pointed out, it doesn't absorb right away and there is a white film, but this didn't bother me. I woke up most mornings, and my skin seem moisturized, but I don't know if it was doing anything different than my Neutorgena daily moisturizer. Around the third week, I all of a sudden developed a large patch of red bumps under my eye that carried over to the side of my nose. I stopped using this product and after a little over a week of not using it, the bumps have almost completely gone away. I think this product was to blame and therefore, I don't plan on using it anymore.

Seems to work alright, but wow it‚Äôs a heavy cream


Love the effects - I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm imagining the fine lines on my forehead diminishing - but have found that it‚Äôs a  pretty greasy formula. This is coming from someone whose skin is so dry it‚Äôs been known to crack and bleed. It‚Äôs also currently the middle of Pittsburgh‚Äôs winter, so believe that I love me a hydrating face cream. This just feels really heavy on my skin and for longer than I‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve also been trying to use it sparingly, as I suspect it‚Äôs causing me to break out more than usual in my problem areas.That being said, I‚Äôve gone from am and pm use, to now just before I go to bed, and it seems to ease the clogged pores and the weight of the cream doesn‚Äôt bother me as much because, you know, I‚Äôm asleep.

Considered Botox--don't need it after using this for a month


This is the first retinol cream I've purchased, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I'm absolutely sold. At 27, I was starting to develop noticeable forehead wrinkles; I looked into retinol creams before diving into something extreme like Botox, and thought I would put off spending a few hundred bucks and try this first. This stuff is absolutely amazing. I've been using the cream for about a month and have already noticed a severe reduction in the fine lines that were beginning to form in my face over the last several years. Plus an added bonus, which I was not expecting, is that this product has also helped to even out my skin tone and reduce redness (with the addition of a rose petal toner to my skincare regimen that was recommended in an earlier review).This stuff is heavy when compared to daily moisturizers, and it does have a slight alcohol scent. Because of this, I've only applied it at night, and still have seen fantastic results. I tend to have oilier skin, but could see how this could either dry out your face (as all retinol creams do), or make you break out.Bottom line: I did a horrible job of taking care of my skin in my teenage and early adult years, and this stuff seems to have undone much of the damage I unknowingly had done. My skin appears very similar to what it looked like when I was 18/19, except with more even tone and less redness. Do yourself a favor and save on expensive skincare products (and makeup, you can seriously wear less after the cream takes effect), and try this stuff out.

I will continue to use this until gone, but will not repurchase. Initially, its non-fragranced but it definitely has this off fishy smell. It doesn't last, but it kind of smell like fish oil pills.

Sometimes great, sometimes smells like fish food


I've ordered this twice now, and my first batch was fantastic.  No smell.  My second one, smells like fish, which is really nasty?! The smell disappears fairly quickly, but it is pretty unpleasant.I don't know if the smell means it's a bad batch and means that the retinol cream won't work as good or not.  I haven't noticed any changes to my skin since I've been using my fishy batch.  Amazon also isn't allowing me to return this batch since I bought it a month ago and just now started using it.  Don't know if I'll go for round 3.Edit: Instead of returning the product through Amazon, I messaged the seller asking about the smell, and they responded,""Since our products are created with all natural ingredients ‚Äìratherthan harsh chemicals,some separation or changes in the consistency orsmell of the products can occur when shipped in warmer temps.Since we do not add any artificial fragrance, any scent comes from thenatural ingredientsused in the cream, so the scent can vary from batch to batch.""Anyways, they offered to send a replacement cream free of charge!

Does what it says it'll do


Picked this up at the suggestion of a friend who suggested it for some odd spots around my eyes, not for any anti-aging purpose, but one day I got asked by a couple work acquaintances if I'd done something to my eyes. So I looked at some relatively recent photos before I started using this and you know, there's a difference. It's not botox dramatic, which is good, but I can't deny it's there. It's truly unscented, which is crucial in my line of work, and didn't irritate my irritatingly irritable skin in the least. One jar also lasted me forever, so it's hardly an extravagance.

Love this cream!


I have had really bad hormonal cystic acne for the last year or two. My dermatologist and I have cleared it up for the most part with Spironolactone, but now I've left with a lot of stubborn scars that are taking their time leaving. So I've definitely tried my share of products. What I love about this retinol cream is that it's unscented, which is definitely preferable for skincare, and seems really gentle overall-- at least for me, I've never noticed that it dries me out or irritates me (which is SUPER rare for my skin!). Like I said, I was mainly interested in something to help fade my scars, but I'm pleasantly surprised by how it has helped my skin texture overall. I feel like I've had an improvement in my pore size, my skin just feels more supple and youthful. AND it has helped fade my acne scars (patience is key with this, though). Definitely reordered it!

Over 60 and looking 50


I have tried several products with Retinol and pretty pleased with this one.  Too often the creams are heavy and leave a greasy film and when you add moisturizer , you tend to look way too shiny.  This cream absorbs very quickly and has a nice light texture.  Currently using only at night  and skin feels very smooth in the morning.  Important to me - I can pronounce all the ingredients! No irritation or stinging.  I will consider more products from this company.

Pretty decent so far.


My skin seems to feel more smooth and I actually haven't had any bad reactions compared to other retinol creams. I do notice my t-zone being more oily but I'm waiting to see if that's just my skin adjusting to the cream.

Runny/oily


It did feel like it made my skin smoother,  but I used it in the beginning of summer and my sweat plus this cream made me very oily and not only that, when I sweat, the product would weep into my eyes and slightly sting all day. I kept it away from my eyes when I applied it, It‚Äôs not like I worked out in it, I‚Äôm not saying I sweat profusely. Just the normal getting in my hot car and walking back to work across the street etc.  This is my first retinol cream and I‚Äôd like another that isn‚Äôt as thin/runny when you sweat.

Great affordable retinol


I am in my mid 30s and was looking for affordable anti ageing products. I found this product after watching a video about retinol by Susan Yara (beauty blogger). She recommended this product because it's 2.5% retinol which is pretty strong for an over the counter retinol and is gentle on skin. I've used the LilyAna retinol for at least 6 months now and love it!! It's gentle on skin, although I would recommend using it 1-2x per week at first and slowly working up to everyday use. I use it every night and have seen my forehead, crow's feet, and laugh lines soften significantly. I would highly recommend this product to add to your skin care routine.

I have extremely sensitive skin and was breaking that bank buying an expensive moisturizer for a while until I came across this one. I loved this so much that I‚Äôve now ordered it 4 times. It‚Äôs light, has a light smell and works great under makeup as well as without. I‚Äôve never had any breakout issues with it and am so glad I found a great moisturizer at a very reasonable price.

I use in the morning and night and feel the difference it makes.

Youth serum!


At first, I purchased the Face Cream and loved it so much I decided to purchase the Vitamin C serum.  Now, I own all products made by LilyAna and I love them all.  I tend to have oily skin and their products still work wonders.  The Face Cream absorbs super quick so it's easy to moisturize in the morning, then quickly follow with my makeup routine.I LOVE the Retinol cream.  I use it every night on my face, neck, and chest.  I highly recommend these products.  You won't be disappointed.

I haven't seen it do much to my acne so I feel its better just to soften skin for me


This cream does leave your skin softer and helps shed that top layer of skin. There was a milia on one of my eye that's been there for over a year, and this helped get rid of it. This cream is primarily scent free and doesn't irritated my skin. This contains a lot of extracts and some are even organic. The bottle is only 1.7 oz so its not a lot of product. Though since I only use it on certain spots, it is lasting me for awhile. While this is gentle by itself, I did try using it with another product that is prone to irritation which ended up irritated my skin during the winter time. So I would advise not using with other irritation-prone products. This cream has helped soften the drier tough skin on my elbows and feet. I haven't seen it do much to my acne so I feel its better just to soften skin for me.

Great product.


I have done a lot of research and feel pretty versed in skincare. I love this product. It has a high percentage of retinol which I prefer and I have not had any negative issues while using. I apply every night after double cleansing and before anything else. I try to give this product at least half an hour before I continue with the rest of my routine. I have been using this for probably three weeks continuously and am already noticing a huge difference in the fine lines on my forehead that I hate. This is one of the few skincare products I can actually say I have seen real results from. I would highly recommend and I will be repurchasing when I run out!

I have only been using this product for a week or two but am already in love. I am 27 so i use this more for prevention than treatment but have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. I use it 1-2 times per day on my face, neck, and chest and immediately noticed my skin feels so soft afterwards. I would compare it to the softness and smoothness after a primer is applied prior to makeup. I havent noticed any burning afterwards and make sure to wear sunscreen if applied on the morning. I raved so much about this product that both of my sisters purchased it, unfortunately it is not safe for breastfeeding so only one of them was actually able to use it.

Customer for life!


I have combination skin that is incredibly sensitive and reactive, and for years, I just resigned myself to the fact that products that could really change my skin would just be too harsh.  This retinol cream has changed that completely.  I didn't have the foresight to take before/after pictures, but my skin looks incredible now; I used to break out like crazy along my jawline, and my forehead plagued with milia, but a few weeks' usage of this cream has made that all disappear.  Additionally, my skin tone is more even, and I find myself touching my face often during the day because it is just so smooth! I started out using this once every other day, right before bed, and I have had no irritation or dryness whatsoever.  Additionally, I've used it in combination with the Vitamin C serum and Rose & Pomegranate Face Cream from LilyAna Naturals, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

Inflammation & redness


Eventhough i did a patch test, I developed a reaction when I used this cream in conjunction with the lily Ana face cream after 1.5 weeks of use. I developed large red patches (inflammation) of skin on my face and neck. I had to visit a dermatologist to understand what's going on.  She immediately asked me to stop using the products and was prescribed a hydrocortisone cream to reduce the inflammation.Please be careful as one may not get any reaction initially but maybe 2 5 days later, when it tries to with work it's magic.

I ordered the product in hopes to prevent my fine lines from getting worse. I haven't used the product very much yet. I am not in a habit of applying it daily. I like the pump, it's easy to apply. The cream doesn't feel too heavy or too light on my face. It feels smooth and soft on my skin. I was most impressed by the follow up email I received from the business inquiring about my experience and making sure I was a happy customer. How wonderful to have a business care about their customers. I will recommend this product and the business to all. I'm very pleased.

I have been using this product since January (3 months). If you are not into a good routine of washing your face every night (which I wasn't), you will notice that this hydrates your skin.  I didn't have any dryness as I normally have an oily complexion.  There are NO significant changes in my skin at all.  The significant changes have come from me cutting sugar out of my diet, going to more plant based eating and from quitting smoking.  I used this for two months before changing my diet.  Period.

I'm so skeptical about products like this but I've been very impressed and just bought my 2nd jar. I have sun spots from years of tanning beds and being outside. Nothing has ever lightened or gotten rid of them.....until I tried this cream! Most of my sunspots have faded away and the worst one is barely noticeable now. Even my number 11 lines between my eyes are not as deep as they were before. I also have sensitive skin and a lot of products will make me break out, but this did not.

Made me break out


I don't have the most sensitive skin and was only using this at night as I use a bb cream in the morning but I noticed within a few days that I was breaking out more so than usual. After about two and a half weeks I stopped using it and switched back to the face lotion that I was using previously at night and my skin cleared up in a few day. It felt very thick, that was nice especially during the winter. There was a bit of sting to using it but this was the first time I used anything that was suppose to be anti-aging so I figured that was just part of it.

This is a great product with a great formulation!


This stuff is great, the texture of the product and the way it leaves my face feeling is perfect for applying makeup or night time products on top. It leaves the skin feeling soft and lightly moisturized without being greasy at all. As a retinol product, it only took my skin about a month to adjust to the product -that's with daily use morning and night, btw- with minimal drying effects and no redness or irritation to speak of. My pores look smaller, my skin texture is smoother and more refined, it looks healthy and glowy even when I do get a breakout. Really can't find anything I don't like about this product so far.

Pleasantly surprised!


So most of my adult life (I'm 42) I've suffered from acne.  I saw dermatologists, that put me on all different medications, that would work for a limited time.  After our health insurance stopped covering effective forms of treatment, I was on my own again, and my acne got worse,,again.  I'm so glad I found this cream, my face is 85% clearer, with little to no new breakouts.  I combine this with the vitamin C serum to aid in the healing of old scars and spots and I'm incredibly happy with the results.  Absorbs quickly, not greasy, even my 18yr old daughter loves it which means I'm buying it often-I do wish it came in a larger size.

Clears acne and dark marks


I am a light-skin African american woman. My skin scars so easily from acne. This product worked miracles for me. Within a week, my intermediate to severe acne and acne scarring cleared up.  However, there is a routine that you must stick to. With this product I would also use the Tru Skin Vitamin C serum that you can get here on amazon. You apply that first. You let it dry. Then you use the retinol. But most importantly, whenever you leave the house you must wear sunscreen. Retinol and vitamin C are sensitive to the U.V light. So if you do not wear sunscreen, the product can do the opposite effect and make your skin worse. Furthermore U.V light, just in general, causes dark pigmentation on the skin from acne or wounds. You should be wearing sunscreen everyday regardless. If you are looking for a good facial cleanser to add to the routine, Oxy Acne Medication works well to rid of the acne. Like I said, this product is amazing. Out of all the products I mentioned, this was the one that made the biggest difference in clearing up my skin. I hope someone ends up following my routine. I promise it works.

I liked it so much I bought more within a couple of days.


My husband bought this for me as a gift. I have to say I was a little upset. I'm 66 years old and he's never mentioned anything about my skin or looks. His explanation was that a lot of the face creams currently being advertised contain Retinol and he thought I might like to try it. So, I gave it a try but I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical. Well, I was wrong. I started using this on my face and hands and started to notice a difference within a few days. A lady I work with also noticed the difference and asked what I was doing different. To make a long story short, I had my husband order two more jars last week. My face and hands are smoother and softer.

Works great!  Acne is gone.  Ordering bottle #2!


I'm a 43 year-old male who has had mild acne since I was a teenager.  I can barely remember ever going more than two or three days without some sort of acne on my face.  I bought a bottle of Retinol Cream Moisturizer mid July 2018.  I used it morning and night for about two weeks and noticed minimal improvement in my skin.  I was beginning to question whether this product would work.  I began using it only in the morning, probably about a half of a dime's worth and would it spread across my face and nose. I stopped using an aftershave on my face as this would seem to moisturize my face adequately. After about four weeks' of use, my face was noticeably better.  After about six weeks, my acne was virtually gone.  I just ran out of this product yesterday (Dec 26) and I'm ordering my second bottle.  I've used the product every day since it arrived.  My skin looks great.  I get the occasional pimple, but now it's like one pimple instead of ten.  And if i do get a pimple, it's typically so small it's barely noticeable.  I've never been so pleased with a product.  I hope you get the same results as me.

I'm not sure how much it has helped with wrinkles but it seems to speed up the healing process for my acne.

I wanted to like this product. I wanted to, so much, that I tried it for three months and varied the frequency every 3-4 weeks from once a week to once every other day. Each time, without fail, it gave my 40-year old skin 4-5 pimples the next day (usually in the cheek area). I had read the reviews warning about sensitive skin responses and can confirm that it's not for everyone. I will be trying a different product with a retanoid at a lower volume instead. Good luck!

Best face cream!


I was unsure if I would like this product as I have sensitive skin. I am in love with this cream. It really has helped with my sun spots. I ended up buying the rest of the products they have for the face.

50 looking 35! This Stuff Just Works!!


I've been using it for over 2yrs now and it does what it's supposed to do - Keep The Wrinkles Away! Obviously, this is just one part of my overall ""system"" for keeping the grill looking young and vibrant BUT it's a huge part. There's no need to spend $100 on retinol creams by big box brands.

Moisturizing and helps skin stay clear


It‚Äôs a nice cream.  Not life changing, but I did not expect  that.  My face stays clear, and I haven‚Äôt had a reaction to it although I have sensitive skin.I only have minor breakouts due to my cycle, but it seems to keep that under control. It dried my skin a bit at first, but I now only use it every other night and it seems fine.  Considering the price, it‚Äôs not a bad product. I also love that it‚Äôs not scented.  Wrinkles?

Scentless, non-greasy, and absorbs very well


I haven't noticed any changes in my skin after about 6 weeks of use, but I can certainly appreciate it for it's absorbency and non-greasy feeling. I docked it by one star because it comes in a very stupid pump action dispenser that cannot be disassembled, meaning you will never get 100% of the contents out of the container - what a waste!

Loved it til the swelling started


Really loved this product for about four months.  It goes on silky smooth and doesn‚Äôt fell greasy.  Using it according to the directions, I had no breakouts, just smooth, soft skin. I also compared it with my known allergy list and thought I was good to go, but then I started to notice a puffiness above my cheekbone, first on the right and a few weeks later on the left.  I stopped this product and the swelling went down, but when I restarted it the swelling returned.  Guess I need to add retinal to my allergy list.  Really sorry to have to throw this product out because I really liked it.

Disappointed


I really wanted to like this product after reading the reviews. I bought it mainly to help get rid of white bumps known as milia on my face, along with a sun spot on my nose. The reviews had said it helped lightened dark spots. An added bonus would have been to tighten my aging skin as people said it helped with theirs. I've used it for 2 months and I've seen absolutely no improvement on any of my 3 issues. I will be looking for another product now.

It really works if you‚Äôre consistent


I went to Japan this past summer and I was in the sun a lot. I came back and realized I had really defined wrinkles on my forehead. As a 20 year old I started to freak out. I ordered this and I‚Äôm shocked that the wrinkles look so much better and not as defined. I started using in October but wasn‚Äôt using it consistently because it caused bumps on my forehead. I heard that was normal and pushed through them and now it‚Äôs January and my skin looks so much better. I 100% recommend I was so self conscious before and really didn‚Äôt think anything could help!

Moisturizing retinol cream


I was pleasantly surprised to see how moisturizing this retinol cream is. It really helps me be able to use it regularly without my sensitive skin peeling badly and keeps my acne at bay. By far much better than other retinol products I've used. It provides the same benefits from the retinol while not drying my face out! I was really worried my skin wouldn't like on of the other ingredients by it made my skin look more radiant and clear than before. I use it before or after my normal moisturizer as I mostly use it on target areas for acne.

You won't be disappointed... try it!!!


A few things to take into consideration... I am mid-thirties, mother of two prepubescent boys, and in nursing school. Now with that said, I needed something (desperately) to help my skin stay youthful. I usually break out after trying anything new so I was a bit hesitant to try this, but I took the leap anyway. I did not have any bad reaction whatsoever! I did notice that I needed to exfoliate more often than I normally did, but each time I exfoliated it revealed a new softer, more youthful layer. Even my biggest critic (my mother), complimented how amazing my complexion looked! The first bottle I purchased has already lasted 6 weeks and I can tell it's almost out, so I bought another and will not go without this product in my facial regimen.

Vastly improved my rough, uneven and sensitive skin


I've been using this product for about six weeks but started seeing results in about three weeks.  My skin was plagued with large pores, rough bumpy texture, dry patches, redness, yellow splotches, sun damage, acne scars and wrinkles.  I use it every night because I keep seeing more improvement every few days with ALL of my skin issues.  It's 2% retinol which sounds irritatingly high, but it's surprisingly gentle on my very sensitive skin.  I think because it's mostly organic and made with natural oils, butters and botanical extracts.  Using it every night for six weeks, I still have over half a bottle left...one bottle will likely last 3 months or more.  If you've priced other retinol creams, you will conclude for yourself that this is a DEAL and as you can see from all the other reviews...it's very effective.  If it can improve my skin, it can improve anyones.

This is a solid Retinol  lotion for your face that actually lets you use all of it. I love the bottle design as it allows you to completely use it.

This retinol cream is fantastic! I noticed a difference in the way my skin felt after the first use. after the 3rd use I could see a softness as well as feel it. Love it and will be a steady customer. The company even sent an email to explain the use of this product and to contact them if I should have problems (which I have not, not even any redness or peeling). This does work well with their face cream. My only complaint would be the container. Can't visually tell the amount that is in container. Therefore won't know when to reorder until I run out.

The product works well, but I'd also like to commend LilyAna on their selection of dispenser. I know, that is a weird statement, but my wife and I are constantly cutting up various product packages to extract the large amounts of product stranded at the bottom of the packaging. Coming to the end of pump-action for this product I proceeded to pull apart it apart to get to the last goods. Much to my surprise, the pump that LIlyAna uses is able to extract every last drop of the product from the packaging. Well done, and thank you for helping us get our money's worth, and reducing waste!

I won't lie - I chose this one partially because of the packaging lol but it did also have great reviews. Within just a month of using it


I NEVER write reviews, but I have to for this product.  I've been using this for about a month now and I'm blown away by the results.  I've had deep laugh lines for several years that went from the edges of my nose all the way to the outer corners of my mouth.  I had tried primers and anything I could get my hands on to fill these in, as my makeup would always settle into these.  Being 31, I figured it was time to add retinol into my skincare routine.  I won't lie - I chose this one partially because of the packaging lol but it did also have great reviews.  Within just a month of using it, those lines are gone!  That is no exaggeration at all - they are literally gone.  I'm working to get rid of the line between my eyebrows (I squint more than anyone should!).  I have no doubts this product will do it for me.  I can also highly recommend their Vitamin C Serum.  I'm a die hard customer now and will be trying all of their products.My only complaint - I'm just going to have to keep a backup bottle on hand, because I can't tell how much is left in the bottle.

This really is a gentle but quickly effective retinol cream, I highly recommend it for anyone seeking some resurfacing of their skin without going into a full peeling mode that can be too much for some. And all the products in this line are fragrance free, are silky and easy to apply, great for your skin! I am in my late 40's but already post-menopausal so my skin is tricky, can get too dry quickly when I apply retinol, but this one is much easier to use because it works more gently but works fast! So you can easily adjust and target your needs with it.

Works Like a Prescription


My dermatologist said the skin on my forehead was ""congested"" (ew) and that's why it looked so weird lately. She prescribed a retinol cream and I was totally ready to use it. I've had success with retinoid/retinol prescriptions before. But the cost was prohibitive, so I had to try something OTC, which I didn't want to do since they're usually crap. THIS cream, however, worked like a charm and did it quickly too. It *feels* like I'm using a prescription cream - there's that tingling with the first few uses and the need for an additional moisturizer. But it's certainly doing what it is supposed to - my forehead looks super tightened and clear for the first time in about a year.

This is the first Retinol cream I've ever used, so I have nothing to compare it with, however since using it there's a noticeable difference in my skin.

At first it seemed my skin was flaking more than usual, but after a couple of weeks it was gone, and I noticed the texture of my skin was, for the first time in years, actually soft.

This had a terrible fishy smell to it and caused a cystic acne breakout that lasted 2+month and i had not had a problem with acne for more than 20 years. If the product has a problem with warmer weather when shipping and that causes it to smell i would say there is a problem with the product. The breakout lasted more than 2 months so if you're willing to risk having your social life put on hold for 2+ month go ahead and try it.

I have very minimal dryness (mostly just around the corners of my mouth) but nothing like the flaking and sloughing I've had with other creams


Hey! So as someone who has used a retinol several times in her life, I have to say this is the LEAST abrasive, most gentle and effective cream I have used. I was extremely hesitant to order at first because I didn't want to fall into the ""permanent red face"" life again just to have small pores. But the selling point for me is when you said I can put it on my eyes and eyelids. And you were right. I have very minimal dryness (mostly just around the corners of my mouth) but nothing like the flaking and sloughing I've had with other creams. I use once a day (before bed) maybe 5 times a week. I'm very happy with it, not too heavy or uncomfortable. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a retinol since all others I've tried are painful and make my skin dry and red. And considering it is summer time and I do enjoy a little vitamin D on my days off, I'm very happy with this product.

Great for sensitive skin


Anytime I try something new my face will immediately react negatively but it did not with this. I have a dark patch on my cheek that feels like it's always been there but after using this, it's finally starting to lighten. This stuff works very well but remember to use sunscreen or it will have an opposite effect. I also recently learned that this is a small family owned business so anytime I can support small businesses I'm all for it!

TEST THIS BEFORE YOU PUT ALL OVER YOUR FACE!


I used this product only twice..two nights in a row...and went from having no blemishes to a face full of tiny, rough bumps.  It looks like my face is covered in a rash.  This has taught me a valuable lesson...always test products on a small area before covering your entire face.  I will heal, but what  a disappointment!

Really nice, but smells bad.


Nice cream. Feels great on my skin and seems to make a difference in tone and texture. Even after just a week I felt like my skin had a glow to it and a smoothness that it didnt have before. But it smells bad. It has a weird fishy smell to it when you first put it on. So I think I'll try a different retinol cream when this runs out.

I've been using this for about 18 months now. Fabulous! The only thing that helps my dry skin without leaving me feeling totally greasy! Works with my daughter's teenage combination skin as well. I love the bottle too, the pump doles out just the right amount, so I don't feel I am wasting it and it lasts a good while. Definitely a value for it's effectiveness. My girlfriends, mother, daughter and sister have tried it and now love it too. And the company is very friendly and responsive. Always nice to find a good product from a responsible shop. üòä

My favorite retinol product!


I have to say that this product will remain part of my skincare regimen for a long time!  I am super sensitive to retinol but this product has calming and moisturizing ingredients that is a plus for us with sensitive skin.  I gave it 5 stars for scent because there isn‚Äôt one which is a huge deal for me.  I suffer from migraines and most scents trigger them.  A little bit goes a long way too.  No need to pump a bunch out.  I‚Äôve been using this product since September and am pleased with the results so far.  I have a lot of sun damage and some scarring and both are fading.  Wish I did before and after pics.  Definitely a great product!

I started using this about a month ago after reading the reviews on how great it was.  I have sun damage on my chest, as well as some redness on my cheeks and my dermatologist prescribed retinol.  The prescription strength irritated my skin, though.  This seems to be working.  I've noticed that my chest and face are less red and I did not have any dryness or irritation as some others have reported.  I am also using the Vitamin C Serum along with it and that seems to be effective.  I'll definitely keep using!

Naturally helps to reduce wrinkles!


Although I can't say this has been a ""miracle"" cream, I have seen some definite improvements in wrinkle lines on my face.  What I like most, is that it's nearly natural compared to the majority of retinol creams out there, goes on smooth and for this very sensitive skinned person...didn't cause any breakout of any kind.  The only thing I did notice, was some drying out of my skin in a few spots, which I simply used coconut oil on.  Hoping to someday try out their face cream as well. :))

I'm in my early 60s and never expect huge changes from something applied topically. All this being said, I have used prescription and over the counter retinol for years. I had not used any in a while and have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin since beginning this product. I am now using  three of this company's products and I'm pleased with each of them.

I'm agreeing with so many above reviews and wanted to add to it a little. My experience is smaller pores, faded lines, also I have had my make up stay in place all day. Same make up I have used for many years. But by the afternoon it would be oily, smeared, eye shadow would be moved. I would need to pat dry my face and reapply it or use a dry powder. Mostly in the summer. Last summer I was so grateful to try this product. Really has made a difference. Thank you!

I've been using this product every other day-ish for about two years now, and I honestly can't imagine using anything else.  It's super moisturizing, has helped reduce what would have become wrinkles around my eyes, and doesn't irritate my skin at all, at a fraction of what you'd pay for a big name brand.

Skin tone is even, dark circles under eyes are gone, and my skin feels and looks fresh. This is now a permanent part of my skin care.

I like this retinol cream, I use it with the vitamin C serum. I have very sensitive skin that‚Äôs prone to rosacea so I don‚Äôt use it everyday. If I do it makes my skin dry and flaky, so I switched to using the retinol every other or every two days.

So, I got this cream because I wanted a decent retinol cream, but I'm also into natural products. This is the best of both worlds.

I have Rosacea, therefore, I have very sensitive skin and am always on the look out for well-priced (while still effective) skin care. I saw the reviews for the LilyAna line AND it was on lightning deal so I snapped it up. I have used it every night for 2 weeks and have seen a significant reduction in redness and bumps. I actually keep it in the refrigerator so it is nice and soothing. You can use this day and night, but retinol makes skin more sensitive to UV so wear sunblock!

Not what I'm looking for in a retinoid


The good: Didn't cause burning, flaking, or redness to my sensitive skin.The bad: No effect appreciated. Advertises by 2.5% retinol but that is BY VOLUME, so the actual concentration is much lower. Slight chemical smell. Too thick to put a moisturizer on top but not hydrating enough to be used without moisturizer.Ultimately I'm looking for a strong retinoid and this just isn't it.

Recommended for any skin type


There's a light scent that disappears, very moisturizing which has been great since I just delivered my baby boy I was having some dry skin bouts and helped get rid of my wrinkles I've been gaining since I had him and my dry skin as well. I recommend for anyone looking to help clear their acne up as well because it really is making my skin clear up and with more uses I'm excited to say I won't need foundation anymore! Being a codmotologist their recommended application of tapping it into skin is perfect as that message technique helps get blood flowing and absorbtion is quick into the pores. With one use I saw changes!

So Happy I tried This


I love the way it goes on so easily. It's creamy and so moisturising without a perfume scent. My skin is ultra sensitive and touch reactive. But when I put this on at night my skin doesn't turn red and it isn't drying. Even in the cold it keeps my skin feeling protected. Love this!

Great for a dry winter skin


I have a very sensitive skin on my face and I do great with this product.  If it too heavy I break out, if its too light I don't get the moisture I need.  I put this on first thing in the morning after I wash my face and I am set for the day.  I do not wear makeup with a face mask on so this is the only product I use.  I have been using this product  for a few years now.  I like the feel and the price.

Great customer Service


This was the 2nd purchase I made of this product. Really enjoyed the first bottle, made my face very smooth and is quite moisturizing. The second purchase for some reason the lotion had a bit of a funky smell. Nothing horrendous but just not something I wanted to put on my face. I contacted LilyAna customer service and right away I was sent a new bottle. No funky smell, so maybe I just got a strange batch. Regardless, great product and great customer service so I'll be purchasing again.

Not good, not bad, not much of anything really


I am almost finished with a bottle after using twice a day for the past 4-6 weeks in addition to my skin care regime and cannot see a single benefit from it. Skin texture is a little smoother I would imagine from the twice a day attention and moisturizing but I would not attribute it to this product.There was no tingling or anything signalling it's ""working"" ‚Äî¬†just felt like another layer of cream to slather on. Meh. I won't bother with this one again.

I have tried so many different products and most are irritating and cause my skin to get flakey.  I watched a video from one of my favorite make-up youtubers Bailey Sarian and she shared about this retinol cream in replacement to prescribed ones. I have used it daily and on the picture you can see my skin has a glow dew look. I think my skin looks much healthier.

Cream&Customer Service A+++


NOT paid/prompted to give this review, just very happy with the product and follow up.The Cream:LOVE it. Went through Esthetics school so am well versed in ingredients and products. Wanted to try this to get away from a lot of the harsh chemicals we used and am very impressed! It‚Äôs a very thick cream, spreads well, leaves my skin moisturized, and love the natural ingredients. Been using less than a week, and already can see/feel a difference in texture, color evenness, and just leaves me feeling ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù and tighter.Customer service- Recieved an email day after purchase with a PDF on usage, saying e-mails are all looked at and responded to personally by Krista, and telling about the family run company. Received follow up e-mail a few days later asking if I had received it, how I was liking it, etc. NO push for positive reviews which was honestly a breath of fresh air. Responded telling her I loved the cream itself, but if I could change anything it would be the pump top instead of a jar. Got an email back the same day explaining the pump top (it apparently has a disc around the bottom and each time it is dispensed the disc raises so you can get all of the product out of the container, and is not a jar that is exposed to air to keep the integrity of the ingredients) which does make a lot of sense being a natural product. I have ordered MANY things from small companies on Amazon before, and this customer service is IMPRESSIVE.Because of the great follow up and honestly superior product at a fraction of the cost of some of the ‚Äòfancier‚Äô names we all know, I will be buying the Vitamin C serum and Eye cream to try, as well as continuing the use of the Retinol cream.Found out my mom (54) had bought the regular moisturizer and she loves that too. She is one that would buy a $100 Cream just because ‚Äòyou get what you pay for‚Äô, but said that she won‚Äôt ever do that again after using LilyAnas. I concur!

I love this Retinol Cream.  Paired with LilyAna's Vitamin C serum, they have significantly improved the appearance and condition of my skin.  My skin glows!  The only (slight) drawback is that I have to be careful when using it around my eyes. It causes some dryness and irritation.  I try to use it only once per day on my eyes (or every other day) and immediate follow-up with a moisturizer.  That seems to have done the trick!  I love this product and plan to repurchase and make this a permanent part of my beauty routine.

Beware. Not for all skin types


I have been using this product for roughly two months now, started using it from January end. I really wanted to love this product after reading all the good reviews and that‚Äôs why I decided not to jump on any conclusion right away. I waited for two months to see good results. Let me start by saying that I have a combination skin with oily T zone. This cream doesn‚Äôt moisturize at all. The moment I put it on my face I see small flakes while application. Which has never happened to me with any product since I have combo skin.I contacted the company and they suggested me to cut back the usage to every 2-3 nights which I was already doing. So no improvementsThis is not a product for all skins. Not to mention it gave me occasional adult acne‚Äôs too. Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again

Good and inexpensive


After my 27 birthday I thought it was time to start using retinol cream consistently. This was the first one I have used because it was relatively inexpensive. I would lie to preface it with it is a retinol so it can dry you out. I have oily skin so that hasn't been a major issue, but if you already have dry skin you need to use additional moisturizers. My main motivation to start using this was because of my acne scars which I can say are getting better slowly.

I like that this product is unscented, creamy and a little goes a long way. I have sensitive and oily skin and this product has caused zero break outs and doesn't make me oily/greasy. Goes great under foundation.

All over my face skin looks more youthful. Highly recommend just make sure to wear sunscreen daily.

Great Product!  Doesn‚Äôt irritate and actually does what is promised!


I was using this product for over 6 months and I absolutely loved it!  I have always struggled with cystic acne and ended up with some scars and dark spots on my cheeks because of it.  Since using this product, the acne has practically disappeared, the scars aren‚Äôt as defined and easier to cover with make up, and the dark spots are barely noticeable without makeup.  And the best part is that this retinol cream doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin, or dry it out.  I have extremely sensitive skin and it‚Äôs hard to find products that don‚Äôt irritate or cause break outs, so once I find one, I stick with it!

This is the best retinol cream I've found at this price point. My skin feels hydraited but not greasy. I've noticed continued improvement to the overall texture and reduction of fine lines. It has even improved my acne prone areas! Highly recommended!

Not worth the hype!


I used it twice a day everyday for two weeks. I saw no difference in spots or texture on my skin.After I was my face in the morning or at night....I put this on. It makes my skin feel good and moisturized but for the price and the amount of product that you get.....it‚Äôs just not worth it to me! I can use other products to make my skin feel moisturized for half the price!

Nothing special


I purchased this based on other reviews. Honestly, it did nothing for me and could be any nameless brand. It did not cause any issues with my skin but after 4 weeks I saw no change. I have moved on to some homemade serums so I know what's in them and I found a good night cream by loreal that I like better. I would not say it is bad, but nothing special IMO.

Within days of use I fell in love with this product. Over the course of a few weeks, the fine lines I had have disappeared and the deeper forehead wrinkle is less noticeable. I love the fact that the product doesn‚Äôt overly dry my skin and that the scent is minimal. Overall this is the best Prime Day deal I bought!

Tiny plastic bottle is so wasteful


I like this product and have purchaed it several times, but I'm annoyed (for environmental reasons) that the plastic bottle contains so little lotion. I am going to find a similar product that I can purchase in a larger quantity so that I'm not constantly buying little plastic bottles. LilyAna Naturals should consider manufacturing larger bottles of this retinol cream.

I FEEL LIKE THE PRODUCT IS A BIT WAXY.  I CAN FEEL A SLIGHT BUILDUP ON MY SKIN AFTER A FEW HOURS OF APPLYING.  IT DOES MAKE MY SKIN SOFTER, BUT NO VISIBLE EFFECTS OF RETINOL.  I HAVE FINE LINES AROUND MY MOUTH.  I HAVE USED PRODUCTS THAT I  PREFER OVER THIS ONE FOR IMPROVING THOSE IMPERFECTIONS.  IT DOES MOISTUIZE, AND IS PROBABLY SATISFACTORY TO OTHER BUYERS.

The face cream is good for daytime use but not enough moisture for night ...


This cream or the vitamin C serum, I am unsure which, caused me to have an allergic reaction which I wouldn‚Äôt imagine is the case for everyone because my MIL is using this cream and it‚Äôs working well. The 5 Stars is for her review of it and the company‚Äôs response.

waste free packaging


This product is wonderful and has evened out my skin tone and reduced fine lines. But what is even better is the way it is packaged. Most skin products that are in a sealed jar or tube leave a LOT of product in the bottom of the container when you ""think"" you are at the end of use. Not this package! I actually pried it open to get at that last little bit and was surprised to find that the bottom of the jar actually moved upwards as the product was used up. There was NO residual product left when it was really empty. Thank you for this great design. You have a customer for life.

Will help stop cysts!


I've had bad acne, hormonal cysts and red skin for two decades. Sporadic courses of antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide have helped keep some of it at bay over the years. My esthetician recommended something with retinol in it. I use this at night after washing my face. I apply a very, very thin layer, so thin, that is hardly feels like I applied any. If I use too much, and I get white heads. But, this cream has been so amazing! It's cut down on my overall redness and I haven't had a cyst since!!! Beware, the first 3 weeks, I totally broke out badly, and almost gave up using it. But suddenly, my skin improved.

Love this stuff. I'm 36 and always had really youthful looking skin, to the point people can't believe my 15 year old is my son, and I get carded to buy beer, lol. But after a really awful time last year, I was grieving the death of my boyfriend and all the daily crying gave me 11 lines on my forehead. LOVELY. I started thinking about botox and so forth. Well I decided to try something a little less drastic and ordered this cream. Do I look 21? No. Are my deep lines MUCH improved? Yes. They're still there, but relatively faint compared to what they were. So thanks for a good product that has helped me restore some self esteem after an already difficult time in my life.

Good product so far.


Just purchased this item a couple weeks ago. I recently turned 32 and was noticing fine lines on my forehead and my frowny spot. I really like how this cream is not greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft. I did some research on retinol and read that results don't typically begin to show until around 6 months of regular use, so I cannot say that my fine lines appear improved. Overall, I like that the ingredients used besides the retinol are making my skin free more hydrated. I can also say that I feel the tone of my skin has gotten noticably more even (I have freckles and a very pink undertone to my skin). I did notice some drying on my chin in a breakout area, so I have alternated nights until my breakout subsides. I will continue to stick with this product and post some pictures after 6 months of use.

I use this cream on my stomach and on my face and I have notice the change in my skin. It has firmed up and feels soft. I have purchased this 3x already and will continue to be a repeat customer. I only wish it came in a really big bottle because I feel like I go through the small bottle so fast.

Great moisturizer!


I really like this product. I've purchased this twice already. It's not too drying on my skin and while I'm combination, I do dry out easily. That being said I feel like it could have a bit more retinol added, making it more effective without drying out the skin. I like that it's a pump action, and that the lotion is pretty thick, it doesn't take much to cover the whole face. I will definitely keep this in my skin arsenal.

Good product!


I love all 4 of the products I‚Äôve been using from LilyAna Naturals! I use the Vitamin C Serum first, then the Eye Cream and then the Face Cream. Every other day I add in the Retinol Cream before the Face Cream. One thing I will say about the Retinol Cream, and this is probably just because I have sensitive  skin, but I can‚Äôt use it every day or my skin gets dry and itchy. I know people say you have to just push through that until your skin gets used to it but I can‚Äôt so I just use it every other day or every few days. Overall, I‚Äôve noticed my skin is definitely clearer and softer than it used to be!

I have definitely noticed the lines in my forehead decrease when I use this product. It's not a miracle for acne but it does help minimize that too. However when I used under my eyes they became really puffy and I looked like hell. My eyes swelled up so that made me look and feel really tired. I'm disappointed in that reaction because under my eyes are my problem area but this was just too strong for that area. But otherwise great product and will continue to use for my forehead lines.

Skin feels smoother, but hasn't done much for visible lines


I have very sensitive skin. Normally, when I switch products, I break out all over. For awhile now, I've only been using coconut oil on my skin, but it hasn't been doing much for the lines that I've been noticing. This has not caused a breakout at all. My skin feels smoother, but I haven't noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin which is the only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars. It doesn't smell, which is a bonus. I just wish it would help with the lines in my forehead.

I can't honestly say, individually, what this product is doing for me; but in combination with the other products in this line, which I use together, I love the results!  For the first time the milia on my face (small, hard, bumps beneath the skin's surface are disappearing.)  Before, this, they would not respond to anything I did.  They didn't physically show on the surface, but if you touch the area where they were located, you knew they were there. Now, they are lessening considerably.  Overall, my face is responding favorably to LilyAna Naturals.  My skin feels more resilient, looks smoother and healthier.  I am very pleased!  Thanks!

Did wonders for my acne


This is such a wonderful moisturizer. I have spent so much money on different products and treatments and still suffered from acne in my late-twenties. I switched over to this lotion and it was like night & day after a couple weeks of use. I love even more that there‚Äôs no harsh chemicals in it. The scent is very mild so if you are sensitive to smells like myself, this should not irritate you. This goes on light & absorbs well in the skin, does not leave that greasy feel some lotions tend to do. Love this!

Cheapest, highest concentration retinol product you can find


I got this product because they are honest about how much retinol is in it. It's 2.5%, which is also the highest concentration I can find. This is a great moisturizer on top of retinol product and I don't find my skin gets super irritated. Of course you have to follow the correct procedure as with any other retinol product: apply gradually to your skin over a couple of weeks to build up a tolerance and not get irritated, stop for a few days if it irritates you. Once you figure that out, retinol is an amazing product. My skin is more even, my acne is gone (even the occasional cystic acne I get) and the fine lines around my mouth and eyebrows are a little better (I'm 23 but have very fair skin and am starting to notice aging already). This product is cheap and gets the job done.

I don't usually rate any make-up type items but this is a game changer.  It is smooth and not oily or sticky, it does cause slight redness but that is how you know it works. My skin is smoother and clearer after one week. Also it makes a good primer for your foundation with a smell that is very mild/not noticeable.

Horrible for sensitive or acne prone skin. Worst moisturizer I‚Äôve ever used. I stuck it out with daily use for at least 3 weeks hoping my skin was just adjusting.

Great product, just be careful if you've never used a retinol cream before


This cream has really nice ingredients in it and can be helpful for your skin. Because it has 2% retinol, you have to be careful and allow your skin time to get used to it. If your skin is too sensitive, putting this on might cause you to get cystic acne. I had to start out putting just a little bit on a small section to see if I would have a reaction and worked my way up from there. Now that my skin is used to it, it really does tighten up the face and moisturizes it well.

I switched to this moisturizer from another natural retinol moisturizer.  This one is okay.  It does the job- keeps my skin in good shape, not dried out, etc.  However, I didn't really see any anti-aging effects from the retinol.  Also it ran out pretty quickly.

Sad to say, it smells very bad


I think the product itself is okay. I hasn‚Äôt changed my life, but it feels good (not greasy) on my face. My main issue with it is the smell. I see some people said it has no smell while others say it‚Äôs a bad smell and I am with the second half.I seriously considered returning it - thinking I got a bad batch. It almost smells like pee. I saw someone called it ‚Äúfishy‚Äù - I could see why they said that too. It‚Äôs not like I smell it all day, but while applying it I definitely do and I hope it‚Äôs not just that I get used to it and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt smell it all day. In the end, the bad smell is enough for me to pass on reordering it. Truthfully - I probably would throw it away but spending $20 on it is encouragement to fight the smell. I also have the daily face cream by the same company (Lilyana) and I love it! No smell at all with that one.

Not buying again. I have oily skin.


The jury will remain out.  I stopped using this product because I would wake up with an oil slick on my face every morning.  I have used brand named retinol cream in years past and did not have this problem and found it to be quickly effective.  But, I did have to be very careful with sun exposure.  This basically is not for me.

Great results at a great price.


This is my new go-to retinol. After spending lots of money on other retinols that were harsh on my skin and made it peel, I looked for an alternative. This product was highly rated on Amazon, so I thought I‚Äôd try it. I haven‚Äôt been disappointed. It gives me the same effects as the more expensive brands, but at a fraction of the price and without harsh side effects on my skin.

Pleased so far...


I've been using this retinol cream for almost 3 weeks now. I came across it by accident as I was searching for ROC retinol cream on Amazon. I do see a difference in my face in terms of brightness and a more even skin tone. I think it's helping with scars and my acne as well. I haven't noticed a difference in the fine lines/wrinkles around my eyes yet which is what I'm really trying to accomplish. I have since bought the eye cream and vitamin c serum because I like the retinol cream so much. I really hope that with continued use of all three products I will see a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. Thank you LilyAna naturals for fast shipping, great service and a great product!

Great moisturizer - great price!


I love this cream. This leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft. Typically in the winter I need a couple layers of moisturizer, but this Retinol Cream Moisturizer is good with just one layer. I have tried other Retinol products that have made my face peel the first couple weeks of using (even gradually using every other day to daily). I did not experience this issue with this product at all, nor did I have to gradually introduce the product. I was able to use it 2x daily from the start!  I was VERY pleased about that! I also love the container - no messy lids, or having to scoop product out. It is also very convenient to throw in my gym bag and not have to worry about spillage.

Best Retinol Product I've Tried


I can't say enough good things about this product. Most retinol products that I've used dry out my skin. This one doesn't! In my experience, I can tell a difference in my acne the next day and I see wonders in a week. I put it on every night when my skin is bad. When my skin improves, I alternate it with moisturizer. Don't forget to wear daily sunscreen when using retinol (you should be using it everyday anyway). Retinol and sun exposure do not mix.

Great product for a reasonable price


This cream is amazing. I am 64 and my skin has never looked better. I have used prescription Retin A, and this is nearly comparable. It will bring any potential breakouts to the surface, like Retin A, but that only happens for a week or so, then it helps to keep skin clear, as well as smooth.I also LOVE the dispensing jar.Keep making this reasonably priced product!

Great for sensitive skin


This is my first ever wrinkle cream but so far I feel there are many positives. Right off the bat there is no scent which is a big plus because my face is sensitive. I also feel it does a good job at moisturizering so I don‚Äôt need to apply another face cream. At first I thought it was making my face greasy but it took my face a week to become regular with the new cream. I plan to add the eye cream in to my daily routine as well. More added bonuses- the product is made in the USA!

Really helps with comedone acne! Makes skin smooth


I am truly amazed with this cream. If you suffer from comedone acne, please give this product a try. You will see results within a couple days. I saw a difference on the 3rd day. I have used this product for about 7 days now and my face has never been this smooth and clear. I have suffered from comedone and cystic acne for over 15 years. Having tiny bumps all over my face, like a rash, always made me feel so insecure. My face felt really rough and bumpy. But after using this retinol cream for a week, it‚Äôs made such a huge difference. I have been using it consistently twice a day as directed. Please remember to use sunscreen when using products with retinol. I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but this truly changed my skin! I love it!!

I was scared it would make my sensitive skin worse.


I wasn't sure what to expect when I started using this cream. My skin was a wreck from a stressful move, changes in temperature and water hardness. I'd had a rash from either stress or an allergic reaction to my new face wash or stress, but it was horrible, and I felt gross. My skin is incredibly sensitive to any kind of change, and I was nervous that this stuff would dry out my skin, or make it worse. I've been using LilyAna Naturals eye cream for a few months, and love it, so I thought I'd try more products from the line. (I have really sensitive eyes, too, and most creams turn them red for hours. This stuff doesn't cause that, and is awesome!) I've been using this, along with the Vitamin C serum for a few weeks, and my skin looks great...for the first time in nearly two months! I was incredibly skeptical, though...I read Amazon reviews before buying products, and always start with the worst; but I loved LilyAna's responses to any unsatisfied customer, and felt it was absolutely worth a shot. I love that these products are natural, and aren't going to cost me a fortune to look and feel good! I am very happy with my purchases.P.S. I can't attribute this 100% to these products, but I am pretty sure it's helped...A group of us went to purchase alcohol the other day at the store where the sign even says, We card under 30...My husband and his friend were not carded, but the cashier asked for my ID and said he had to get the manager's approval since it was out of state. I'm 38...I haven't been legit carded in a few years...This was the third time in two weeks. Heck yes, I'm going to continue using these products!

Light Moisture With Great Results


I love the Retinol Cream! I have oily/dry skin combo on my face so finding something that will moisturize but not lay heavy is crucial! I am prone to breakouts and this has certainly helped in that department. I've only been using it daily for a couple of weeks and I've noticed my outbreaks have subsided and my skin doesn't feel super oily at the end of the day. I was using old-school Olay before and I could literally see the sheen in my nose by 1 PM! I actually found out about it from a Buzzfeed article on FB about the top 25 Amazon items for that week. I also love that the bunnies are spared and that the product is mostly natural. Great product! I will have to check out the others!

I'm 33 and wanted to find a lotion for anti-aging. I bought this because it got such good reviews. I have to say I think it's a great lotion-not too heavy. Just right for my combination skin. I read that retinol lotions should really be used for 6 weeks before anti-wrinkle results will be seen. I've only been using this for 2-3 weeks. I have noticed a more even tone with my skin. Maybe some mild dryness the first week I used it but really not even enough to bother me much. I have been very happy with this lotion and will buy it again!

Effective and non-irritating Retinol Cream


I have been using this for about a month and I think it is fantastic. Just to preface, my skin is pretty sensitive, and it is dry to normal. I have used retinol products from the dermatologist before and they are way to strong for my sensitive skin. I love that this retinol product is already suspended in a cream (I used to mix the retinol from the derm in with my night moisturizer). It is nice and moisturizing while still giving me the results I am looking for. My skin is already looking smoother, and it is not too much for me to use every night, I have not seen any of the redness or peeling that can be associated with overuse of retinol. I also use it with the LilyAna Naturals Vitamin C serum. It is a great combination for my skin.I love that this is affordable and natural!

Heavy. Greasy. Ineffective.


For all the positive reviews on this I was sadly disappointed. I noticed no improvement to skin texture, tone or wrinkling. What I did notice was an increase in heavy grease on my otherwise normal skin and an inability to get rid of clogged pores on my chin and nose. Once I stopped using the product my skin returned to normal and the clogged pores have disappeared. The one upside is that the cream smells lovely and if you want a heavier moisturizer that works well under makeup this one did not seem to interfere with makeup if I decided to wear it on any given day. Would recommend for people with dry skin. Everyone else should buy with extreme caution.

i've been using this product for 3 months-PROS: feels great on the skin! my skin feels supple, stronger, very soft and smooth, and blurs my acne. made the skin itself look greatCONS: still have acne, didn't help with acne scars, kind of helped with skin tone but not a loti'm 21 and i've been struggling with moderate/severe acne and acne scars since i was 13. this product seems to help with the skin itself overall but not really with acne. i was hoping since it was an ""overall"" improving type deal, it would fix everything but it only really helped with my actual skin itself rather than the actual acne. besides that it feels really good on the skin, great for all types of skin i would say definitely including sensitive! improved the overall look but not for problematic skin. as far as wrinkles and lines, i didn't have many before but i guess i noticed a little improvement but not too much. would recommend to everyone except people with actual problematic skin. i probably will get this again to use around my eyes and neck but will start using a moisturizer with salicylic acid instead for my face.

You are missing out on great skin!


This is the best retinol I‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôve paid for some high end items when it comes to my face and this by far is the beat in executing what‚Äôs needed for the skin. I have skin allergies and sensitivity in areas but no outbreaks at all. I use this in conjunction with hyaluronic serum and i get SO MANY compliments.

Very Creamy and Moisturizing


This product goes on very nicely.  The instructions say to apply twice per day, but I am hesitant to use in the morning with concerns of the sun, so I apply only at night.  I haven't had any issues with sensitivity and I haven't experienced any dryness.  Also I appreciate that there isn't really a scent associated with the product.

Awesome results!


My daughter and I swear by this retinol cream.  Moisturize in the beginning because retinol will severely dry and redden your skin.  Use SPF so not to cancel the progress.  Works wonders for blemishes from acne and wears well under make up.  Works so well, we added a new subscription to replenish itself monthly.

This product kept me from breaking out, got rid of my acne scars, and has really been overall amazing. I've tried a bunch of beauty masks, micro needling, acid peels--pretty much everything. But this product was able to get my skin under control. I don't break out too much, but I have ""dark spots"" from old/new acne and this product really helped to make them go away.

Seriously, Amazing Creams


We were using Olay products, but now have completely abandoned them after using this Retinol cream and the Rosehips / Hibiscus eye cream. I'm not sure which of these is doing the job, or if both are but wow, my skin feels amazing. OK, I'm a 61 year old guy, no wrinkles yet, but some slight skin discoloration spots from the sun. I don't know what these creams are doing, but they seem to even the tone out of my skin and as funny as it sounds, I periodically touch my face  in disbelief because it feels so amazing compared to the Olay brand which didn't seem to do anything actually. I use the Rosehips/Hibiscus eye cream in the morning, and before bed, I apply the Retinol cream. I love both products and will purchase again. Please, LilyAna, don't change the formula like many of these mainstream greed companies do over time!

This stuff is amazing! I've been using it for almost three weeks and I saw the difference in my skin after three days. It really makes my skin glow and it's actually helped with my occasional acne.

It has also started fading an old scar near my eye. I have oily combination skin and it works great with it! Definitely recommend!

But on the flip side when I used this cream on my entire face it made me break out worse than anything ived used in years


This mosturizer was a double edged sword for me. First off I put this under my eyes every night before bed and HOLY COW it visibly reduced the the creasing and wrinkles under my eyes in a matter of DAYS and my under eyes were so smooth and plump!!! And my pores were visibly smaller too! But on the flip side when I used this cream on my entire face it made me break out worse than anything ived used in years! The formula is super oily and thick and probably clogged my pores. Sadly the breakouts aren't worth the great looking under eyes but I'll probably continue to use it under my eyes on occasion when I really need it but never again on the rest of my face.

Only retinol cream I can use.


I have this and the eye cream. My skin is definitely less irritated. I normally do bad with retinol but this is the first I have been able to use. The age spots on my skin are not as prominent. I use this right after I clean my skin with witch hazel. I can never use soap. So far my skin has been happier. I don't notice any smell with it. Just kind of smells like plain lotion which is good for me. I can't use anything with a strong smell.

Product  has a drying effect.


I found the product drying.  I only purchased it to get rid of two sun spots on my face to no avail.  The spots haven't even diminished.  I wouldn't recommend this product for total face immersion as it has a rather drying effect. I, now, only treat the two sun spots and not the entire face.  I'm a senior citizen with normal facial skin so I have no idea how others with different skin values will fare.  By the way, it doesn't have a scent which is good.

Can be a bit drying if you already have dry-prone skin


I want to see miracles worked (or just any difference at all) like so many people are mentioning, but I just haven't noticed a difference yet. My skin feels a bit stiff and dry so I think that I will begin using this every other day instead of every day. My skin in naturally prone to being dry so I've heard that normal to oily skin will probably not experience this. Also, be sure to wear sunscreen as retinol increases your sun risk.

I have to say, I wasn‚Äôt sure at first. I have extremely sensitive and dry skin that is acne prone. But after one day, I am in love. Overnight- the stubborn acne that I had decreased in size, and ran screaming from this retinol! It is very moisturizing, which is not what I was expecting. And I haven‚Äôt had to use additional moisturizers. I know that it all depends on how your skin handles retinol, but mine loves it, and I love this product. I have been using it about a week, and have seen a decrease in the number of new breakouts. And anything that IS new- is completely manageable in comparison to what I had before. Will absolutely be purchasing again.

Good value for the money


This is a very good product for the money. Retinol products are so expensive but this is well worth the price and I can tell  that it's working by the way it makes my skin tingle. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because although it's supposedly unscented it has a very slight ""fishy"" smell to it. I wish they would offer a scented version for people like me who like using products that smell nice.

I Don't Have Wrinkles (Yet), But This Does Wonders For My Adult Acne-Prone Skin


I never know when to leave 4 or 5 stars on something as I don't take the time to leave feedback very often. However, I will say that after over a month of using this product, I came back to leave feedback, and I will continue to order it as I personally feel it deserves 5 stars because of what it does for me.I've had oily skin since puberty struck many, many moons ago, and while I no longer require a prescription for my acne like I did as a teenager, the oiliness has followed me well into adulthood, and I still have flare-ups from time to time.This cream has made a difference in my face. I feel it really helps prevent breakouts, and while I wouldn't say I have any wrinkles yet (I'm knocking on 30 years old), there are trace fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes that I'd begun to notice before I started this cream. I feel like this keeps those from progressing and smooths them out some. I also think my makeup goes on better.This cream does not make my skin feel tight after application. In fact, the cleanser I use currently to remove my makeup at the end of the day tends to, and I put this on after to relieve that sensation. I don't use it every night, though, just to keep my skin balanced. I feel like if I used it every night it MIGHT start to dry me out, but I can't say for sure if it would. I just do what I feel is right for my body chemistry.If I see a breakout coming on (sometimes I'll just get one ugly cystic knot on my face), this stuff realllllly helps to dry it out and reduce the redness without drying out the rest of my face. The blemish will look better the next day and by day two (as long as I leave it alone and don't force it!) it'll fade or it will surface on its own and can be cleaned, then will fade. That might be TMI, but we all know how pimples work, and getting it to surface on its own without picking or trying to pop it can be hard when you just want it gone!This may not work for everyone, and I can't really attest to what it does for wrinkles, but I will say that for me, it's great at the turnover rate for acne without being harsh like some of the prescription spot treatments I used to use when I was younger. My face just feels fresher and smoother, like it's getting rid of all the dead skin. If I used it every night, I might not even have the occasional blemish, who knows!I recommend anyone with uneven skin tone or acne issues to try it as a moisturizer. It is 100% worth it to me at this price point and a little goes a LONG way. I use a little over a pea-sized amount for my whole face.

I like everything about LilyAna Naturals retinol cream.  It has improved the overall appearance of my skin greatly.  I am 76 years old and my skin wasn't terribly aged before I started using it, but my pores are now smaller, my lines are softened and it exfoliates very gently. It is extremely non-irritating if you have sensitive skin. I had been afraid to try a retinol cream but decided on this one because I like another product, the LilyAna Naturals eye cream, I was using.  I still use the eye cream with the retinol cream. I have purchased the retinol cream 4 times.

4.5 Stars


Hormonal, cystic acne only around my chin/jawline - super annoying. I've used prescription retinol products in the past that were effective, but left my skin pretty dry. I appreciated that this was largely ""natural"" and my oily-combination skin didn't freak out. (Have not used this during the winter yet, but we'll see...) A little goes a long way - one pump is generous for my face, neck and decolletage. It's really smoothed out my skin. Also, felt some hormonal acne coming along. This stopped it from progressing, and resolved after the second night. Docked 1/2 a star, because the harsher formulas usually nix it by the following morning. No peeling, no significant photosensitivity. Would recommend and repurchase.

I love this stuff!


This product was the only thing that cleared up my mild acne! within a few weeks my friends were complimenting my clear skin. For me, I am able to use this cream daily, but I only apply for my night time routine.make sure that if you're new to retinol, that you start slowly, applying once every other day, to see how your skin reacts. I think that since this cream is all natural, it really makes a large difference in how harsh it is on your skin.

Worth the price- very good product.


It does not really moisturize but that is bc it has retinol. It does a great job of removing dead skin cells- after about a week or two, you will see much smoother skin.The scent is not great, but again bc if the retinol.I would not recommend for sensitive skin.

Another great product from LilyAna Naturals


Another great product from LilyAna Naturals! My skin is looking and feeling great these days. The difference is subtle, but I think my skin is looking a little brighter and feeling smoother. I also like that directions are included. Retinol is serious stuff and, especially if you have sensitive skin, you might have to work up to putting it on twice daily. I've had it for about a month now and I'm putting it on once a day, before I go to bed. I would definitely recommend this product and look forward to buying it again.

Awesome face cream!


I've used this cream for 3 weeks now and really love it! It goes on thick, but I say that as a good thing, the consistency makes it feel really luxurious and substantial. I was most impressed with how well it absorbed, my skin soaks it right up, so for once it felt like a face cream was actually doing something! I've gotten numerous compliments on my skin since I started using it. At first I only used it at night and then after a week started day and night. I love how my skin feels with this stuff, super moisturized!(This picture is me bare faced, REALLY, after my night time routine: makeup removed with misceller water, clinique rinse off foaming cleanser, thayers witch hazel toner, and then this retinol cream.)

Getting rid of the dark circles under my eyes


Been using this for about a week, I get really dark circles under my eyes, just an EDS thing apparently. It's been helping with the purple/darkness under my eyes (which has never really gone away in the last 20 years) and helping with some skin pigmentation issues I had on my nose.  I'm awful with sizes and thought it would be bigger but that's my own fault, but so far working good. Going to give it a month and see how it goes before reordering.

I have been using this on my face and neck nearly every day for several months. I definitely notice less redness and more even skin tone. The best part is that my normally acne-prone skin has really improved. I rarely get breakouts anymore and they are never the deep and painful kind that used to occasionally show up.

It's the worst. I've been using this cream a little over ...


I am in my mid-twenties and suffer from dry skin, adult acne. It's the worst. I've been using this cream a little over a month and my skin is already seeing improvements! I will say that you have to be consistent with this, and before you start using retinol for acne, be warned that your skin will likely get worse before it gets better. Retinol makes your skin's self-exfoliating process speed up, so anything under the surface of your skin will pop up and your acne may seem worse for a little bit. But wait it out, keep using it consistently, and you will definitely see results. This cream is not harsh at all and I use it every night. Just be sure to wear sunscreen whenever you are using this and you will be good to go! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good retinol cream!

I have been using this product and the vitamin C serum for 1 month and I am blown away by the results. I have dry skin with cystic acne. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin's texture, my nose used to always be so dry I couldn't even put make up on it. Now all the flakey dry skin is gone! My acne isn't totally gone, but my break outs are less frequent and heal much faster, and I've even noticed my breakouts to be less painful. I was surprised how moisturizing the cream was, I've heard a lot of retinol creams will cause more flaky skin in the beginning, but not this one! I've gotten compliments on my glowing skin, so I couldn't be happier!

Purging & breaking out from this


I don‚Äôt know where to begin but I started using this about 3 weeks ago after my mother gifted this along with Lilyanas eye cream & Vit C cream. I seem to still be breaking out from this.I had skin that was actually decently clear prior to this but being post menopausal & wanting to brighten my skin up a bit and try to get a start on anti-aging skin care I decided to try it. I‚Äôll go 2-3 days where it seems to be clearing up than get a break out. Not sure if this is going to work out but am going to try to ride it out and see. I will update in another 2-3 weeks.

A Reliable Product with an Unpleasant New Smell


I have used this retinol moisturizer for a year or two and I've been very pleased with it until this most recent bottle, which has a very unpleasant smell. The formulation must have changed somehow--it's not scented, but this latest bottle has a definite fecal undertone to an otherwise neutral scent. That is, obviously, very off-putting. I'm going back to Amara Organics, which is basically the same product in different packaging and without the unpleasant smell.

Feels great on face & neck. It's not a facelift.


I use this with 2 other recommended retinol moisturizers from Amazon. Hardly any scent. Facial lines smooth slightly. Along with my Botox & Fillers I get. Paying for my sun worshipping now at 74.

Important step in my skincare routine.


This is the first time I‚Äôve used a retinol. (Should have started a long time ago!) I saw this on a You Tube video of skincare favorites so I decided to try it. It is not harsh on my skin. Goes on well and has no scent that I can discern. I‚Äôve been using it since mid-February and I definitely can feel the improvement in my skin. I am still on my first bottle but I bought a second for when I run out.

Works better than more expensive creams I've tried


Worked great. Left my skin soft but not greasy and absorbed quickly. I definitely noticed an increase in my skins clarity. I dont have sensitive skin, so I cant speak to whether it would be too harsh or not. There is no added fragrance but the product doesnt have a harsh chemical smell

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!


I absolutely love this cream. Where has it been all my life?! You see immediate results. After 24 hours I noticed my skin tone was just 1 tone! I had some sun damage and my forehead was darker as well as the bridge of my nose but not anymore! I also noticed any lines on my face and neck were finer than usual (day 3) I let my bf try this and he too loves it... in fact he always takes it when he travels for work. Buying me another one!I also got an email of the business owner, very caring humble people. Simply wanted to know my input on their product. Again, I recommend!

Great cream, great results!


I like the Retinol Cream and use not only this cream, but the face cream, eye cream & vitamin C serum too. I like the results I'm getting so far, but the scent of the retinol cream is a tough for me. It is unscented, but it picks up the smell of the plastic container. Thankfully it dissipates quickly . I typically add the lovely smelling face cream over it and it's all good. Totally worth the results though!

A Beautifully Hydrating Retinol Cream


LOVE this cream!  I am a sucker for Retinol, it really does wonders on my face.  I usually use the ROC products, but I decided to try this because I loved the LilyAna Pomegranate/Rose cream I got on an Amazon lightning deal.  I found that this cream penetrates and hydrates better than the ROC night cream I use, and my skin glows and looks so healthy.  I received a couple of compliments this week, after using this for about two weeks.  I really like this beauty line and plan to explore more from LilyAna.

Effective and Mild


I've been using this Retinol Cream for about two weeks now and am very pleased so far.  I started out just using it at night, but quickly started using it in the morning too as I had no negative effects at all.  In the mornings, after washing my face, I apply this with a couple of drops of the Vitamin C Serum together and they go on very smoothly.  My skin then feels simply amazing - so soft.  The appearance of my skin seems to already be improving some, and hopefully my sun damage dark spots will begin to fade with more use.  I am pleased so far with the effectiveness of this product and I look forward to continued use and hopefully even more positive benefits to my skin.  Give it a try!

I definitely would recommend this face cream to anyone who wants a fine product and will be buying it again when I run low.  Thanks for making such a greatface cream.

Mediocre


It's pretty heavy, and it made my forehead more oily than normal. I didn't notice any difference in my skin at all, and unlike most folks, I actually didn't like that it had no scent. :( I waited to review mine until I had used the entire bottle, but I'm honestly just not thrilled with it. Giving it two stars because it did ship fast and it didn't make my skin -worse-, just not better.

Yes ~ If You're Wondering!


Love this! After the first week I noticed ~ yes noticed ~ a difference. My mature face was not in horrible condition with deep wrinkles but I love being outside so I had some slight surface issues that bugged me. Little did I know what I didn't see. I have a new face. Healthy & vibrant and youthful. I'm at the 15th day mark of using Retinol and can't wait for a full month of using LilyAna's brand. It was a little too harsh to use 2x a day so I bumped my application down to nighttime only.After the first week of using the Retinol Cream I went ahead and ordered the other 2 products. LilyAna's Vitamin C Serum is already lightening the freckles on my decolletage from sun damage after less than a week. Don't spend tons of money on big fancy brands or cheapo ones either. LilyAna's are worth your budget! Its too soon to tell on the Eye Cream Moisturizer for my dark circles but the skin around my eyes is supple and dewy in the morning after sleep.You'll be happy you tried this brand <3

Yes, I love LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream!I wanted to wait until I‚Äôd used it a few weeks before I reviewed the product. I started using it every other night to see how my skin would react. I did not have any adverse reactions so now I used it nightly. I can definitely see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin.My dermatologist had recommended Roc, after some research on Amazon, I found LilyAna and preferred its ingredients- a lot less chemicals and organic, in keeping with my lifestyle and beliefs.Now I am looking for a daytime cream/serum (without SPF-which I am allergic to) that will keep me moisturized. Also an eye cream for puffiness. üòÄThank you for a great product!

and I feel like I am able to use less foundation


I've been using this cream for about 2 weeks. I bought based on the reviews and ingredient list. I wanted something with Retinol that wasn't too harsh to help with my enlarged pores, overall skin tone, and wrinkles. I must say, I have already noticed a reasonable difference in my skin. My wrinkles don't seem as deep, my skin is not nearly as oily, and I feel like I am able to use less foundation. I use in the morning and at night. I have not had any issues with dryness.

Ridiculously small amount of cream, waste of plastic packaging


Proportionally, the cream to packaging ratio is laughably small and I hate that all of it ends up in the landfill so quickly. One way to fix this would be to increase the volume of cream or change the packaging. $20 for a few oz is ridiculous.The product seems fine though. Just not environmentally conscious.

Love This Stuff


This cream is thick enough to feel truly moisturizing while still being non-greasy. When I ordered the product, I received an email that cautioned against diving right into daily use since retinol products can bring about some dry skin and breakouts when first introduced to your regimen. I still dove into regular use quickly and found that my skin did flake in one patch and a few pimples did emerge. HOWEVER, these things went away quickly and I think were merely an indication of just how well this product exfoliates the skin.My favorite part about this product is that my eyes love it! Which is saying a lot since they usually puff out like crazy whenever I expose them to a something new.Another great thing:  No fragrance!

I don't do many reviews.  When I bought this I was nervous because of the number of 5 star reviews for a product I have never heard of.I am 39 and bought this in combination with the Vitamin C serum to help with a giant patch of melasma on my left cheek. I broke out some in the beginning, but I stuck with it as other reviewers said. It may be my imagination, but the melasma seemed to start fading within the first week!  I am on week three, and the breakouts have subsided, and my skin is looking smoother and glows.  Melasma takes time, so I will update on that after I have used this for a few months.

This is a great daily product for shooting out the wrinkles in your face, reducing the eye bags, tightening the skin and making your face feel softer and fuller.

Absorbs quickly into skin and not greasy.


I have been using this product for a while and love how it feels on my skin.  I use it at night before going to bed because it absorbs into my skin and doesn't leave greasy residue as my daytime moisturizer does; meaning it doesn't show up on my pillow case.  That's a big plus!!

Clearer Skin, great product!


Love this Retinol cream!  I did alot of research as I knew I wanted a Retinol cream, but didn't want to feel like I was shelling out my life savings for beautiful skin. It was also really important that it had as many organic ingredients as possible and no perfumes added.  I have been so happy with this product, that I am now on my third bottle.  I have sensitive skin, and the first 2 weeks I noticed a few breakouts which I was expecting (this generally happens with all Retinol creams), nothing that would keep me from leaving the house though.  To me this was a good sign that my skin cells were turning over and pores getting really cleaned out.  After that my skin became brighter, more even looking and hardly a breakout since using this product.  I use it along with the LilyAna Vitamin C serum which I also really love.Products dispense easily, and fantastic customer service.  I'm 43 and my main issues were fine lines and sun spots, this has helped tremendously!

I purchased it because of the milia around my eyes - have not seen any change in those but it's only been about three weeks. It does make my skin's texture look almost instantly better, I'm not sure if this is just lift-diffusion because of the viscosity of the cream (it's quite thick). Warning: my skin did get flaky on my cheeks after about a week, I changed to every other day use and it went away.I will update the review in November or December.

I bought this Retinol cream a couple weeks ago, I don't use it every day, but sometimes I mix it with the Rose and Pomegranate face cream and it's perfect.  It's a wonderful consistency, thick enough to not run, but it goes on so smoothly and isn't heavy or greasy.  I don't have that many fine lines, so I might not be seeing any effect on them, but I have noticed that when I'm not breaking out, my cheeks seem to look smoother.

Ive been using this cream for several weeks now...I was worried at first because I heard retinol can make you skin very sensitive/dry etc but I wanted to get the great benefits of retinol so I had to take a chance and this brand seemed the most ""safe"". The seller was very helpful in sending an email after I purchased it explaining how to use the cream which I followed carefully. Your skin needs to be VERY dry when you put the cream on at night, not right after you shower (which is definitely a mistake I would have made) I use it every other night before bed and I do feel a difference in my skin, it seems firmer and brighter. I'm very happy with this product.

So far, so good - improvement after a few days


I'm in my early 30's and starting to be concerned about wrinkles around my eyes, especially underneath my eyes. I guess I've been squinting so much (I need reading glasses) the past couple years, that I have some permanent wrinkles even when I relax my eyes. The skin below my eyes is also starting to look really dry, even though the rest of my face is really oily and acne prone. So I did some research online and it looked like I needed to try some retinol cream. I also have some hormonal acne on my jawline that has shown up over the past several months due to a change in birth control, so I constantly have light brown spots from where the acne is healing, that take forever to fade away (""Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation""). I was hoping the retinol would help those brown spots fade faster, by increasing cell turnover.  I searched on Amazon and came upon this brand of retinol cream and decided to try it. I love the retro design of the label by the way.I've been using it for a week now, and I'm really pleased with it. I just jumped right in and started using it morning and night because my skin is NOT sensitive and I already use salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide regularly, so I knew this stuff probably wasn't going to ""burn"" my skin. It didn't even tingle. I wash my face like normal (sometimes I still exfoliate with apricot scrub if my skin feels grimy with lots of oil and makeup), then I use the retinol cream all over my face (including eyelids and lips), neck, and chest. After it dries for a few minutes, in the morning I use¬†
Neutrogena Naturals Brightening Daily Moisturizer SPF 25 1.7 oz
. By the second day the skin on my neck and chest was amazingly smooth and silky - I hadn't even realized that I needed help in those areas. I think my skin in general just has particularly slow skin-cell turnover because I tend to have thick dry skin and could exfoliate with the harshest apricot scrub and never have any problems from it. By day 2 or 3 I noticed the skin around my eyes was smoother and not as dry looking and my whole face looked shinier and smoother like I had exfoliated and used salicylic acid. By the way, at first I stopped using my acne creams/gels because I wanted to see how the retinol cream worked on its own. It did improve the jawline acne marks/pigmentation. After a few days I had to use my acne products again because I had a few zits that I wanted to get under control. I searched online to see if it was safe to use them all together, and some websites say not to because it can be too irritating, but like I said before, I have tough skin. So at night, after washing my face and putting the retinol cream on, I dabbed some salicylic acid gel on my zits overnight and I had no adverse effects. The next night I needed something stronger for the zits, so after I put the retinol cream all over, I dabbed benzoyl peroxide on my zits. I must have gotten some benzoyl peroxide on my neck, because it started to burn and I had to rinse my neck off. I guess my tough skin draws the line at retinol and benzoyl peroxide when it's on thin delicate skin, like the neck. But my face was fine, so I will continue to use those products together when needed.The thing that I like most about retinol cream, is that I can use it on my eyelids. Whenever I used salicylic acid or alpha hydroxy acid, I had to be very careful to avoid the skin around my eyes or I'd wake up with red, swollen, ""burned"" skin (same with benzoyl peroxide). Those products made the rest of the skin on my face look smooth and youthful, but my poor eye area was getting all dried out and wrinkled. I had tried a couple different eye creams without much success over the past year (Oil of Olay, and L'oreal). So, I'm glad I found this product, and I'm going to keep using it and see how it continues to work around my eyes. I mostly just use it on my face and neck now because I don't want to waste it. If my chest starts to look dull, I will just use it for a day or two to make it looks smooth again.

Any retinol will dry you out, but I really like the texture of this one. It feels a little bit more moisturizing and very creamy, which I like. It's soaked in a little easier than previous retinols that I've used. It comes in a super easy to use container and it seems to be bigger than a lot of the other ones I've used.

No Noticable Results, is there really retinol?


Hasn‚Äôt done anything after two months of use. No results and I will not repurchase. It feels like a very basic thick lotion which does not absorb into the skin.  Skin is left feeling tacky and slightly suffocated  Honestly, I would never guessed this has any retinol in it. The Korean retinol cream I use leaves my face glowing in the AM. I have experienced no such results with this product.

This my first review I‚Äôve ever done on a product! Only because this one is the only one that gave me results! First off, I‚Äôve struggled with acne and acne scarring since I was in high school. I‚Äôm 28 now! I‚Äôve tried soo many products to help stop my breakouts so I can start clearing my spots up. I‚Äôve even spent money on Roden Fields acne products. None of those products were consistent. It Would clear up my skin for a day or two then back to break outs. Some of them over dried my skin and left it red and irritated. Some did absolutely nothing. This one here did everything! My skin is soft. My pores are minimized and my break outs are gone! Now I‚Äôm able to focus on the acne scarring. When I put make up on I know longer feel self conscious of breakouts. I‚Äôm amazed with this product and will buy another when I run out!

I have repurchased this product three times. Honestly I first got it for my boyfriend and he loves it really helps his oily skin. I have really sensitive and dry skin I don't notice a big difference but he always asks me to repurchase and I can tell a difference in his skin when he used it!

Great moisturizer!


I have been using this cream for several months and I really like it! It‚Äôs a great nighttime moisturizer for my very dry skin. I never had any issues like others have mentioned and I have very sensitive skin. I gave it 4 stars because it all it really seems to do is moisturize and not much of the retinol benefits. I‚Äôm still going to continue to use it!

Cleared up break out caused by facial cleansing brush!!!


I changed my skin care routine because I was tired of seeing the sebum in the pores in my chin. I started using a facial cleaning brush which caused me to break out after a week of use. It was a shock to me, because I don't break out like that. Typically a pimple or two, but not a full on break out. I got this product and it cleared it up within a few days. Very pleased with that. My skin is smooth and soft again! I haven't noticed much of a change in fine lines under my eyes yet, but as it is recommended with retinol products to use for 6 months before expecting to see any change, I'm only one month in. Just ordered a second bottle with two other products of theirs because I like it that much. I wish it came in a larger size and that there was a way to tell how much is left in the bottle, but outside of that I'm pretty happy with it.

Great light cream with results


Great light cream for day or night use, I also like to use as an eye cream as the price is right and can see a significant difference is lines around the eyes. I was a little dubious about the pump bottle and was amazed to find almost nothing left inside when I cracked the bottle open when empty. Purchased my second bottle and will definitely keep using. Also great customer service and follow up from the small company that makes the product.

This cream has really helped the texture of my skin. I have noticed a more smooth appearance on fine lines and wrinkles. I have also noticed the size of my pores look smaller.

Will be a return customer!


This cream goes on very smooth. I've even put it on under my makeup when I know I'll be indoors. When first starting off I recommend not using it every single day (maybe every other day). I started using it everyday as soon as I got it and noticed my nose and chin started peeling a little. I'm not using it every other day and it's just fine. It does not irritate my eyes like most other creams do. There is no fragrance in the cream, which has been helpful for my sensitive skin. Will definitely purchase again!

This stuff is ok, after using it quite a lot I haven't noticed a huge difference, but I am only 29, so I don't have many wrinkles or anything, I just know you are supposed to use a retinol cream in your beauty regime. It does tend to break me out a little bit so I don't use it every night that could also affect the outcome. Not sure if I will purchase again, but I have recommended to a friend.

So far, so good! I'm new to using products with any retinol but as I am approaching 30 I have noticed some faint sun freckles appearing around the eye area. I have been using this for about 2 weeks and haven't noticed a huge difference in the spots yet, however I do see that this helps with brightening and evening my complexion so I will definitely continue to use it along with my Mizon snail repair cream and vitamin c serum. I love that this is moisturizing without being oily and has so many natural ingredients.I will also add that I have very fair, acne prone skin and this has not aggravated it in any way. I would actually say that it has helped with the hormonal breakouts. Would definitely recommend to a friend or family member!

It's a Nope for Me


This cream kept showing up as a recommended item for me so I finally picked it up when it was on sale.  Sadly, it just doesn't work for me for daily use.  I don't feel as if the cream actually moisturizes my skin.  It seems waxy, doesn't absorb well, and just sits on the surface of my face.  And it absolutely doesn't play nicely with my foundation--it won't go on smoothly over the cream no matter how I apply it (fingers, sponge, brush).  I had to just call it quits, remove all my makeup and start over with a different moisturizer.  I've used it sporadically at night or when I'm just hanging around the house, mostly because I'm cheap and want to feel as if I'm getting *something* out of my purchase, but I doubt I'll ever finish the container.I also didn't care for the pump container.  It's kind of a pet peeve for me since I don't feel as if I consistently have enough control over how much comes out; it's always either too much or too little.  And I also think a lot of product gets wasted towards the end unless you take the top off and dip your fingers in.  At first, I didn't even think the top on this container would even come off, but eventually I pried it off with some effort.  But who wants to mess with that?  (As noted, tho, I don't think this will end up being an issue for me since I'll probably end up tossing the thing before it gets that low.)A lot of people seem to really love this cream, so I can't say it's a bad product, per se.  Maybe my skin's too dry for it?  (It is dry, but not freakishly so!)  For whatever reason, tho, it just doesn't work for me.ETA:  LilyAna Customer Service did offer to replace/refund the purchase (see comment) so they do get brownie points for that.

No more cystic acne!


I've been using this product since February and experienced some light peeling in the beginning. I used to get about 2-3 cystic pimples a month; but after using this product I have not had any. Sometimes if I forget to use it consistently a red bump might start to appear but if I quickly apply the product, it will go away within a day. In other cases, if I apply too late, at least the pimple will turn to a small white head within a day. My cystic acne used to be painful and dreadful and I'm so glad this product has gotten rid of a major flaw to my face. I feel more confident and use less make up. In case it helps other gauge, I have oily and somewhat sensitive half Asian skin.

This cream is a great value- I had used the Neutrogena retinol cream for years, and this product gives you more product for less money. I think it works just as well.

I am a happy customer


I've been using the LilyAna Natural, Vitamin C Serum, Retinol Cream, and Eye Cream, for a week now. Normally I would wait a little longer before leaving a review, but I am actually seeing a difference. I am in my sixties and realize that nothing short of a face-lift will take away all the lines and wrinkles, but I have noticed a definite reduction in the size of the pores on my nose and I can't remember the last time my skin felt this soft. At night I mix 5 drops of the Vitamin C Serum with a pea sized amount of the Retinol Cream, that small amount covers my entire face with a little leftover which I use on the back of my hands. I've been using the Eye Cream as my face cream for daytime. Everything absorbs right in, no stickiness at all on me.  Oh, and the customer service is outstanding, they truly work to make sure the purchaser's experience with their product is a positive one.They have won me over.

Great cream.


I was concerned that this could cause excessive drying or a breakout, but neither of these things happened. Instead, I'm met with really fresh looking skin in the morning. It is not irritating and I didn't experience any of the burning that others mentioned, even though I do have very sensitive skin. It's a small bottle, but you only need to use a small amount, so it should last you quite a long time.

I have already recommended this to several friends as i think it is the one x factor that has helped improve my hormonal/cystic acne. I use a natural tumeric & neem cleanser daily, witch hazel toner, and then this retinol cream and my skin looks the best it has in  year. I still have occasional acne but nowhere near what they were. I haven't been in the sun at all and use a spf 15 moisturizer so i am not sure how it reacts yet but i will continue to use this.

It works and it‚Äôs affordable!


To be honest I originally ordered because I was looking for a real Retinol product that was reasonably priced. After I received it I used it everyday as instructed. I saw a difference in fine lines a the texture of my skin. One day my best friend said your skin looks amazing what are you using. I told her about this product. When it came time I re-ordered and continue to use it. I have brought expensive creams and serums when I catch an offer but keep coming back to your product.

There isn't a whole lot that I don't like about this lotion. It works well with other serums that I wanna use that night. If I skip any nights, it doesn't irritate my face. It doesn't burn on my exfoliating nights and I don't have a dry cracked feeling in my face when I wake up in the morning. I'm 29yr old mother of 2, and a former smoker.

Great Product for me!


I made this purchase based upon its retinol content.  I was skeptical but figured I've spent way more on beauty products, only to be disappointed, so this was a low risk buy.  The truth is that I've had this for about just over a month now and there is a noticeable difference in not only my skin texture, but how it feels. I'm 54, blessed with good skin and have minor wrinkles yet I can tell that my skin is smoother with fewer lines after using this cream.  I use this product as a night cream, after cleaning my face with witch hazel.  It's not greasy nor is there build-up.  All in all, I'm super pleased with it and will purchase it again.

I love it. I just turned 40 and I hate that, so I am working my best to keep a youthful appearance. After using this for about 4 days, I am loving how small my pores appear. So far, I've had a little irritation (which I was expecting) but I am still in the ""build up to it"" phase. For the price, I think this is a wonderful alternate to Retin-A and more gentle. I am looking forward to my skin adjusting and seeing the full force results - I'd recommend!

This retinol does what it says !  I've used many other brands over the years and this one is pretty good.  Don't like the pump for ending of product use, it's wasted and can't take the top off.  Price is too high for the amount, but like I said; it's what gets wasted at the bottom of container.  Lower the price of replace the pump and I'll purchase again and again.  Thank you !

Best I have found!


As a small business owner myself, seeing that you are a small business, making small batch creams in the US, was a huge selling point for me.  I absolutely love the products (eye cream, face cream and retinol cream) and actually recommended them to my sister in law, who bought all 3 too.  I passed the retinol cream by my esthetician, who was impressed that the cream had 2.5% retinol.  She is really fussy about what I put on my skin.  I will tell you that I found your creams because I was looking for an eye cream to use in addition to my daily moisturizer.  At 43, I was finding my makeup was settling into the fine lines around my eyes.  A makeup artist friend suggested that I get an eye cream to use.  Typically they irritate my eyes, so it has been a process to find one that doesn't...and yours doesn't!  The eye, face, and retinol creams are a win for me.  I will buy more when I run out.

A Few Days of Use


At 26 years old I've developed really dark circles under my eyes. I started using Retinol cream for a week and already I'm seeing slight improvement. The cream has no fragrance and I haven't developed any blotches or peeling thus far. My hope for this cream is that'll reduce the tiredness and dark circles underneath my eyes and I believe it might take a week or two for it to have a full affect.My skin is already feeling softer but as I said above it'll take a while for me to notice any significant results. I've been applying morning and night as instructed, and have been applying the cream three times a week. I only use a pea-size drop since it is a powerful cream. However I should mention that each person will experience a different results depending on how sensitive your skin is.I'll be reviewing the product in it's entirety in a few weeks on my own personal blog, I want to carry on using the Retinol Cream as it's already having a positive effect on my skin, it can only get better from here.

Started using this product a couple years ago and really liked it. I just ordered it once and stopped using it after it ran out. Once I stopped using it for awhile is when I really noticed how much of a difference it was making! I had to order it again! Now I‚Äôm on the subscription plan. It makes my skin look and feel so much younger and tighter. I can‚Äôt even see my pores when I‚Äôm using this regularly. I will continue using this retinol cream everyday! Thank you!

Great product!


I have incredibly sensitive skin and I have been very pleased with this Retinol Cream. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soothed. My complexion has gotten more even after using this. No harsh or irritating fragrance either! It is a bit thick so I tend to add a little bit of my Cetaphil moisturizer to make it easier to spread.

The only product you need


I remember seeing this product years ago and should have bought it then. I‚Äôve literally tried every anti-aging serum and moisturizer at this price point as well as much more expensive serums and creams but this is the absolute best. No breakouts just real results and smooth skin. I was using this on top of a retinol serum but I find it more effective when I use it on its own.

Actually works!!


This is great for those fine lines. I only wish I had bought it sooner! Follow the directions and don't get it too close to the eyes (it will burn if it gets inside them when your eyes water with those happy tears) and use sunscreen. It definitely makes the skin more prone to sunburn. I would recommend for anyone who does not want to spend a lot of money to look great!

Seems like immediately I noticed a difference.  I have an entire cabinet full of creams and kept saying I am not buying another, but bought this one after reading the reviews.

I had no benefit from using the entire container. Can feel the air in the container, so the amount in the container is deceiving. It smells good and works well as a moisturizer. That's about it.

So far I am very pleased with this product and I'm going to continue to ...


I've had this cream for about three weeks and I've been using it every other night to avoid dryness (as suggested in the PDF) along with my usual serum on the off days. The first two weeks there was little to notice, which I attribute to using it spaced out - but this past week my skin has been glowing and appears smoother. It feels softer than before and my patches of hyper pigmentation from acne scarring have seemed to soften as well. So far I am very pleased with this product and I'm going to continue to use it. I'd definitely recommend trying this product for a month before deciding if it works or not.

Best Retinol for Beginners


I love this retinol cream!  It's not too strong (only 0.25%) and it's great for sensitive skin: the first ingredient is aloe and it also has a ton of vitamins.  I didn't usually buy my skincare from Amazon in the past, but I had to make an exception for this one and I am currently buying my second bottle! I use it only once per day though (in the evening), unlike what it says on the bottle, or maybe every other day.

I waited a while before reviewing this retinol cream. I am 1/3 of the way through my second container of it and am thrilled with the results. I use this in combination with LilyAna Naturals Vitamin C Serum and the results have been  phenomenal. My skin has never looked better. My sun spots are hardly noticeable and my skin has an overall healthy glow. I wish I had started using this years ago!  Buy this & then buy their Vitamin C Serum, your skin will thank you! On a side note, I had an issue with USPS with one of my deliveries and contacted the company about it. The issue had nothing to do with LilyAna Naturals,  but they took care of it immediately for me. The customer service of this company is as wonderful as their product line!

I love this Retinol. This is my very first retinol. I used it alternate days with Shani Darden retinol.  I actually like this one much better. I had purging initially as i am using retinol product for the very first time and it is pretty normal.  I kept on using once a week and after few weeks my skin is so clear. I am still using it.  It is moisturizing . However I use Keils midnight recovery oil right after I apply this retinol for better hydration as my skin is very dry. I recommend this product. üëç

Helps with hyperpigmentation


Stunned at how this product has lightened my hyperpigmentation spots in just a couple weeks. I asked my doctor about laser treatments to get the sun damage (brown blotches) off my face. She said to try retinol first, because laser treatments are expensive. I work at an Amazon fulfillment center, and we seem to sell a ton of this stuff, so I ordered it and am so glad I did! I apply it before bed, just once a day, and the spots are noticeably lighter. I am using less concealer. My skin overall looks and feels healthier, smoother. I'm a believer.

I used the entire thing consistently every night, hoping it would minimize the early onset of forehead wrinkles (I'm 29). Sadly, there was zero difference. As far as a plain moisturizer goes, it was good at that and absorbed well. I will not be repurchasing and may look into The Ordinary retinol products

I am a male and on my third bottle.  I definitely saw results early on, with one slight breakout period.

I use it once a day in the am along with a CeraVie daily sunblock.  I wish I had started using this retinol years ago.  If you are looking to improve fine lines and overall skin tone, texture, I recommend it.  But stick with it, and I can't stress the importance of a sunblock to follow.

This is definitely moisturizing. I cant tell if there are any actual physical changes, but it does it's job. It doesnt smell like anything. I wouldnt consider it a medical type of retinol. Just moisturizing.

Natural retinol cream--yay!


So far, so good! I do feel a slight tingle when I first apply...which lets me know the retinol is doing its job. I especially appreciate that this small company sends you an email with more in-depth instructions (i.e.--you can put this on your eyelids, who knew?).Also: no fragrance is used, so for some this may be a turn-off, as we've been conditioned to added fragrances in skincare products, but to me this is evidence that it IS natural.I don't magically have a new face, but I wasn't expecting that. I do, however, expect gentle skin cell renewal. I'm happy to find products that aren't filled with petroleum weird endocrine-harming preservatives.

Loving it!


Great product for a really great price!  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now.  The base moisturizer is fantastic.  Sinks in fast and no smell.It's retinol action is more subtle than some I've tried, so the results are not immediate - but that also means I haven't had peeling and redness.  I can see my pores shrinking and my skin is glowing, so I know it's working!I plan to try more products in this line.

Really love this product.  I'm extremely sensitive and most anti aging creams that I've tried make me break out. Not this!

I love the packaging as well. Will repurchase!

Good all around.


I noticed a difference after the first day. My skin was brighter and smoother. A friend even asked, ""you're not wearing makeup? THAT'S your skin?!"" Fine lines are less visible, but still there. My blackheads have shrunk incredibly! Some pores have reduced. My skin definitely has a better and tighter texture.I did not experience any irritation even when used twice daily. My skin is also pretty tolerant so I can't say how it would be if you had sensitive skin.Just want to say, remember to drink lots and lots of water for good skin! (Like 70ounces and up) Otherwise don't waste your time with any product unless you're setting a good foundation for it to work with. Water is key to good skin!

I have purchased this cream multiple times over the years and will continue to buy it. It is a very good price point. I use it every night and haven't had any issues. It has no scent, has a nice texture feel and is moisturizing. I believe it has benefited my skin as it has kept me looking youthful. I am in my forties. I also love the packaging because it gets nearly every drop out of the bottle and keeps it sanitary because it's not a pot.

I never write reviews, but this stuff is amazing.  My skin is much clearer, softer, less wrinkled and younger looking, since I‚Äôve been using it.  I wish I had found it years ago.

This cream is not very invasive as compared to the ones i've used before. I do feel my skin peels a little after a week's of day and night use. It is not the aggressive peeling that leaves skin raw but rather a gentle exfoliation that leaves skin soft. I tested it around my eyes area just a slight because skin around eyes are very thin, and I'm pleasantly surprised that it doesn't cause any irritation.So far, I am pretty happy with this product.

I was using the product on my face and neck and after 2 weeks I started having a break out on my face and neck which i have never suffered of acne on my neck. I decided to give it one more chance but it did the same thing again, it irritates my skin and causes red bumps on my face.

This has a heavy alcohol base that is not good on beards or five o'clock shadow acts as an irritant. It does reduce wrinkles but it is not a good collagen retainer more like a drying agent like Oil of Olay. Not better than most face/skin creams as the amount of each ingredient is very small.

But after further research I've decided it's now time for me to up the dosage. I will be trying a clinical strength retinol (2%) serum next. I'd like a refund on at least one of the jars I ordered. Thanks.

Try this product!


This cream is truly fantastic. For years I would rotate moisturizers depending on the season, because my skin has always been so temperamental. After I found this cream, I haven't needed to do that. I use it morning and night, it doesn't break me out, my skin looks and feels the best it ever has, and I'm genuinely so happy I found it!

I‚Äôm a 25 year old female, so not TOO many wrinkles lol but I bought this cream specifically to help even out my complexion and minimize the appearance of my genetically larger pores around my T zone. This is now a staple in my skin care routine. I was a little weary at first because of how sensitive my skin is, but I had zero problems and there was a noticeable smoothness to the texture of my skin after the first week. Highly recommend!

I love how much brighter it looks


I have been using the retinol cream for a few weeks now and I'm really loving it. I use it in combination with the vitamin C serum and I've definitely noticed a difference in my skin tone. I love how much brighter it looks!  I have oily, acne prone skin and it seems to be working great and not making it more oily like some other products do. I've also noticed a difference with the wrinkles around my eyes, however I'm also using another new eye cream so I can't say for sure which product is doing the trick, but for the price, it is most definitely worth it. I will be ordering more when I run out! Also the customer service at this company is phenomenal!!! Very impressed overall!

I love this product, I have used a much more expensive line of skincare for many years, after reading some reviews I decided to take a chance, I am not disappointed, the product works just as well as the sensitive skin version of the product I was using for more than double the cost. I am currently beginning the face cream from LilyAna Naturals, so far the products are proving to be just as effective and much much more budget friendly.

With this cream and the JeNu Ultra Sonic (which makes the cream even more effective) I have to tell you, they are beginning to lessen in appearance.  The cream leaves my skin smooth and hydrated.  For the price, you cannot go wrong with this.

Can't run out of this!


I've been using about a month. I was skeptical, but? I do feel like the skin around my eyes and under my chin is tighter. I feel like it also feels ""fresher"", not as dry and seems to have more of a glow to it. So I bought another to prevent running out. I can only imagine how much better it will be in another month!

The new presentation doesn‚Äôt say if it‚Äôs 2.5% retinol


This is by 3rd bottle. I really loved the first 2. However I just noticed that they added hyaluronic blend on the 3 rd and one of the reasons I liked this retinol it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a 2.5% but the new bottle doesn‚Äôt state that on it. So I don‚Äôt know if I will see the same results now.

Gentle Rentinol!


I did not indicate Moisturizing qualities, as in my experience, retinol tends to dry skin. However, this product is very gentle! I used Retin-A as a teenager, and my skin definitely peeled. I have not had this side effect once in the three months I've been using the Lilyanna product. I have noticed a pronounced improvement in my fine lines and overall skin texture. I recommend!!!

I've only been using it for about 2 weeks but so far, I love it! My ""old"" routine: I shower every night, wash my face, and put on Cerave PM lotion (I've always used this and it's my favorite basic face lotion). I'm turning 30 this month and figured I needed to step up my ""anti-aging"" routine :) Now, I let the Cerave PM soak in while I brush my teeth and then add the Retinol cream on top before I get into bed.While I can't speak to the anti-aging benefits yet (as it's only been 2 weeks!), my skin is SO SOFT and smooth!!!! I love it and will continue to use it! <3

Just for their professionalism and keeping their word for refunding your money I would give them a four star. This product maybe good for some but it did not do anything for me.

Sensitive skin may peel if used every day - recommend introducing into skin care routine slowly


I liked the thick consistency of the product, and I could see a slight difference after just one use. However after about 4 days of using it once daily, I had red blotches all over my cheeks. I stopped using and the blotches went away, but the skin on my cheeks began to peel.  Of course everyone's skin is different and this may not be an issue for people who don't have sensitive skin. I would just recommend introducing it into your skin care routine slowly to avoid any adverse reactions like I had. It is a good product, just wont be an every day product for me.

I'm so glad I found this retinol cream


I'm so glad I found this retinol cream.  I have found that retinol has kept my skin looking youthful but the one I had used for years was no longer available.  After a couple of months without retinol cream I really noticed my skin was beginning to show signs of fine wrinkles and tried a retinol brand that caused a burning sensation. After two weeks without improvement in the discomfort, I discontinued its use.  Then I discovered this retinol cream.  It is light, non-greasy, and a little goes along way.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and works perfectly under make-up.  After only three days of using it morning and evening my skin was back to looking smooth and unwrinkled.

Works best when used every day


I like using natural retinols as opposed to artificial retinoids. I'm 41 and still get acne sometimes, so this product is great at keeping my skin clear and taut. It's affordable and has a very light, pleasant scent. Highly recommend for any age!

This retinol lotion is amazing. I have large pores and combination oily and very dry skin. And I‚Äôm very fair. This moisturized and even out the texture of my skin. It minimized my pores and smoothed out fine lines. Never irritated my skin. I think I have used three bottles and saw results soon after my first bottle arrived.

Incredible difference in my skin!


This product is amazing! I was dealing with breakouts and fine lines and this had totally transformed my skin. I've been using this product once daily for the past 3 months and the texture and appearance of my skin has dramatically improved. I rarely get breakouts now, just a few spots during my period, and when I do they're gone in a day or two. My skin looks plumper and well hydrated and I no longer see any fine lines. I'm 34 and get compliments on my skin constantly and have been getting carded a lot. I definitely recommend this product, the price is great and it actually works!

I am an avid user of Roc Retinol but after reading all of the good reviews on this product I decided to give up the Roc products and use this. After of using one week my wrinkles began to worsen, I immediately switched back to my Roc products and the wrinkles are getting somewhat better. I give this product 2 stars because it does work as a good moisturizer and they are allowing me to return the product.

I was patient and gave it time to work out the kinks...after using for a month and a half, I broke out worse than I ever have in the past.  The kinks didn't work out and I had to buy super pricey retinol to try and get my skin back in shape.  It has taken about 2 months to reverse the damage this product did to my skin.

This cream is amazing! The only reason why I raided the smell at a for a not a 5 is because it doesn't smell great, but it also reassures me that it is natural and doesn't have a whole bunch of artificial fragrance.

I used glycolic face cream for years until the maker changed the formula and lessened the quality.  That's when I started shopping for something different and tried this.  I had already tried the Face Cream, so I knew it would be a great product, but I wasn't prepared to have even better results than what I had seen over the years with glycolic cream.  This stuff really works!  My skin has a much smoother and brighter appearance and looks firmer.  I get compliments all the time on how smooth my skin looks.  I am 50 years old and I am on  my 2nd bottle of this stuff and I won't ever switch as long as the quality stays the same!

I've used this retinol moisturizer twice a week for about 2 months. It doesn't cause acne breakouts and the formula isn't oily or overly fragrant.

I may edit this to include an after photo. I have been using this cream at night, for about a week now. I have mild but persistent acne. I am 33 and have had acne on and off for 20 years, and was even on accutane twice. So far, this cream has stopped all new breakouts and is helping calm down the existing one. It's improving the overall texture and health of my skin. I love it and can definitely tell it's not just a coincidence, since I consistently breakout. I am also taking vitamin A, E, D, C and eat about 80% clean but still consume dairy and sugar in smaller amounts.

Use with sunscreen and a moisturizer and it is great!


A dermatologist recommended I use a 2.5% retinol cream so I tried this one on a whim wanting to look my best for a fall wedding I'm attending and I'm super happy with the results. This can dry your skin out but I had been warned beforehand and I definitely recommend a moisturizer and a sunscreen be used with this product. My pores are smaller now than they ever have been even the problem area on and around my nose. I'm in my early thirties and I dont think much anything works on established wrinkles but this really softens my skin so I can see how this can keep some wrinkles hidden or at least less visible if used before the wrinkles invade (I wasn't expecting my wrinkles to be affected at all and I'm happy to be wrong). This definitely reduced oil production which is why it can dry you out but worked wonders for my slightly oily skin. Might not be right for everyone but this worked well for me with drying being the only side effect I experienced and it was easily managed. It did what it was supposed to, no magic necessary. I was skeptical and wouldn't have bothered but a doctor recommended trying a retinol cream and told me an over the counter product is fine and this one actually worked for me. Good luck to you all.

Great product for sensitive skin


I find this to be a great retinol cream to use for people with sensitive skin. It's incredibly moisturizing and I don't notice any discernible smell (which is great because I hate smells in my face cream). I definitely noticed a softening of fine lines around my eyes and forehead. It's a win, especially for the price!

It'll probably work great for 99% of people


It moisturized well and didn't dry out my skin, but it made me break out. I have VERY acne prone / sensitive skin (did a course of Acutane eight years ago) and I'm on Retin A and an antibiotic, but the wrong product will still cause a flare up, and this did. It'll probably work great for 99% of people, but not for my type of skin.

Wonderful, but be advised that retinol *may* give you an awful headache like it did me


I'm sorry to say that it seems I'm one of the few who gets a very bad and ongoing headache from using this product. I received this on Tuesday and began using it twice a day, morning and night. I really like the consistency and how it softens my skin, making it easier to apply makeup when I do, and not leaving a greasy feeling behind. But by Friday my head was pounding.At first I thought it was the headache I usually get when summer turns to fall, but it persisted through Saturday and made it very difficult for me to concentrate on anything. I had to take Tylenol before bed because I was still hurting, and I woke up Sunday morning with my head splitting again. As I stumbled into the kitchen for yet another dose of medicine, wondering if I should head to a doctor, it occurred to me suddenly that I'd recently read a review about a product that gave someone headaches. A quick search of the reviews here turned up two saying that exact thing. I'm surprised because there's no discernible scent to the product (a headache trigger for me), and I've never had an adverse reaction like this to anything before. But I didn't use it this morning and my head has gradually cleared today, without need of painkillers.I don't know what ingredient is causing this, but perhaps it should be investigated. I would have given the product five stars if not for the headaches.UPDATE: Krista from LilyAna Naturals has contacted me by email to say they're refunding me for this product because of my experience, how awesome is that? And she confirmed what I discovered after posting my review, that retinol causes headaches in some people. I've decided to try another of their products that doesn't have retinol, and I've added two stars for great customer service!

I like the pump feature but would like an open jar or a twist off lid just to make sure I can use all the product that is left once there isn‚Äôt enough to pump out.

This is my first time using a retinol cream. I'm 35 and a busy working mom of 2 young children. I don't have a lot of time to care for my skin and I rarely wear makeup. I have combination skin and have been noticing uneven tones, dry patches and fine lines appearing lately and my daily moisturizer just isn't enough anymore. I don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars of a cream that only lasts a few months. I was nervous when I received the tiny bottle. A little goes a LONG WAY! I made a rookie mistake of pressing the pump all the way down my first use. It was enough for me, my husband and then I still had a lot of wasted lotion left over. I received the lotion almost 3 weeks ago and have been using it every other day at night as instructed. I have noticed a HUGE difference already. My skin is softer, moisturized without an oily, greasy feel. Though I still can see fine lines and wrinkles, the skin is plumper and they are less noticeable. I can't wait to see how my skin continuous to change with continued use.

This is effective while being moisturizing enough to use alone at night, even in the winter.

I have been using this product for about the past year. I actually lost my first bottle on a trip, and noticed a pretty big difference in my skin until I bought another! I have pretty deep acne scarring and this has really, really helped to lessen the appearance of those scars and close my pores up. I have super oily skin and this doesn't make my skin uncomfortably oily at all...I put it on at night and it leaves my face fresh and moisturized in the morning.

Loving this cream so far! It has barely any scent and absorbs quickly and is very lightweight. Using this in combination with a few other products and lifestyle changes, I have seen absolutely wonderful results! And I've been in a lifelong battle with acne and redness/scarring... The only reason this product doesn't get five stars from me is because I still have to moisturize after using this, but I have very thirsty skin, so not everyone would have the same issue, I'm sure.

Have only had thus for less than three weeks so I can't say I have seen any dramatic changes yet.  But the smell of the product is really not that pleasant.  Smells like mildew, or something similar.  Fades away after awhile, though, but geez, spend another few cents in production and add some kind of natural good smell, for crying out loud...  Update:. Almost finished the bottle, but the smell prevented me from using it daily.  For Pete's sake, but some fragrance in this product.

I am combining this with ginger and witch hazel drops to minimize the oil on my face as well. I love it. I will keep buying when I'm finished.

Love this product...


I started using the retinol cream to help lighten dark spots and redness on my forehead and cheeks, and it has worked wonders, I started noticing a difference in just a couple days. The pump applicator makes it easy to distribute the amount you want, one pump is enough to cover my face and neck. It does have a thicker consistency, but applies evenly and dries quickly without leaving your face feeling sticky, just soft and hydrated. Another big plus for me is fragrance free, so no lingering smells after applying. I use it as part of my daily routine and very pleased with the results. I will definetly buy again.

Great product


I love this product. I am in my 40s and have noticed a change in the texture of my skin. I apply this in the morning before my makeup and it has improved my skin tone and texture. It has reduced a couple fine lines on my forehead in just 2 weeks. Do not forget sunscreen since summer is coming. retinoid creams increase risk of sunburns

Got rid of my texture (caused by acne)


I really like this retinol cream. I‚Äôd been looking for a good retinol cream to help get rid of some of the texture on my skin caused by acne, and overall it really has helped! I‚Äôve been using it for about 2 months now and my skin feel really smooth, and my acne has rescued significantly! My only con would be that my skin is really sensitivite to the sun now, I use sunscreen everyday but if I don‚Äôt my skin gets really dry and has a mild burn (specifically on my cheekbones).

Good cream, works well for sensitive skin.


I think it's a good cream, I will keep buying it. I didn't use it long enough yet to see anti-aging results yet but if does plump up skin and works well with my sensitive skin.  If I notice that my skin is  a bit irritated, like from me not moisturizing it in time or overdoing cleansing or exfoliation, then i just skip this active for that evening. So far so good.

Did not affect my skin, at all.


I used the entire container and I noticed no positive changes to my skin. It didn't arm my skin, but there wasn't a change. I am prone to pimples, redness around the nose....I don't have any deep lines or wrinkles, but my skin is aging and I did not look any better (I'm 33).I have noticed, over this past month (the cream took a long time to use up), drinking water, quitting smoking for good, exercising, and using baking soda as a scrub/rinse (that really worked well) did the trick. I'm going to try another product. The ROC didn't do anything, either. I just want my skin to look a little better via something that costs money. Well, apparently that's a very tall order.

Ordered on a whim. Glad I did!


I ordered this on a whim when it was listed as a Lightning Deal. The reviews raved about it, so I thought 'what the heck.' I absolutely love this face cream. Has it reduced wrinkles? I can't tell; however, it has definitely evened out my skin tone and made my skin incredibly soft. I've been using Pond's Rejuveness for a couple of years now and it has done nothing for my skin. I've used this for only a few weeks and I've seen a noticeable improvement. I will for sure order more when I'm running low.

...as a spot treatment. I place a dot overnight on those raging and red pimples. When I wake up in the morning, the sensitivity to that area is lessened, though still present.

I purchased this product because I have had success with LilyAna products in the past and this was no exception. At first, I was nervous the bottle would not last very long as there is only half of the product than what the bottle appears to have, but it surprisingly lasted months. I try not to use everyday just because my skin gets used to products and then stops responding. I do notice this helps keep my breakouts at bay and moisturizes my skin. I would purchase again.

This has not had any real effect on the appearance of my skin but it feels nice and doesn't leave an oily residue.I'm sure there is a reason packaging-wise but if you look at the bottom of the bottle there is a hole... the bottom centimeter of the bottle is actually hollow.

This product caused significant skin irritation and inflammation of my skin. The product purports to be ‚Äúorganic,‚Äù but when reviewing the ingredient list, there are alcohols included. Using alcohols are likely needed for the formulation to chemically bind the other ingredients, but alcohol in itself is drying. It can also be an irritant. The list of ingredients is VERY long. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain which ingredient was irritating to my skin. Buyer Beware.I had a very good skin. After and before photos!

so far it helps with my minor wrinkles on the forehead within 3 days and tighten eye bags. My both cheeks are really sensitive so I only apply once in the morning already noticed it's not helping me reduce any redness but it didn't irritate my skin worse either.

Greasy and heavy, but hydrating. Not for me.


Even when using the tiniest amount, it made my entire face greasy and you could feel the product as if it were in a thick layer atop the skin. It did make my skin feel hydrated all day long and it never seemed to dry out, which was nice. But I can't get past the overall greasiness of the product. I also didn't care for the strong scent.

After one of my big pimples healed it turned dark brown and has discolored a penny sized patch of skin on my forheaad. I am fair in my complexion and it has been over a month and the spot is still brown compared to the rest of my skin. Maybe its because i didnt apply sunscreen?

Love My Lily Ana Retinol Cream


This is my 2nd container of Retinol Cream by Lily Ana Naturals and it won‚Äôt be my last. There is no added scent to this cream which is so important to me. My sensitive skin  never breaks out from this cream. Because it is reasonably priced I use it on my face, neck and upper chest. It is creamy rather than oily. My skin feels soft after I put it on. I have prescription strength Retinol A , but my skin gets very dry and irritated from using it . This LilyAna Retinol Cream I can use every day without irritation. Does this cream work? I have used it only a month now so I don‚Äôt know. I am in my sixties, so there is no miracle cream in the universe that is going to make me look like I did 10 years ago. But using Retinol Cream May help keep my skin looking decent.

I usually see results right away with a good retinol product. I was so bummed after the first few nights of using it but was determined to use it consistently for at least 2 weeks for a fair assessment. To my dismay, there has been no benefit at all. Maybe just slightly moisturizing, but no effects that I normally have with quality retinol-based skincare. Not even a slight tingle/burn upon initial application which retinol is supposed to create. I ended up throwing it out. :(

Thumbs up


I received this product on May 5th and wanted to wait a month to see how well the product actually worked.The verdict; works pretty well!After you buy this, the company sends you a PDF stating how to properly use it (so I advise you read it if you want the best results). It does dry out your skin a little at first if you're never used Retinol before, which is to be expected. After my skin had gotten used to it, though, it was so much brighter and I could feel the tightness in my skin as well. The small creases on my forehead have almost diminished as well, which is the main reason why I bought it, so it did exactly what I wanted it to do.

Thought I would give this product a few months before writing a review. I'm glad I did. The first few weeks, everything was well. My face seemed brighter. I liked the non-greasy feel of the lotion. No annoying scent. One thing I didn't like, was the container it came in. It would be nice to see inside somehow, so I would know how much product was left. It's a tiny bottle. Every time I used it, I was afraid it would run out.Fast forward 6-weeks of daily use. My face started breaking out in horrible acne. I'm 46-years old!  I looked like my 12-year old daughter (no offense, honey).Instead of twice a day, I used it once a day. Even skipped days to see if the acne would subside. Nope. Not until I stopped using it completely did my face clear up. Prior to using this, I would still get an occasional blemish, but nothing like this.I really wanted this to be my miracle cream.

I'd like it better if it contained essential oils such as frankincense, lavender or peppermint.  I'll likely buy it again though.  Not a lot of product for the price also a reason for three and not four star rating.

Meh, this is not a miracle cream but it works a bit. At least for me. I have to admit, I hate it‚Äôs smell, especially since you put in on your face so you keep smelling it until it goes away or you spray a body splash to hide it. I will definitely buy another one next time.

Honestly, I used it for a while, but didn't notice any change in my wrinkles or face.Maybe I need something stronger?

No results - does nothing for fine lines or wrinkles


If you‚Äôre looking to spend $20 on lotion this will probably be fine for you.  If you‚Äôre looking for an anti wrinkle cream (which I‚Äôm assuming you are since this is retinol) this does nothing at all to reduce fine lines and is a waste of money. There wasn‚Äôt even the slightest sensation if I used it three times a day which is a bad sign -if you‚Äôve ever used a good retinol product before you will understand.

Don't expect overnight results.  Dark spots didn't appear overnight so they won't disappear that fast either.  Been using this for 6 months and there is a noticeable difference.  I wish I used it sooner.  Doesn't even look like I made a dent on the amount of cream I used since you only need a drop or two.

Amazing customer service


I expected dryness of the skin, nothing happened, I expected a purging period, and nothing happened, I wanted to see if this would make any difference on fine lines, milia, acne, any at all. I followed the instructions I was sent, using it every other night, and then when I wasn't seeing results, I upped it to every single night, and then twice a day every day and still, nothing. That's not to say that it is a bad product, my skin felt moisturized, but not oily, and I like the company and the fact that this product is mostly organic, and i especially like the packaging, but given what a retinol cream SHOULD do, I don't think this delivers. However, I am curious to see if perhaps I would see a difference if I were to use this combined with the Vitamin C serum, because I have seen many people have better results with retinol creams combined with such serums. Perhaps the normal moisturizer would work better, if only because I would feel like I was getting my money's worth. I'd like to try something else from this brand though, because I would like to support them, so i'll look for my next purchase when I use up this cream!***EDIT***Customer service reached out and sent me the vitamin C serum free of charge, and when I combined that with this cream, the results were AMAZING. My skin is brighter, clearer and hydration of it feels more balanced, the customer service alone is reason enough to give these products a try!

I purchased this along with another eye cream product and found that the other product was more effective and gave better results. This product in particular did not do much for me as far as it being an eye cream. The one thing I will say that I love about this product is that I love how moisturizing it is! I used it both day and night and never felt it made me oily during the day, and when used as a nighttime moisturizer, the next day your skin does feel quite hydrated. Other than that though this product didn‚Äôt do much else for me.

I tried a few other high-end products that were ok,  never really saw any results.  I love this product. No irritation and my dark spots have lightened.  I have used this for about a month.

This product absorbs great into my skin and doesn't leave a residue when applying my makeup over it. It does make the texture of my skin better! I was hoping I would see a little more improvement in the deep lines in my forehead, but overall I am very happy for the price! The biggest win is not breaking out from it.

Best for beginners / learner guitar (considering the price)


As a layman (who doesn't know much about guitars) this product is awesome... It feels good, it sounds good, the strings are good... Before buying it, I researched a little bit and came to a conclusion that this the best (considering the MRP) beginners / learning guitar you can have. Ofcourse there are one or two things which may bother you once you learn more about guitar and chords and frets. But if you are just starting, this is the one to go with.

High action! Hurts fingers Might deter you from practicing guitar


pros:* The guitar has fair sound for its price.* Looks goodCon:* Action is too high, double of what is expectedAction is the distance between the frets and the strings or how high the strings are. If this is too high you would have to press very hard to get a good sound and this will hurt your fingers.Action measured at 12th fret was 0.5mm should be about 0.28mm, ill attach an imageYou might have heard playing guitars usually hurts the fingers but with this it hurts more than it should.As beginner this experience might deter you from learning guitar or practicing more.Learning guitars could be difficult but it shouldn't be a pain.If you are beginner buy guitar from trusted brand accompanied by someone experienced.

Just blindly buy it. Recommended ( Pro )


Writing a review after extensive usage for over two years. This guitar is absolutely one of the best buys ever. Rs. 2000 is an absolute steal. I have a Fender FC and a Yamaha F310 and bought this one since I relocated to another city for two years, and wanted a spare guitar I can junk.Guitar is in perfect shape and I won't be junking it ! Stays tuned for atleast 2-3 days with lots of playing (8-10 hours). Stays tuned afterward too but may need to fine tune. Tone quality is decent. Again, an absolute steal for 2000 rupees.Among companies like Juarez, most of their guitars are good but there can be a chance that you may get 1/10 pieces that are defective. Else it you get a well made piece, this is a great buy

About the best bang for your buck


I'm writing this a couple of days after delivery, and so far, I haven't had any trouble.Delivery-I'm very pleasantly surprised; it arrived within 24 hours as promised. Prime ftw.The packing was immaculate. A hard box, with the guitar covered and bubble-wrapped. The guitar bag was wrapped up in the box, along with the plectrums (0.71 mm), extra strings, and the guitar strap. The guitar itself was largely intact; it had a couple of tiny scratches, but they're so small, I couldn't even get a clear enough picture. It has metal strings and the knobs turn smoothly without resistance. Tuning the guitar didn't take long, and the resonance sounds pretty great.It's a simple sort of an instrument, without the frills of a Fender acoustic to adjust volume and tone, but for about 2k, with all the add-ons, I think it's an absolute steal.

Overall Review.


I have recieved this product and after analyzing the points are :-1. PACKING:- the packing was so good that there wasn't a scratch or dent on the outer part.2. CLOSING:- The guitar was enclosed in polythene, then a thick translucent white polythene cover, then by a cardboard box, first by the seller Juarez and over it amazon branding polythene.3. INSIDES:- there was a guitar, A cover, Two Pick 0.71mm, Guitar Shoulder Strap and 6 Strings.4. GUITAR:- The guitar was glossy, no scratch, no dent, no damage. CHECKED from all angles and with flash and light. The guitar received with fully precised packing and handling.5. PRODUCT REVIEW:- The strings were not tuned which is a good thing, you can tune as per your convenience. After tuning it sounds good, the eco and vibrations are quite lovely.Feedback:- If you are a beginer and wants your hands on a good guitar in best budget, this is what you are looking for. Buy it I will say.

Not worth it at all... Please read the details mentioned in this review.


This product is not worthy enough to purchase. It's heavily coated with paint to hide the flaws, however after 3 days of keeping it in the same cardboard box in which it was delivered the paint which was already coming out a bit, started to come out a lot on its own revealind the actual material used, the neck of the guitar and most of the material is plastic, not wood. I took the guitar to a professional who confirmed it and clearly said that even the sound from this guitar is not accurate or even close to 'accurate'. I didn't play it yet, took it to get tuned, and it turns out that it cannot be tuned properly as well. The strings even after tightening are loosing their grip and as a result after a point it will break or come out as per what the professional told me. Its not worth at all.. it'd be better to move it and go to a shop and purchase it in person. This is not for either 'Beginners' or anyone.. WORST PRODUCT EVER ORDERED! AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK.. I saved money especially for a guitar and now i regret ordering it..

I am a guitar teacher and this guitar is a nightmare


4 of my students already purchased this guitar before coming to me for classes and there are lot of issues in this guitar. For starters, intonation is really bad (which means 'besura' notes in layman's language) The bridge will come out after few months because the quality is cheap. One student has already faced this issue. There is no 'truss rod' as well which means there is no way to adjust action. And there are many more issues which a non-musician won't understand. If you go on OLX, you'll find many of this same guitar lying there to be sold 2nd hand because after joining guitar class and showing it to their guitar teacher, students realize how horrible the guitar is. A humble request for beginners - please don't buy guitar BEFORE joining guitar class. Your guitar teacher doesn't deserve that kind of torture to their EARS! ü§£ Ask your teacher first, and then buy. Don't trust your own judgement. Just because something makes SOUND doesn't mean it's good to use. This is more like a toy, not a guitar. Don't trust the reviews here as well. Majority of these reviews are written by beginners who have bad or average music-sense! Also, kindly upvote this review (click on the helpful button so that it appears on top) I am fed up of seeing this guitar in my class. If I see one more of this guitar in my class I swear I'll go crazy! Click on the HELPFUL button. I want every damn beginner in the world to read this!

Good to hang in your bedroom, not to play.!


I've played a handful of guitars before. This is the worst I've ever touched with my hand.!It's no good even for beginners. The fretboard is so small so that you won't be able to play any chord without annoyed by the fingers touching other strings. The action is extremely high which will result in not just pain, 'injuries' in your fingertips.And the main problem I faced - the low e string is placed out of the fretboard so it cannot be played at all. Refer the picture.The sound quality is fine and comes in a cheap packaging. But considering the quality of the product inside - that's fine.If you are looking for a toy or decoration for your home, you can choose this.If you want to learn or play a guitar, spend a little more money and get a better one

1)Packaging delivery was all good,It's good for money.But not recommended.I read the same reviews but was on a tight budget and hurry.Hence made a mistake.2)Even for a beginner don't buy.Only preferred for children for FUN PURPOSES ONLY.3)Every 2 weeks you need to tighten the strings to get the std sound.And the more you tighten it more the handle will bend to front side as the wood will not be able to withstand the pressure.Which is not at all good.P.S.-If you really wanna learn join classes who provide their guitar for practice and then with some more bucks have something authentic afterwards.

Not Preferred for Professionals


Well . If you are a professional u will probably not prefer this guitar .As the guitar stays in the fulfillment center for long with time the neck gets bentAnd there is no Trust Rod in the Guitar to adjust it .If you are a beginner who knows nothing about guitarAnd just want to learn it and isn't looking for a guitar for a long time purpose u can go ahead and purchase it .

Great guitar for beginners...


It is good guitar for extreme beginners. The action is kind of very high and you can feel it while playing. But the sound it creates is nice at this price range but if you have a better budget, go for other brands and dreadnought size...in small size guitar without trust rod like this it is very difficult to adjust the action. I have to taper my bridge several times but still my fingers hurts

Action is way too high. Not for beginners. Not for anyone.


Action (distance between string and fret board) is way too highAction is even greater than the distance between two strings.There is no truss rod so you can't change the action.I had to sand down the string rests on both end but still action is way too high.Not at all for beginners as the strings are way too hard to press down, and beginner would think that is how hard guitar is. pressing down any string with pinky finger is next to impossible.

Good for casual use only.


This is my very first experience with a guitar. After using it for half a year, here's how I feel -Sound quality: I honestly didn't expect the guitar to sound this good. And it didn't, at first. But once I tuned it properly... Voila! It's rich, it's full, and one cannot possibly ask for more at this price! (Rating: 4.5/5)Build quality: The guitar's lightweight and doesn't feel very sturdy, however, apart from a few dents incurred due to accidental collisions with other objects, it's still in one piece. Being a budget offering, it doesn't have a truss rod, which makes the neck prone to bending, but I haven't had that happen to me yet. The strings are of low quality though and had begun to rust within the first fortnight itself. (Rating: 3.5/5)Comfort: This is one area where this guitar is absolute crap. Especially for a beginner. The action - or the distance between the strings and the fretboard - is a bit too much, making it that much harder for a newbie to master the art of playing a guitar. Even if you're determined enough to persist with it, there's no way you'll be able to play it for extended periods of time - without inflicting serious damage upon your fingers, that is. (Rating: 1.5/5)Final verdict: This is not meant for people who are serious about learning how to play a guitar. It's for those wanting to take a 'test drive' before committing fully to that idea. Or, if you're like me and just need a stress-buster (of the musical kind) to help you unwind after a long day at work - this guitar should suffice. It's nothing more, nothing less. (Overall rating: 3/5)

This guitar is just about okay. Price is high looking at the quality.


I purchased this two weeks back and it broke the string while I was tuning it. This would be my third guitar purchase but this one for my cousin to learn as a beginner and while it has not bad of a sound, It does feel pretty flimsy. It broke the E string on very first tuning. They do give extra set of strings but of course. Frets are subtle for beginners not to get their fingers busted by strings. Other than that, I don't see my cousin moving around a lot with it as carelessly as one should with their instrument. Feels like made of very thin wood.

Best guitar to get started with. This is a bit small in size which is good for beginners as they can handle it better. Easy to play and sounds pleasing.Once you are good enough to play without looking at fretboard then good for better and bigger one.Made in china. Imported quality. Presentation is 5 star.

Best for Pre-beginners


I got excited about guitars after I saw a few guitar videos and tutorials. I was not sure if I can maintain my interest in learning and playing guitar. Hence without much investment, I was looking for an average quality guitar.This guitar does the job, although the quality is definitely at par with Yahama or Faith guitars. If you are a pre-beginner and wants to learn the basic strumming, fingering and chords, this guitar will do the job. Once you reach a beginner or intermediate level, you can go ahead with better quality guitars.You also get extra set of strings, 2 picks and an average quality bag.I broke A string on the very first day while trying to tune the guitar, hence extra set of string comes handy. Be careful with tuning.If someone is a pro and has used quality guitars, they might find this guitar below average. But for pre-beginners like me, it just does the job.I got this for 2200 but I have seen a few people buying it for 1900 to 2100 as well. If you are getting it under 2500, its a fair deal I guess. Also you can have a look at Intern guitars as well which are also for pre-beginners.Overall happy with the product.

This is not even a guitar, piece of junk.


I am playing guitar for 17 years and I haven't seen a Bad guitar like this one ever.  This is not even a real guitar. It is simply a toy. The fretboard is a joke. It was arrived neck broken, never mind.  The quality is awful too. It is very light, the neck was loosely attached and the wood was very bad,I need a refund, I don't want replacment.Simply don't buy it. Waste of money.Re. The situation becomes pathetic when the refund part comes, they simply avoided pickup telling verification failure and didn't also replaced the order.  Nuisance is going on here.

Think twice


I bought this guitar during lockdown oct 2019. It's kind of late as I'm writing this review (i have exams tommorow i don't know what Iam doing xD)So basically this guitar is a beginner guitar but in my opinion a beginner should not have any kind of Barrier blocking them to become a good guitarist and i think this guitar kind of makes the journey less fun, why? Because the sound quality is really very poor it also only has 18 frets, acoustic guitars have 20. It shouldn't really make a difference since you wouldn't be playing that high when first starting out until you reach 1-2 years.TLDR: try to push your budget a bit more and consider buying a dreadnought guitar. Iam altho very grateful for having this as my first Guitar, it taught me how to maintain my guitar.

People would think that it‚Äôs a steal at just Rs. 5000 but in reality they just steal your money. This thing is just a piece of wood with strings. 3 of them broke when I was tuning it for the first time, and it never sounded accurate.You can call it a beginners guitar if you don‚Äôt really care about the perfect sound and just want to get comfortable strumming and learning new notes.

Good guitar for 2000rs.


I was using this guitar for more than 6 months and I didn't found any problem for beginners.Yes it has some mistakes while making the guitar such as high distance between the fretboard and strings, dots on the guitar, total number of frets, hardness of strings, scratches on the body, small dent on body etc. But what you can expect to get in 2000rs.Still It is good for beginners who have small budget for learning the guitar. You can purchase this guitar for learning the basics and can use it for maximum 4 to 5 months and then move on for Yamaha, Cort or Fender guitars.

For 2500, this is a great guitar, sounds just nice


The first one that arrived - the neck was completely broken in to two. So before you receive the package, check package integrity. Mine was looking ok, but still I can see a dent marks in the neck area where the guitar was broken.Amazon picked my broken guitar and immediately replaced it with the new one in no time.When they picked the old one, I was looking for the Neck Band, Extra Strings and Strummer. They were not found. But then only when I got the new guitar I realised they were inside the guitar bag's side pocket. The moment I opened the cardboard box, I knew the neck was broken before I can take the guitar out of the box - just via the transparent polythene package.So thanks to Amazon for replacing it quickly, but at the same time, caution to those who are ordering this guitar to just pay attention to the package detail and inform the delivery person in advance. I don't think we can do nothing else but just give an attempt for replacing the guitar.

Not even for beginners.


This product is inconsistency in action. If two people buy this same guitar they can get different action that too with huge difference. The first time i got this action was 5mm for 1st string and that is too high to begin with. I went for replacement and the product i got for replacement had 6mm action. So I would suggest not to waste yout money on these kinds of guitar. Even if you are a beginner and if you can spend 2-3K extra then plz buy a good guitar in 5K segment. This I would not suggest to anyone. As the action is high you will face a lot of difficulty in pressing the strings.

Hi guys,This guitar is not a bad guitarOnly if you feel like you wanna experiment with playing guitarBut I do not recommend it if you're extremely serious about taking up guitar.There are amazing guitar s if you increase your price range a bit (maybe 4000 rupees). Because this guitar only has 19 frets and is extremely hard to okay because of high action. The tuning legs are of low quality and sound quality is average at bestPlease think about buying guitar s from bands like kaps, kadence or even Yamaha (the f310 is an amazing choice for everyone)Hope I was helpful.

This is my detailed review.ProsIt is very cheap.Good colour and attractive bodyConsI have seen many reviews saying that it is good for beginners. But it is not. It's action is very high and it will be difficult to play this . For those who don't know what action is it is the distance between strings and fret. It is very high which makes it difficult to play.Also it is getting out of tune very frequently.If you can buy a better one please do.If this your only choice then it's up to you

Unplayable - Action is too high!


Do not buy this product, even if you're an absolute beginner!I received this guitar yesterday and immediately learnt that the guitar action is too high. For those who don't know what guitar action is: it is the distance between a string and the fretboard of the guitar. While guitars are meant to have 0.2-0.25 mm of action ideally, the one I received had it as 0.5mm, making it unplayable. As a beginner you may not notice this right away, but playing anything on this guitar will be impossible for you and you'll wonder if something is wrong with you.I have ordered a replacement from Amazon, will update my review based on the replacement guitar.PS: you cannot adjust this without taking it to a shop, which will cost you a lot. It's better to just add a bit to your budget and get a better, playable guitar at 6-7k.

Good quality guitar... However the string quality isn't very durable .. the first string broke on tuning and when replaced by the extra set of strings ...It broke again... Had to buy from a music store... However... My guitar ""sir"" did say that the quality of the guitar was good except that there is a certain level of buzzing that the strings produced in initially... It did fade away with time.... and especially since it came with guitar case and picks etc... It is value for money. Only my first string has broken... The others are still intact... So hence giving 4 stars for this product... I would recommend it to beginners to buy it. Have been using it for more than a month now

Good product to learn. But packaging is Bad


The first guitar which I received had crack on its neck. As soon as I started tuning it the crack got widened up. So I asked for an exchange. Within 2 days I got exchange product which has a dent and small crack on the bottom part. I asked for exchange but they refused saying an order can be replaced only once. They are ok to give me a full refund by returning guitar. But I'm not sure I'll get an guitar with an offer price of 1700 in future. So I'm ok with it since damage is minimal and does not affect the tuning.Sound quality is goodStrings are not good. Better to change it with good grade strings.Product packaging and making is not all upto the mark. Guitar has cracks or damage in any one of the place.Overall a good guitar for a beginner untill he learns to play in a short period of time

For someone who wants to seriously learn, may be you can spend a bit more.My main problem with this is that the Fret to String distance(Action) is too much!The frets are almost flat to the board and hence you need to press hard.Its difficult to play Barre chords due to the requirement of pressing the string too hard.

The Action is very high. It's way higher than ordinary high. The Action is the gap between the strings and the base board.

Okay so I've given this guitar a 4 on 5 as when I received it the first time it's packaging was so bad and the guitar was broken from the neck! After 6 days of patience when  you'll get such a defected product  you can sense how it feels!!!But then I ordered for the replacement for the same and got it delivered at my place after another 5 days of desperate waiting and then I got the actual product  and it now it's on its wires!! A fabulous buy for beginners and good sound quality!!!

Its nice. Please check the product as soon as it is delivered because I firstly got a defective one. Ordered a replacement. The replaced one is fine and good but the there still remains disappointment as only one pick stick( Idk what it is actually called but the one with which u do the strumming)  is given with it.

Very bad, second string is so loose with no sound. I want to return it. I am returning, it is so bad and very dissapointing. Sounds coming from it is also not good no Matt how you adjust the string. It is pathetic excuse of a guitar, at least for a beginner like me.

Good choice for beginners.


Overall product is good for beginners who don't know about guitar and playing for first time & still learning.  I am writing this review after use this about 2 to 3 months.  ‚Ä¢ I received a good condition guitar.  ‚Ä¢ This guitar has no truss rod.  ‚Ä¢ Action(distance between string and fretboard) is high, your finger feel little more stress during playing.  ‚Ä¢ String quality is average.  ‚Ä¢ Guitar body attracts scratches more easily.  ‚Ä¢ Light weight guitar.  ‚Ä¢ Sound is good and not so loud because Guitar body is small and having 18 frets.  Can be a good choice for beginners.

Not a good guitar to buy.


Not at all good for a beginning. Trust me I wanted to learn guitar and bought this just looking at the best seller sign. But don't fall into that trap.It's distancing b/w the frets is wrong and the distance b/w the fret and the string is too big, causing more pain to the fingers...

Don't buy it


Please don't buy this guitar . After watching all reviews you will definitely think to buy it but Please don't go for it . Sound is ok But the most important it doesn't have truss rod . Means this guitar doesn't have it . So eventually this  guitar's neck will start to bend and you can't do anything . It will unplayable . I do big mistake to buy . Don't go on look .

A guitar for kids to play around


At a price of 1.9 k it's good for wannabes.The sound quality is average.The build is good for the price it is offered.The action (distance between strings and fret board is very high). Have to press really hard to get proper soundThe Allen keys option is not there. But at this price it's a waste to think about it.String quality is ok.In my view it's good for kids who are just beginning to learn guitar.

Perfect for kids upto age 10 and definitely not for beginners


Perfect for kids who are very much interested about the guitar and want to learn it as it is compact but for beginners I'd say not worth the shot. For beginners I'd suggest to spend around 5k or so and order it from Bajaao.com as they deliver the product with utmost care and the products are flawless. Best for people who wants to buy a guitar but unable to visit a store.

It's small guitar and sounds are not too good. Buy only if you want this for a child of less than 12years. Else invest in good guitar of yahma which Is more durable and sounds proffesional. It's not that good. But sitghting its price it's good only for children's who just want to have one but not for serious music lovers.

I had left my fender in US and bought this while I was in India for 2 weeks. Thought a cheap one would be ok. Was wrong. Terrible sound quality and not easy to play. If you want to learn guitar, spend the money and get a better one. Trying to learn on this is going to be demotivating.

After using it for more  then 8 months its a great guitar for the price lot of people saying its only useful in the first 6months of learning but you can use it as long as you want cuz i learned open chords and bar chords finger picking on it its great for fingerstyle and finger picking the high action makes it little difficult for finger pressing but you will used to it the sound is great for the price you can use it for years

Below promised expectations.


Action is too high as opposed to what has been described. Too thick strings that are difficult to play towards higher frets.  But it puts out huge sound/sustain. Overall , not a good value for money as promised (1500 vs 6000).Suggestions:Check the action/playability before despatch. It would up the value of your guitar.

Go for it if u want to know more about guitars


The sound quality is much better at price,you can also tighten the 5th and 6th string a little more to make it sound even better,but remember do not tighten the 1st(thinnest) string to much as it easily breaks. Even if the string breaks do not worry you can purchase more strings individually ora full set. The product has very high action,fingers hurt,but you have to bear the pain and become strong to learn it.

Bad quality; not recommended.


Returning the product. When tuning, the bridge is coming out of the guitar. Looks like a refurbished product. Not recommend at ll. High action is needed to get proper notes. Strings are so hard, so it will be highly painful for fingers. This would give a bad impression to beginner guitarists.

Don't buy this guitar. This is just a toy.


I'm a beginner and I thought I would not need high priced guitars for just practising beginner lessons and other basic stuff. When I got the guitar, I was surprised. The guitar had a good tone. I learnt a lot of basic stuff with this guitar. But the strings are low quality and the action is very high (the advertisement is false - almost 6mm at 12th fret and 3mm at first fret). You'll hurt your fingers if you play for more than an hour and you can't barre the strings completely because of high action. Even the fret heights are uneven. So, my advice is that you go for branded guitars like Yamaha(you'll get a good budget acoustic guitar around 8k). Please don't buy this one. You can't make any good progress with this crap.

I am new to musical instruments. I wanted to start with a pretty cool instrument and so I chose guitar.

If you are a first time buyer! Go for it!!!


If you are a beginner, this is an amazing guitar. Wondering why?? It takes time for you to know your guitar. You start learning -  how hard you have to press the strings, there are many scenarios where you just break the string unknowingly now, if you have have purchased a good one, it will cost you too much to change the strings etc.

Worth it for 2k!


This guitar is small, for beginners it is perfect. You can learn on this and then upgrade your guitar. This doesn't have truss rod. Sound is average. The guitar detunes frequently so you have to tune it every other day. The wood which Is used to make this guitar is very light weight and of cheap quality but what can you expect at this price range. I would give it 6/10 overall. But for ‚Çπ2200, it is worth it!

Hi, I got the product now, but the packaging was veryy disappointing, and moreover, the guitar bag that I received is such a bad quality, that just got holes and the chain of the brand new bag didn't even work. The tunes weren't set which I feel wouldn't be. Overall I am not happy with the packaging. The guitar looked beautiful though.

Dots given are wrong but a decent guitar .Good for begginers


This a decent quality guitar . But the dots on it are wrong.The distance between the fret board and string is 4.5 which a very good thing . Good for begginers.The bag given to me smaller than size of guitar . The picks are also of decent quality.

Plastic gears behind the tuning keys won't work.


The gears behind the tuning pegs are made of plastic which is a major drawback. And also one of it broke the second day while tuning the guitar also it won't allow the guitar to stay tuned for a longer period of time.

Quality is not good.It started breaking from back of it's fret board only when left tuned for a SINGLE NIGHT (see the pinned pic)NO TRUSS ROD, which is also lead to negative marking for durability.I'll not recommend you to buy. You can spend a little more money to buy better GUITAR.

It is a great product for the bigginners but keep in mind that it's frets are a lit more far away from the strings which could result in finger pain when using for long time and also it has only 18 frets.

It is quite light and easy to play for beginners but the strings are too fragile and might break easily. Guitarists who've been playing for years this might not be an ideal choice,for beginners it's okay as slides are a lot easier in this.

Absolutely Fantabulas



  First things first!!!!! The no-1 TV Stick in Indian Market...This 3rd Generation Fire TV stick has a superb build quality. The remote has a premium look & feels great in hand. The set-up with TV is just seamless. For normal size TV the HDMI extension cord is not required. If you require, it is inside the box, so not to worry :-)Now coming to the streaming quality. It is wow wow wow.. Dolby Sound quality gives a surround feeling & is great (I have tried this with my Sony 5.1 sound system though). You need to install the apps you want watch, like Hotstar, Zee5, Voot, Disney+, Hoichoi etc etc. etc. The Overall experience with these apps  are really cool. The newly introduced Live section seamlessly connect to LIVE channels via the installed apps.In the Verdict I will suggest if you want to convert your TV in a full house of entertainment & cool features, then you go blindly for this. Its the ultimate TV stick for you.

You cannot control volume of your Bluetooth device



  It is a really good streaming device . Apps work perfectly fine . You can sideload 3rd party app easily . Remote is fine , voice control is perfect , installation is simple , streaming quality is great.BUT WHY 1 STAR??you cannot change the volume in your Bluetooth headset or airpods which don't have its own volume control . Well i usually watch movies at night while others are sleeping so I prefer using Bluetooth headsets . Whenever I pair it with firestick It always plays at 100 percent and makes my eardrum tear and made me switch off tvThis is a basic function which can be included in a firmware upgrade , but as of 30th June , there is no update regarding this .So yes if this is important for you , u choose other streaming device .Btw i fall in love with their remoteüòç

Product not functioning



  I purchased the product in May 2021. It stopped functioning within one month. I requested for an replacement. The customer service execute informed me to buy another Fire Stick and will replace the one one once I purchased a new one. It is more than a week I bought a new fire stick and also informed the CC. Unfortunately there is no feedback from them. The old product was not replaced. Is it a punishment for me to buy your product and I have to pay for a faulty product. Please expedite.

Fairly good needs lot of tinkering



  Connected my airpods to firestick. And the volume doesn't work. Sound is too loud on the ears. Volume decrease on the remote doesn't reduce the volume in the BT airpods. Result sound too loud and jarring. It is shocking that a company of the calibre of Amazon can produce such ridiculous product. High time they come down from their perch of lord and mighty and think of ideas to give customer satisfaction. And on the upside I must say everything else is real good about this firestick

Never thought Amazon would cheat



  I ordered a fire tv stick 3rd gen 2021 during the recent Prime Fest of 26th & 27th July 2021. At the time of ordering the product detail very categorically said that there is a One Year free subscription to Sony Liv, ZEE5 & Voot bundled along with the product. This was in the description section of the product that I ordered, hitch was very promptly delivered to me. Now when I enquired with Amazon helpline about how to activate the free subscription, the customer support denied any offer like this & now I am supposed to pay separately for these subscriptions. How I wish I had taken a screen shot of this & kept with me. At least would have saved myself from the misery of being denied of what was promised to begin with. I don‚Äôt know how that promotion appeared there, could have been a technical glitch on the part of Amazon but I am sure I bought this with the subscription which is now denied. It a shame for Amazon to get so petty & completely disown the responsibility to fulfil their offer. I just feel cheated to the core.

Doesn't Support Voice Search



  The most important thing on which amazon in betraying us is that it doesn't supports voice search. For example alexa button is there but it can only play things on amazon prime video. If u open zee 5 or youtube you will not get the mic button to search and will have to press the assistant button which will take you somewhere else and will not search for things we want. It UI is excellent but this voice search is the main issue. Thats why you should be going for mi stick.

Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen, 2021



  I was forced to buy Firestick 3rd generation after my Amazon Firestick First Generation stopped working. It was working fine till afternoon and after showing Software update in progress, it got stuck and never worked.I called up the Executive and after trying everything was asked to take it to nearby center. As the center is quite far, I didn't go, but ordered the third generation instead.I wrote to Amazon, if they are selling the product, then they should also provide after sales service. They can always charge. No issues.The person should visit home to rectify the problem. Trust me, there have been instances when some Electronics company sent a technician to home, though the equipment was worth only 2000 Rs.And here we are talking about an equipment costing Rs.4000 to Rs. 6000.How can an equipment stop working while updating software, still I can't get it. Is that deliberate so that Customer buys the new version?Not to say, I regret buying the third generation Firestick. It's a great experience. Great sound. It's a marvel. Amazon always had been my first Choice.The only letdown was equipment stopped working during update. Never heard of. Amazon should regard loyalty.Almost Each day, can you believe it, we order something from Amazon. Please check records.

True review



  Quality of the product and packaging is really recommendable. I brought it at a great price of 2799. The stick supports maximum 1080p videos (I tried with my 32inch led). Sound is stereotype. Not tested whether it is dolby digital or not. It supports both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz of internet. Remote is quite handy. Alexa voice responses are recommendable. Interface is attractive and fast. Pairing of remote with the tv is done automatically on first setup and even one can set other consoles by going to add remote option which is available in the fire stick. Remote provided is RF type. One thing I disliked is the pressing of remote buttons. It should be soft press rather than hard press.I would personally suggest to go for it if anyone wish to buy.Thanks for the deal Amazon

  My Sony bravia non-smart tv has in-built Prime and Netflix app and few others but no Disney Hotstar. So I decided to buy this Firestick and ended up with out of the box experience! The picture, audio and streaming clarity this gave was far far better than my tv in-built apps!!!Plugged it in directly to my JBL soundbar which has HDMI-in passthrough rather than connecting to TV which gave crystal clear sound. Have to be patient for the initial setup. After that just relax and binge!! Terrific purchase!! Thank you Amazon for the offer pricing too!

Hardware still feels like there is a ui lag not snappy



  Mi Tv Box 4k at 3500 is still a better deal compared to this it's older than this but it's always been faster than my firesticks in terms of ui navigation.This firestick is not bad it does what it's supposed to do has a new menu system. All major streaming services work but I always feel that there is a slight lag on the user interface Amazon just bloats the home page with so many options I just wish I could just turn off all thr suggestions and that would speed up the ui. I just want to see my apps on the home screen not all the suggestions which is as is slowing down the ui and at the same time overflowing my home page with junk suggestions.

  I am giving this review again after using fire tv stick for the last 1 month. Previously I gave 4 star rating because volume and power buttons were not working due to videocon tv compatibility. But after some days Mr. Naresh(Technician team) called me and forwarded a mail to me for again remote setup and update. So I followed all steps as I received on mail and I am so happy to share my review again that now my fire tv stick is updated and all buttons are working finely. I m very thankful to Amazon for providing super best service and also to Mr. Naresh.. Product is really awesome. Go for it blindly‚úå‚úå

Inconsistence in maintaining Wifi Connectivity



  The device if connected with Wifi and detect internet, works amazingly. But the challenge I faced is that getting it started when I first connected it was a 2 hour ordeal. The device connected to my wifi but was saying 'No internet'. I have to reset the wire stick multiple time which did not work. Then I had do factory reset some 2-3 time, after which finally the 'No internet' error disappeared. After that the device worked fine for a month.After than again the Wifi connected but 'no internet' issue started. I have did a factory reset now, but the issue still persist. At the time of posting the this review the issue was not fixed. I hope it get fixed

  Fire tv stick 3rd gen is a magical device. Got this for my non-smart 2018 Sony TV.Streaming quality is 1080p max with Dolby Atmos. For Dolby Atmos you will need separate Dolby Atmos enabled soundbar/system to work.Supports all apps almost like YouTube, Prime video, Amazon music, Netflix, Voot, Zee5, Disney+hotstar, Apple TV etc. You may require separate subscription for each app.Bluetooth remote is very responsive with inbuilt Alexa button.You will require high speed unlimited broadband connection to run this otherwise it may not work properly.Got it on the prime day at just Rs.2099.

User friendly and extremely simple to use



  This device is something that I now regret not having bought earlier. Its super easy to use, more so with its voice control feature, which makes tuning into your favourite channel/music/video a breeze. I am using it with my old Sony Led TV (bought in 2011) which does not have internet or bluetooth. The experience is simply amazing. A highly recommended product even for new-age smart TVs because it makes toggling between different OTT providers super easy and fun. The only problem that I am having is connecting the remote to my TV's volume/power controls.Mine is a 3rd Gen, 2021 Firetv and I got it during a flash sale for a good discount @2699/-Tip: Watchout for any sales and jump on the opportunity.

Not compatible with SONY LED Tv



  First I bought fire tv lite stick which worked with SONY LED Tv 2012 model .But felt lite tv stick remote was cumbersome has it did not have volume,power and direct app buttons. Needed multiple remotes for smooth operation. So I went for 3rd generation fire tv stick which had all the buttons on single remote. But 3rd generation stick could not be paired with SONY TV after multiple attempts, changing batteries and lot of trouble shooting. Wish Amazon mentioned the names of Tvs with which this fire tv stick is compatible, it would have saved time and effort.So returned the stick and asked for refund.

One of the best piece of hardware that I have ever bought



  This review is for the 2021 version. Got it for ‚Çπ2400 in prime sale. Following is the summary:1. Easy to setup, takes time though (especially for the update(s)).2. Runs on fire OS that is a fork of the Android operating system, so the appstore might not have everything, but you can sideload apps using the debug option (although, not recommended).3. Screencast worked with OnePlus and Mi phones.4. Voice search works on YouTube and other apps, but using mobile to search through on screen keyboard was easier.5. Bluetooth devices work, you can even add game controllers.6. Streaming quality is great even on 1080p, I thought koryo TV's are bad, but this device delivered a great experience.7. Power button and volume buttons are mapped to the TV, the TV remote is useless if you are using Fire Stick, so for volume control and power, you will use this device, and you can tuck away the TV remote for good.

  1) cost in India and cost in USA too much  difference2) Hardware wise we need 2gb ram  and 16gb storage as minimum.3) inability to control Bluetooth volume from  fire stick is a deal breaker4) Inability to decode and provide Dolby  atmos via Bluetooth or HDMI is a Real deal  breaker. Should have opted for Nokia  streamer where in it is available.  My Laptop can do headphone Dolby Atmos  by buying the license from Microsoft store.5) Unable to switch off Samsung Dce32  signage display via power button on the  fire stick remote6) unable to select 1080 60hz or 30 hz video  on YouTube if it‚Äôs available when viewing  same video on laptop.

Works like a charm... installation wasn't smooth



  All that was expected - Turned my non-smart tv into an android one. As long as your TV has an HDMI port and supports at least 720p (HD ready) it should work. Otherwise additional gadget may be required.Setup was tricky though. I can understand why some people gave up and returned the product. Here's an advice:1. At first prompt choose eng US as language.2. After filling account details it shows an OTP to register the device. You'll expect an email or a notification in amazon app to provide the OTP. But the email/notification never arrives. This is the frustrating part.3. Go to amazon.com/tv (the instruction appears on screen) from your PC or phone browser to provide the OTP. That's it.4. My firestick kept restarting (rebooting) throughout the setup process and I had to re-start the task many times. I thought mine was a faulty stick. Then I made sure the HDMI connection and power connection were firmly secured (tightened). That solved the problem.

Garbage product - reviewed after 1 year of use



  Worked well out of the box, but performance markedly deteriorated within 3 months. After 6 months, was slow, laggy, unresponsive, and had to press buttons multiple times to recognize input. Drains batteries much more rapidly than other remotes, I need to replace the battery once a week now, and even then it doesn't work. Without doubt the worst, most overpriced purchase I have ever made on Amazon. Please don't be fooled by the positive reviews, most of these are people who are excited about the new product but haven't yet used it for a year.

  This is the best option to make your hdmi capable tv to smart tv.But after 7days at 18th October 2021, after I start fire tv stick it's home screen goes black. I tried all method like deregistration, restart, factory reset etc but problem still persist.At last 3rd factory reset black screen problem is fixed. Please Amazon fix it by os update.So this problem can't happen again. So this product may not be long lasting.Black home screen problem persist due to slow wifi connection or low ram/cache memory, so don't download too much app. You should save 3gb space to run fire stick normal.

Better to use the mobile remote app of fire tv to navigate.And something not right with hotstar as it gets hidden everytime on the screen.Definitely they need to work on the UI and maybe UX. Pretty average product I'd say with a great marketing and space to be in as a first mover.

My 2nd Firestick



  This is my 2nd firestick, 1st one I bought on 2019 prime day for 2199. I got this for same price. First device worked fine till 1yr.After that there was problem with sound, sometime sound goes off and doesn't come back. After some day, remote started giving problem. Frequent disconnect battery drainage etc.I had to replace the old one. You can only buy all Amazon exclusive products on prime day as the price goes lower than expected.New device has new interface, faster screen load, and improved remote. Since far all my existing problem are not seen in new one. Hope this one goes till 2023 so that I can buy 4th gen on prime day, ha ha..

Simple Smooth Streaming Solution



  I have been using it from more than a month and it is performing flawlessly. First thing i liked was perfectly packaged thing. Remote batteries dongle, HDMI adapter, charging brick. Second thing setting up was easy and full of information and text. The remote controls the TV as well On/OFF my VU TV was listed and there were almost all brands of TV available even the names which you might have never heard off.  Easy to install and the DONGLE is dual band can receive 5G and 2.5G wifi network. Streaming is super smooth no lags. The device itself is very powerful compared to the new  budget smart TVs that have a low RAM/ Speed processor. So surfing channels and using Alexa is breeze. Overall i would highly recommend to get this thing if you have a smart TV,Now all you need is just the remote plus everything hides behind the TV so no one can ever tell that the TV is non smart and has been converted :) For a full videos review you can check youtube video on my channel lightsky motion Pictures

Good initial impression



  My first buy FireStickWas skeptical to go for the older Lite version or the newer 2021 one since the price difference was significantWent for thisGot it delivered very late probably due to non availabilityWorks smoothEasy to set upBest part is they provide extension HDMI.Resolution is only 1080p so I guess a max 42inch TV I guess.UI is smooth.Remote is handy and works really wellA very good device for older TV who are not interested to buy a new one just for the sake of smart featuresI would recommend this productBut at 3999‚Çπ, it is not cheap as well

THE BEST streaming device... Ever.



  I have been looking for a good solution to steam various OTT platforms for a while. This one solves the problem perfectly.Apart fro usuals - streaming apps, games, platform support, I really like bluetooth connectivity now I can watch movies / shows without disturbing others around me.I dunno why I didn't go for it earlier.

IT was continuously throwing error and was not allowing me to sign in with my Amazon account. I had to call Amazon support after  which they ask me to do a factory reset post which it started fresh where i had to download all other apps, the earlier login user had gone and i was able to create my login and then eventually use my Firestick.

The set-up with TV is just seamless.Now coming to the streaming quality. It is wow wow wow. (with good net /wifi). You need to install the apps you want to watch, like Hotstar, Zee5, Voot, Disney+, Hoichoi, etc, etc., etc. The Overall experience with these apps is really cool.

Dhoom Dhamaka Product



  I have given a five star but will start from sad part. First I purchased firestick plus with zee5, voot and Sony LIV subscription. I got the delivery in 4 days. I signed in with my credentials. Everything worked super fine. The remote paired at first attempt itself. I was dilkush. But this wasn't last for long. I downloaded all files and checked pre subscribed packs. But the fate is it wasn't subscribed. Was asking to purchase it again. I contacted Amazon customer care. They gave few tips which doesn't seem to working with me. So I thought to return it and purchase without subscription (I could have kept it but since I paid 1k extra and was no use, thought of returning it). I ordered new one without subscriptions and got the item within 4 days(Thanks to Amazon delivery). Even now everything worked fine. I was worried on reading few reviews that the remote doesn't pair, but in my case it paired at very 1st attempt. Now there is diwali offer on few subscriptions where we get annual packs for low prices. Purchased zee5 for 500.So better not to waste on firetv plus and waste your time calling customer care(may work fine but it is just 2 lucky out of 10, where all 3 works good). Except purchase normal one and subscribe yourself which works all tasks in few minutes. Anyway the fire os is best and it is rocking . Dolby sound is plus point in this. Don't think twice just go for it without further thinking.

Best if there is an Atmos system



  This can to be used directly with TV normally. No issues work smoothly and video clarity. Audio is where it shines. If you have a Dolby or Atmos audio system this one nails with audio. In display and audio settings we have auto volume level and dialogue enhance. Normal pcm also sounding great. Dolby sounds awesome. If your audio system is HDMI arc and connected to tv, then this one firetv remote will control tv home theater and fire stick. For tv on off and volume control it uses infrared. Its a very intelligent way of implementation.

It could be better.



  1. It doesn't have option to change video quality. Once on a while all of sudden the video quality drops drastically so if it had video setting option, it would be great.2. It doesn't have many apps yet and also didn't see screen casting option. Because in latest TV's, once I connect it with Wi-Fi, I can add videos to tv list via mobile without disturbing regular mobile use

Great stick with very good Smart TV features



  I think This is the best TV stick to convert regular TV into a smart TV. Connect to a TV with WiFi password handy, it will do a rest of the things. Using nearly for a month now but no problems at all. Screen mirroring function is available which I think was not available in earlier versions.But only thing noticed that, as my TV is fitted on wall, it is bit difficult to put the stick in the HDMI port even with extension cable provided with the package. Will need bit compact extension cable plug to put in TV socket. Everything all good about TV stick.

One word to describe. ULTIMATE.. in bold and capital.



  I never imagined a product this nice and perfect. I mean, there is hardly any thing which is wrong or faulty.1. Works with any brand of LED TV as long as it has an HDMI port. Now even not so smart TV can be a smart Tv. If you have an old non smart TV, for a small expense, you can enjoy smart tv experience.2. Has bluetooth as well with which you can connect your headphones so that you can enjoy late night shows without disturbing sleep of person sleeping next to you.3. The Prime day sale gave this at a fabulous price.4. Though it works better on a high speed internet connection it still works satisfactorily on a mobile hotspot. With a 2 gb data, you can easily enjoy a full movie. It will be a bit lesser if you skip and fast forward the songs.5. It even plays Youtube. Keeping kids entertained was never so easy.6. One wish.. the case which is sold separately for 400 Rs should be a part of entire kit.Full Value for money .

Selling a batch of defective sticks.



  October 9th (Recent Edit):‚Äê-----‚Äê-----------------------I have received the replacements and both of them are working. The replacement procedure was a bit different than other items. The sticks were picked before the replacements came. I confirmed with the customer service representatives and they assured it was the case with Fire TV Sticks. Since the replacement procedure was hassle free, I am updating my ratings to 3 stars (Met expectations).October 5th:---------------Recently I order the 3rd Gen Sticks (Bundle of 2) for just 3.6K on October 4th and got them delivered on 5th, Perks of Prime member :D. All good so far!Unfortunately, all good things end here.I unboxed the first box, plugged into the HDMI port and followed the instructions to pair the remote. That's it! No progress whatsoever from the welcome screen. Tried everything suggested in the manual and support team, but in vain.  I was worried about unboxing the 2nd stick, but after unboxing it was like a ""deja vu"" moment. Both sticks are not pairing with remotes.After asking around with my friends and cousins, I found one of my cousin who got the stick on October 4th, also has the same issue.I explained this to the customer service representative, and he has arranged for the replacement. Will update this review after I get the replacement.

1st Gen stick performs better than 3rd Gen



  My 1st Gen stick catches wifi far well than this one. Also the 1st gen stick connects to bluetooth devices much far from it while this one needs a device thats not more than 4 feet away from the tv. Alexa doesnt work time and again and it says 'cant connect to amazon server try again later or call customer care'. Thus even voice recognition doesnt work well. Lastly it couldnt control my BPL led tv despite having bpl in its list. 1st Gen fire stick (now being sold as firestick light) is way better than this one. Dunno how is this an upgrade. If you wifi range is even slightly weak, it wont connect. But 1st Gen fire stick connects even super weak wifi from adjacent rooms without issue. Lastly, wifi will show 'no internet' (despite my internet connection working totally fine) once every 24 hrs and then we gotto turn off and turn on wifi on firestick again to make it work. Wont buy amazon sticks again.

  Perfect streaming device. But if you think that you'll install a JioTV app and say goodbye to your regular TV Dish then it's not that easy. Bcoz after installing JioTV, you've to control it through FireTV Remote and it's not an easy work as JioTV app made for your laptop & smartphone but you've no cursers or painting device for TV.Other than that, everything is perfect. You'll convert your non-smart TV into smarter one. Go for it.

Worth the buy.  üòç 4k vs lite vs 3rd gen.



  I got 4k for almost two years and was very happy with it. That's used for my TV and it's butter smooth.  Later I wanted to buy one for projector. As it didn't support power/volume button on firestick, ordered the lite on launch day. Was happy with that too but that was not fast as 4k.I was eyeing on the new remote with 3rd gen stick and what a better time to purchase than this.Now coming to this device.Quick activation. If you are buying for yourself, please check the ""link to my account"" . No need of manual setup..Streaming quality is superb and it's in full hd resolution as you all knowAlexa integration - mic symbol replaced with alexa icon. It opens apps/channels without a problem. Have been using that for longRemote. Wish there was hotstar/sony instead of Amazon music. Prime video/Netflix buttons are very useful.Only surprise ::  I have an old 22"" Del monitor which got HDMI input. Unfortunately it didn't give output on that. I was in the impression that it works on any device with HDMI inputs. As Amazon gives you a no question asked return in 10 days, you need not worry.I used mi stick and mibox before. There is a huge difference between them and firestick devices.Prices are never been better. Remote costs üòÄHope someone find it useful.

  I have smart tv at home and for second unit i am using Comcast but it is not very dependable and i was waiting for some solution to get ride of it .  Fire tv is more like mini android phone or having cheaper version of apple tv .Ui is awesome but stick is not that fast and kind a laggy ( typical android kind a thing ) . But can‚Äôt complain.One more reason to like it more is bluetooth support for headphones or earphones ( you can‚Äôt pair two headphones or earphones simultaneously)  With dolby digital plus watching HQ content is perk .Try to avoid 4k edition if you have smart tv or even if not now a day Smart TV available for 12-15k so not logical to spend 4-5k for stick only .

Very good streamer



  I have and am using mi stick.  This was for the second tv.  The Amazon prime part is very fast.  YouTube like normal speed.  Most other apps are there.  My major 2 cons are.  a). There is no instructions on how it starts.  It was prompting me to push a 3 dot button on my remote which was not there.  I randomly clicked some buttons and it started.  b). In the Amazon app in Android tv there is a move video button which shows the scenes much like YouTube.  Could not do that in fire stick.  But other than that, the speed is really good.  Will be checking more and updating.  Alexa assistant is a bit of a hit and miss and in my case more miss.  This inspite of me having an Alexa at home and that is working well.  So this was surprising.  May get well with time.

  The Best part of this fire stick is its wifi receptive mode and I do have 2 Sony Tvs and one is W820 Android latest one and one is old Sony tv of 2017, i found even the latest sony tv get defeated against this fire stick as this fire stick was playing such smoothly irrespective of Sony Android tv where default All OTT are there but was buffering a lot on my good wifi speed whereas on same tv this firestick was running smoothly.So yes receptive mode, picture quality, sound, all are as of now after using more than 3 months, its flawless.Dont buy 4k fire stick or fire stick lite.

Believe me, i am in love with the remote, its compact, works smoothly.Few people who complaints, thats why i would like to mention some points which i follow and then i am facing no issues.1. Your wifi router should be nearby to get the best speed and network.2. If you have 5GHz network then its really good.3. Alexa works fine but its very limited to certain apps.Also please when it will start for the first time, please have some patience, it will take some time to set up then from next time, its works amazing.

Stay away if you want to buy for Dolby Atmos as this device does not support



  Latest Update as of 27/12/21Have to reduce 2 stars I bought 2 Echo Studio speakers and paired with Fire TV Stick to get the DOlby Atmos effect, although the Eco Studio speakers support this Fire TV Stick does not support Dolby ATmos as claimed by Amazon. I have read each and every setting and had a conversation with many engineers form Amazon and got this confirmed. Please do not buy this if you want to pair it with any Dolby Atmos speakers. You will be disappointed like me.I have been using the Gen 1 Fire TV Stick with my non smart Panasonic TV since the launch of Fire TV Stick Gen 1. I recently purchased an Android TV from Panasonic and The OS was slow in responding and based on my experience with Fire TV Stick I thought of purchasing another Fire TV Stick to pair with this TV also because I am more familiar with Amazon Ecosystem then the Android / Google. It was a no brainer to go in for the Fire TV Stick with Dolby Atmos support because I plan to purchase Atmos Soundbar soon.The set up was easy like any other Amazon device however I was somehow not able to use the volume up down button with my TV. The workaround was to pair the bluetooth remote directly with my TV using bluetooth and then most of the functions worked and the TV could be switched off using the Fire TV remote but it could not be switched on again not sure why.The UI is simple and the response is faster then my Gen 1 stick also the boot time is much faster and hence I mentioned good device but not without flaws. Lot of R&D is still needed to be put in. Go for it if and only if you are keen on Fire TV Stick with Dolby Atmos Support else you would be better off buying the normal Fire TV Stick.I shall update the review once I pair the Atmos speaker with the Fire TV Stick.

Cheapest way to get dolby atmos content



  I have an older 4k tv which doesn't support dolby atmos,  but a new atmos compatible soundbar. Was struggling to getting atmos source till i came across this newer model of firestick that supports atmos content on netflix too. Even the 4k stick doesnt. I do miss the 4k stream but full hd hdr with dolby atmos is good enough compromise till i get a newer atmos compatible tv. Good vfm option.

  After some research only , I have placed an order for amazon fire stick, audio output is awesome which is equallent of real theater sound exprience if you use even mid level sound system also. I am using Normal Philips 5.1 system.. Bcz of this stick quality getting good output..Picture clarity also super and, also I like the firestick user interface and easy navigation along with remote Alexa voice etc.. .. Reason why I order this product is it has volume control + full HD support, my jiofi bandwidth support to stream Full HD.. as iam having good signal for jio, I am 100 percentage happy with this device, so I recommend.If you wanted get volume control and power button control select your TV brand or equallent option from setting tab, I am using this device 1st time and 1st day.. For 24 inch Sony TVIt is easy to manage..

Issue fixed. Combo pack Battery is not as per description



  Updated Review.Looks like it's a mistake happened from the developers who added a wrong product.Customer care team contacted me and asked me to order 8 AAA batteries and once it's delivered they have refunded the amount. So basically my issue has been fixed. Thank you so much Amazon.I got this product for 1999 rs for one 3rd gen fire stick. Bought this product since my second generation firestick stopped working after 3 years and repairing cost is1500 Rs.Orginal Review on 24th October 2021As per the combo pack description, two firestick and one set of 4 AAA batteries are included, but they are sending AAAA batteries instead of AAA batteries which we can't use anywhere in the firestick remote. Resolve my issue and I'll edit my review.

Great product in a great price.



  I was already using the Fire Stick Lite on my LED tv so the functions and interface were not new to me, I ordered this one to use it with my projector as I was very sure that it will work. I'm currently using egate 9 projector with Fire Stick 3rd generation and what a experience!! You can see the difference when you connect the projector with laptop and then with Fire Stick. The first difference you will notice is the picture quality and the second and most important due to which I ordered my second Fire Stick is the discrepancy in synchronization of audio and video while connected to laptop. Problem solved and now I can enjoy uninterrupted movies and webseries on 130 inch huge screen.

Chrome is good, fire stick is better



  I own a GoogleChromecast, and honestly, The Amazon fire stick was the best decision I've made. I've used chrome for 5 yrs now (1st Generation), the Amazon firestick I purchased it yesterday, so the review below is just a day one experience.@Chromecast vs Firestick#difference.- Phone V/S remote- limited apps V/S unlimited apps- online only V/S can download content and take it along anywhere- have to set up from scratch every time you change the wifi V/S need to only change wifi details#Common:- can create up to 6 profiles- wifi connection required (obviously) I have heard that you can download on the firestick and take it with you if you're traveling (not sure of this works)

One remote for all.



  A couple of years back my ordinary LED samsung television sound stopped working. So instead of trying to find someone to repair it, I decided to purchase a soundbar. However since then everytime we needed to watch tv, its been 3 remotes one for my existing firetv stick (5 years old before it conked out), the other for TV and finally one for the fire tv stick.With this newer generation firetv stick, the remote has integrated the power of the tv, the soundbar with volumen up/down and the stick intelligently!!  I didnt have to put any effort.Also so far the display is much better than the old generation. Must be something to do with using newer wifi technology in it.

Perfect tool to convert TV into Smart TV



  Got this at a cheap price during the Amazon sale during October 2021.Very easy to set up with the self explanatory guide. Takes about 15 minutes to update your fire stick and finish set up.The updated 2021 version comes with the new remote with which you can control everything, so much so after buying and setting this up you won't require your original TV remote again.The Alexa app does a decent job of recognising your voice and following the command.Stream quality is excellent.The only drawback or inefficiency is in the live TV button given in the remote and the option itself.It's meant to pull all the live TV channels from your subscribed apps and display them together so that you don't have to open the apps separately.But in spite of 'syncing' multiple times, fire TV couldn't sync and show the channels from the apps

2nd stick going bad



  This is my second purchase after previous one stopped working all of a sudden immediately after warranty ended. Upon calling I was asked to get repair from 3rd party for ‚Çπ1500/=.There was prime day offer and I got the new 3rd Gen stick for ‚Çπ2100/= and I said money well spent. I could not have been wrong. The new one is already giving trouble within 2 months of purchase. Yet to contact Amazon but quality is pathetic.I have old WDTV Live Media Player that's running since 2014 without any issues. Why can't Amazon build quality products?Please avoid buying.NOT RECOMMENDED.

  I have been using the Firestick for more than a month now. From my experience, I never had any lagging in Wifi streaming. The picture quality is very good. I rarely use voice recognition, but it is fine.Overall, I am very happy that ordered the Amazon Firestick, instead of another brand that available off the shelf.Straight away go for it, worth purchasing.

Poor quality product. Overheating issues started on the first day of use.



  This is my second Fire Stick and I am regretting the purchase. Had a poor experience with the first one as well.I bought the 1st gen Stick a few years ago - which lasted a couple of years and then it developed a personality. It would connect to wifi when it wanted and disconnected whenever it felt like it. Some days it would refuse to recognize the router (I have fiber FTH). And one fine day it stopped working completely.I bought the latest (2021) version of the First Stick to give it another try. On the first day, within 15 minutes of use, I started getting warnings from it - messages on the TV screen saying it was getting overheated (it is used in a room with an AC always on - with an ambient temperature at 25C or lower). I suspect this too will die in a few weeks of use.Sometimes you get what you pay for. Seems to be made of ultra cheap components. So no surprise that its performance is garbage. Avoid.IMHO, Roku is a far better value for money (my Roku from a decade ago is still working fine). You can play all the apps on it, just like the Fire Stick. But it is rock solid and you will be happy with it.

Amazon has created a gem of a product



  It works perfectly with yamaha home theatre. Watching movies is so much fun now. We had a Chromecast before this. And I must tell that this device is way ahead of Chromecast. No more fiddling with the phone to watch. Just one remote controls even my HTR.Plus the voice functionality is pretty intuitive. Even my 5 yr old uses it to watch rhymes. Sigh!!!There are still some niggles though. Searching for content within an app is tough. Eg. Search for a song in Spotify and it would start playing in Amazon Music. Is that by design? Well, everything else works fine.Also, you need to keep the remote coddled. It costs 2000 bucks to replace and that remote is the lifeline of this device.

  ¬†I was using Amazon Fire TV Stick 2nd generation. I was finding difficulties to open apps like Zee5, Sonyliv. It's response was slower and many times it gets crashed. So I wanted to try this new 3rd generation Amazon Fire TV Stick. I got in a deal at about Rs. 2000. I was reluctant to purchase it but after using it I was satisfied. It's fast as compared to last 2nd generation AFT Stick. Response to Alexa is also better.Only one problem what I am facing is that there is audio output problem when I use zoom (side loaded and updated). That was when I was using 2nd generation AFT Stick.

Good but need some improvements



  Good but some times Alexa says cannot connect to server try again so U need to restart it to work ...and it has problem of getting struck in Netflix mostly and restarting is only the option these issues are small but I believe they need to be rectified for better performance... Streaming quality is good ... I have reported the problem to call centre and they have sent me a new device in a day which is good ... So the service if fast and good ... But still have the issue with Alexa but the new device does not get struck during use... Must be some software problem ... But I still recommend firestick because of the service and all the other positives .

Good addition to convert your semi-smart TV to smart TV



  Helps to make your semi -smart TV to a smart Tv by adding a lot of apps and Alexa. I had been using the Fire TV 2020 model as part of Tata Sky Binge - first month free and then Rs.249 a month added to your Tata Sky DTH recharge. And to watch Netflix, Amazon, Zee5, Hotstar, etc. you pay separately ranging from Rs.499 a year to the same a month. Last month, I ditched Tata Sky Binge and bought the new Fire TV stick 2021 at Rs.3999 and the difference is that I own this. Functionally, there‚Äôs not any difference between the new and the old barring dedicated buttons fir Netflix and YouTube on the remote. Anyway, Fire TV stick is useless without subscription to the Apps mentioned earlier. The new TVs May not require this though. I bought a new LG Oled TV which comes with an additional Magic Remote which does all the stuff done by Fire TV stick + it acts like a computer mouse and better in selecting the alphabets when you need to type in your log in id for any app ( can log in using the same app on phone too without this trouble). I am using the Fire TV stick on the Sony Bravia bought in 2015 which is somewhat smart and Fire TV stick brings it at par with the new LG TV, well almostüòÄ

Simply Superb!



  This is my first Fire TV Stick. Got it at a great price and perfect time at Amazon sale. This is my review after 15 days of use.Installation and initial setup was very simple and connected to my BSNL fibre broadband wifi in a jiffy. It also works well with mobile hotspot. But to enjoy streaming to the fullest better to have fibre broadband.The new UI is absolutely fantastic with smooth and fluid interface. Browsing experience is fantastic too.All major apps are available in app store. Streaming is top class without any lag or buffer with outstanding picture quality. Switching between apps is also lag-free.Alexa remote is just superb with perfect voice recognition on my first ever attempt.Simply go for it.

Bluetooth audio, voice recognition, streaming great



  Must buy if you find it under 2500 again.I got free prime subscription for 3 months as well.Few points:1. Always purchase this version. Dont buy lite version. I returned lite version. Reason is bluetooth audio. Lite version has very low bluetooth audio and you can not even hear dialogues.  This version of sticks has volume controls for bluetooth devices with latest firmware update so you can use fire stick remote to control your bluetooth headphone/soundbar audio. Trust me this helps a lot. Please update firestick bios to use this feature.2. Voice recognition on this version is very great and works on all apps.3. If you are connecting with aux cable or want to is TV Audio, please use PCM onlyoption fron audio settings on stick.4. If your bluetooth headphone/ soundbar has Bluetooth 5.0 then there is no lag in audio while watching movies. You can blindly purchase this stick as this has bluetooth version 5.0.  Other sticks like Mi and realme has bluetooth 4.0 which results in audio lag.I am using it with projector with soundbar and I am getting true theatre like feeling no doubt.

Smooth setup



  Plug and use.Super-friendly, highly responsive, intuitive UIüëç that one might not have expected from FireOS!The Fire stick updates itself and provides for apps like Disney+Hotstar, SunNxt, Netflix, Zee5, Amazon prime video and many more from its own store.Some of the apps are free, to download as well as for streaming a few free shows/movies, while the more popular apps are free to download but subscription based.The remote is brilliant and if you have connected your Amazon account with any Alexa-enabled device then it picks up your WiFi automatically as is with all Alexa devices.Voice recognition is not 5 star but pretty good.Value for money purchase if your mom or family members are into watching serials and sitcoms as they could simply pause the show at any point, watch another serial episode and return to the paused show.

Awesome product. Very happy.



  I got this latest generation fire stick on a discounted price. Installation was very easy. Easy to use. It makes our normal TV a smart TV. Streaming is very smooth. I really impressed with the improved sound quality with the same 5.1 speakers which I use with other media devices. Though my home theatre is not compatible with Dolby DTS or Dolby Atmos but stil I can notice the improved sound quality when I listen anything using fire stick in compared to playing with mobile/laptop/setup box devices. Very satisfied with the product.

The remote is not pairing with the firestick at all. I have tried every solution; changing batteries even though the product is brand new, factory resetting the remote, fire tv app, and all other ways available online. Nothing seems to work. Since remote is not pairing up with the device, it is also not proceeding further. I have no menu, no options left. I have spent a whole day trying to set it up. I am not going to waste anymore time because this is a device which is supposed to have a simple setup with most of the functions done automatically. There is no replacement option available for it. I am just going to return this firestick and try other products available in the market.

  Fire Sticks have existed now for more than a couple of years and are quite popular. So my decision to buy one is quite late, since we had become quite accustomed to streaming everything on our laptops and haven‚Äôt bought a TV which we firmly believe is an absolute idiot box. Having said this, I‚Äôm using the Fire Stick on a computer monitor and it is an absolutely fine buy, I must admit. If I ever buy a TV it‚Äôll only be for the Fire Stick and nothing else. Will not be commenting on the functionality because many before me would have said much more. All I would want to say is that it is a really good buy for the family.

Once i put in the new batteries, the remote was working absolutely fine once again. Even the buttons that Had stopped working were absolutely fine.Therefore, long story short - just replace the batteries if few  buttons on your remote stop working.

Excellent Product



  Excellent product even if you are not subscribing for any channels like Amazon Prime or Net Flix etc. I have been using it only for watching programs in You Tube and Alexa listens and Comprehends easily. If she fails, even if you give spelling, she will search and display the programs. Even though my TV screen quality is not upto the mark, somehow, the Stick is able to give me best picture quality in streaming. This is amazing. I saw my relative family using this for showing Tenali Ramakrishna stories in You Tube and I recommended this Stick to my team for watching various You Tube Trainings on technical subjects, BPMN training and BPM training etc., The effect will be amazing.Note: If the stick fails, you will end-up paying another INR 2000 for its replacement. Hence, please download their app (while the stick is working) on another dummy smart phone and if the stick crashes, you will have a back-up.

Home theater and bluetooth audio does not work



  The device is good in terms of streaming quality but I have an issue with audio. It has a feature called home theater where you can connect the stick and your Echo, but whenever I do that, the device always freezes. Tech support already replaced id twice but the same issue on all the replacements as well. They say that the device is disconnecting from network, of course it disconnects cause when it freezes it is  no longer connected to wifi. Sometimes they tell its my Echo and some times they tell its the fire stick. I factory reset my router, echo and the fire stick multiple times and I just gave up on this. Tech support says they will call back with an update but they never do, pathetic service by Amazon.Then I thought I would connect the fire stick via Bluetooth to the echo, guess what that also does not work. The audio is barely audible even at maximum level, when contacting the tech support for this issue, they gave me the same troubleshooting steps as before and then when nothing worked, THEY JUST SAID THAT THEY WILL TAKE FEEDBACK. NO RESOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM!!!!!!!!! Even the supervisors are not able to help me out, so now I have got a fire stick which does not work with external audio sources and I am stuck to use it via the worse speakers of my TV.I am MORE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TECH SUPPORT I RECEIVED THAN THE DEVICE.

Life ain't complete without a Firestick !



  If you do not own this and own a TV you are missing something . Stop reading reviews and just order this. Life will be more peaceful. And do get that Netflix subscription. The lowest subscription works best.  Of course this means you will do less housework, spend less time in the gym, talk less to useless friends. But what a great device for you and your wife/husband to quietly spend the evening watching the movie ""Chances Are ....""

Works great but be mindful of which TVs it works with



  Great device, very performant. Doesn't lag on my Jio Wifi at 30 Mbps speed. Great picture quality. Only problem is that it didn't work fully with my Noble Skiodo TV - the volume and power buttons didn't integrate with the TV's software. Amazon should let customers know beforehand which TVs it works with. I saw Noble Skiodo in the list of TVs while setting up this remote but somehow it was not able to download the TV control software from their website. Noble Skiodo TV model that I had is no longer available on Amazon so that may be responsible for lack of software. Anyways, I returned it to buy a Fire TV stick Lite edition which doesn't have power and volume controls and will save me 400 Rs. I purchased this device for Rs 2199 in October 2021.

Very useful if you don't have a smart TV but have a TV with a HDMI port and internet connection.



  The product is very useful and worth the money. I bought it at 2200 at sale, but if you don't have a smart TV and have a TV with HDMI port and have internet connection, and also not thinking of upgrading the TV for like quite a time, then this product is very useful. But remember only the youtube content is totally free, everything else is paid, you need to have some OTT membership, which has really became normal these days. Also remember to buy an extender if your TV is wall mounted and the device may get trapped inside as the internet won't catch and it won't work. The extender included is really just a small cable, size of charging cable you get with a power bank.

It's pretty good



  It's fabulous and a good device/setup to convert  normal tv to smart version.. just read few comments regarding on/off and volume not working. Just telling u need to pair your tv with the firestick remote.. if it doesn't work.. you need to change the IR profile that's available for ur tv... Mine didn't work for the default one..I had to change the IR profile.. in have only TV option.. Hope this helps and clears ur doubt.. only thing that concerned me was space given.. only 4-5 GB space was provided.. which they should improve in the upcoming version..All in all, I liked it.. it's good way to convert ur tv into something more and more useful.. Watching 855 channels for free,latest webseries and movies for free,that too on the big screen... is something awesome.. So go for it.. U will love it..

It's Best out of All in that price range. But only one concern about 3rd Gen Fire Stick



  The product is a real gem. I have bought this 2nd time. First was 2nd generation one. I should have given 5 star for the product compare to price. I got it for Rs. 2099.00 on prime day sale. This was an irresistible deal. But I have given 2 star for the product to get attention the bug I am going to talk about. On my 2nd Gen Fire Stick when I connect to my Bluetooth Jbl Sound Bar it can play Dolby Digital Plus. I get the option to choose to play Dolby Digital Plus or only stereo. But on my 3rd Gen fire stick when I connect my Jbl sound bar via bluetooth it only shows stereo. I can't play Dolby Digial Plus via bluetooth. I have tried every possible way to play. But it can't. I hope it will be fixed very soon.

TV apps not available in app store



  VI TV & Movies, JIO TV apps are not available in app store.  You have to download it externally using google search (as suggested by customer care officer @ your own risk) but again once you download, it couldn't play like how other apps (Prime video) plays.  If these apps can be available here then there is no need to have separate d2h or cable connection for watching TV. Otherwise overall it's the best.

We're anyhow using a 200mbps unlimited broadband and this thing utilises full potential of internet. We don't feel like our money is getting wasted for internet connection or DTH. The fact that it requires only a fraction of electricity what DTH set top box uses is a cherry on the cake :)I would recommend this to anyone who uses a TV with no smart features. You won't regret...

Better than other android sticks .



  I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. I got this at price range of 2400 at Croma and offer salePros: those who are looking for lag free experience then go for this .Alexa is working fine .Stream quality is good.Cable length is large easily more than 1 meter length and also batteries have been provided in the box itself for the remote.Cons: since the quality of the remote seems to be delicate should need to handle with care.Some apps while multi tasking one over other seems to be little bit of lag(better than other sticks if u compare).Finally if u guys buy with extended warranty buy in online or if not buy in offline stores .

  Really nice hats of to Amazon for giving this product.........I was using Chrome cast for over 4 yes and when it came to end I thought to buy a latest one but when I searched on Amazon I founded fire stick it works perfectly well with Dolby digital audio and I don't even need my phone for watching prime or Netflix etc..... It thought to buy chromecast because of the reviews of fire stick but I thought to try it out and it's working.......the problem is The price is a bit high it should be around 3500 or less because fire stick lite base the same specs as 3rd generation has..........the main difference is it supports Dolby audio and has a volume feature in remote that's all

I usually watch cricket, tennis on some youtube channels which don't have rights to play livestream for India servers.So it's totally worth a buy for me.

Good Buy but bit costly



  During first time installation my Wifi did not connect. I am not sure whether it is because of HDMI adapter not used since in manual mentioned to use HDMI adapter for better network connectivity. Later I connected with HDMI adapter but still Wifi did not connect. Later I tried with my Mobile hotspot then it connected and updated the software. After that I tried to connect with my Wifi then it got connected. So I won't say this as a complaint but sharing my experience. So when you are trying to install it for first time better have a alternate network connection available.Pros:1. Volume and power button helps really well2. Very fast while using apps3. Even you can play gamesCons:1. I feel bit costly (only for added button features)

Honest Review of Firestick



  I was initially skeptical to buy this product because I wondered how my 10 years old LCD TV can connect to Internet on my home network and run the apps.  when I got the product all I had to do is insert the cell connect the USB port for the charging and hooked up the fire stick to my TV and turned it on, within no second it detected my Wi-Fi network and my old TV was able to connect to Internet, I downloaded Netflix prime and YouTube and voot, it all worked fantastic, the speed was much faster than it would play on my laptop, then I lost my remote, but guess what I could download the remote on my Android phone and use my cell phone as remote.  the voice commands are clearly catched and it plays exactly what you asked for.  now kids don't watch cell phone and watch TV which is at least good.  if you have a TV with HDMI port then this product is a must buy

Still lags



  1: I had a previous generation stick and I upgraded to this one for the new UI and supposedly faster response time. I was sadly mistaken. The UI lags if not for the worst from previous generation and I don't see any difference in opening of apps as well2: The battery cover is flimsy and keep coming off.3: In general I didn't like the new UI over the old one. It can be subjective.

Awesome little device



  Amazing device, whether you have a smart tv or not (HDMI input & good Internet connection required). I have an LG smart tv which doesn't support some apps, so went for Airtel Xstream box which gets stuck once in a day or two days. It was quite irritating. Bought this on Amazon prime day and got it for just 2k .. seamless connectivity and great streaming with loads of features and as a plus you get some OTT's free. Overall great product to have. Bought another one during Independence day sale but had to pay 2.7k for 2nd tv. Of course you need to have a good internet connection with 100 Mbps speed or as suggested to best performance. One thing I don't like is the voice recognition, sometimes it doesn't show what you are looking for.

Good to buy for Ordinary TV but with lite model



  Product is good and worth to buy for Ordinary or non-Smart TV. But the remote lags the feature of power off and volume adjust if the TV doesn't support it. So basic remote or lite model should be better for basic led tv as you should continue using TV remote for volume and power off. Otherwise streaming quality is good as long as you have better internet connection with minimum around 7mbps speed. Price is bit high normally but I bought during the offer so I am happy with it.

All movies are immediately released on OTT and hence, Theaters are now a Vintage. Go get a fire stick for you and enjoy.

Really good



  This is a great little device, speedy than previous one and streaming is top notch. Best to get during sale days as it‚Äôs quite expensive otherwise.I have the 2nd gen as well but it is slower and has issues in remote however this one is surely an improvement obviously.The delivery was on time and well packaged, still a better choice than the default sluggish interface of android in the so called newer smart tvs.Amazon seems to have an issue with Disney Hotstar as it‚Äôs recommendations are not shown on home page and that is a bad thing since I have a premium membership of that streaming service.Overall a very good product that serves its purpose.

Worst product



  This Amazon fire TV is pathetic product I receivedWhen I received order 1, the volume + was not working. Agent said to pay for remote 1999. Told him it's a brand new product which is defective. Then he placed a replacement. Received the replacement order and that stick is not getting detected in any TV.  Asked to another replacement the customer service agent said can't replace and now can only return n reorder.The cost of new is quite higher that the one I bought forAmazon seems not doing proper quality check on their products now a days....

Amazing



  I have an LG smart tv (bought in 2012 i guess) which doesnt connect to a wireless network and so i was sceptical about the purchase. I was however supposed to give it to a relative if it wouldnt work. But i was thrilled to see that it worked wonderfully. Setting it up was easy. My family enjoys the  streaming quality.

Not rightly priced, otherwise good



  I bought this because the latest Chromecast by Google is not available in India. The price to performance is not justified, this product should not cost more than 2.5k. The current price of 4k is completely unreasonable. Don't buy it unless there is an ongoing sale on it. And yes never get distracted by the discount percentages on Amazon for anything. Those percentages are manipulated by changing the MRP here and there. Now talking about the performance of the product, the U.I is better than previous generation of fire stick, the booting time is longer than the previous generation but once it's on it's indeed faster (I know this because I have the previous version as well which I have been using since 2 yrs). To sum up its the best amoung the limited choices that we have, but yes only if you get it under 3K.

Make in India and quality takes a hit :(



  I upgraded to this latest gen from the first gen Fire TV stick.My main reason for upgrading was the lack of TV controls and the interface bogged down a bit which made it a little irritating to use.Now coming to the product, I‚Äôm utterly disappointed with the build quality of the remote.  It feels like it would shatter after a few drops. The fit and finish is subpar and the rubber used on the buttons attracts a lot of dust. Once you hold this product in your hand, you‚Äôll immediately tell that it‚Äôs a very cheap product. The first gen felt a lot more premium.When it comes to the software aspect, it feels smooth and there are no lags. The new interface looks nice and the Alexa integration is nicely done.However, I do not like the frequent ads that are displayed in between episodes on Prime Video.Is it worth the MRP? Absolutely not.Is it worth buying during a sale after heavy discount? Yes, maybe.

Easiest way to upgrade to a smart TV



  Installation was super easy. However pls ensure that you have (a) good broad band connection, (b) your TV has a spare HDMI port and (c) you are subscribed with Prime, Netflix etc.I would say this is the easiest way to convert your TV to a smart TV. Recommended buy

An effective alternative for Smart TV



  Atfirst I should thank Amazon for giving a huge discount on this product during Great Indian Festival. Using it near about 3 weeks. Initially there was no lag in software and UI but after 2 or 3 updates UI has become slower. Software is hanging sometimes. Stream quality is very good. Wifi connectivity is awesome. But Bluetooth output through bluetooth enabled sound system  is awful . In those sound systems I am using Tantra bluetooth receiver ( version 5 ) . But speakers are not at all audible. But using the same sound systems with same bluetooth receiver with laptop and mobile is giving appreciable output. Device has also heating issue while using it with HDMI2AV converter. Voice response through Alexa is splendid. Mobile app for remote control also works most of the time without any issue. Particularly typing facility in the app is awesome. Overall a good and effective subsitiute for Smart TV.But still I would like to give some suggetions to the developers for the improvement of  couple of features in this device . Internal memory should be more. Heating issue should be corrected. Bluetooth performance should be improved.

I received 2 Fire TV sticks and both doesn't work!!!



  Guys at Amazon!! - This is seriously sad about the kind of product, that I have received. The first Fire TV Stick was not getting paired with the remote and the replacement was received today and it was the same issue. The Stick was responding to few commands to the remote through the app on the phone but going back to the screen which says ""Pair your remote"". The physical remote was not getting paired. Your tech guys took the remote access of my TV screen and tried their bit but still no luck. This is sad that you guys don't have any QC done even for a replacement product. The whole business of me wanting to change from Chromecast to Fire TV has become a futile one. The purpose of getting an Echo along with this is also become redundant. So I don't know what do do the Echo too. Now there is no more replacement according to you guys and it will be a refund. And again being a more than a regular user and purchaser of products through Amazon this is very depressing. Hope you guys can do something about it to me because the point of getting a product is have it put to use. Refund's doesn't work.

The customer service representative told me to replace it. They sent a new piece but I am facing the same problem with it. Now they are citing TV compatibility issues! How is it possible that I have been using my old firestick since months on my TV which is just one year old AND purchased from Amazon!! This problem of mine is still open. Hoping Amazon looks into it or else I am giving up Firetv forever! Too many hassles. No solution.

I loved it as I always wanted to experience Fire Stick OS



  *MUST READ*The product and the packaging was extremely good. I first thought that it might have been damaged because the packages brought by the delivery man were on top of each other. The fire stick OS is absolutely phenomenal. The best thing is that we don't have to pay any NCF fees or that just to stream on free applications. It is all good but sometimes it lags maybe due to my internet connection. In the third day of this I faced problems with my remote,I thought that it might be a problem of my TV but it wasn't, all other remote buttons were working just fine. I started panicking as it was my first time having a streaming device. The next day, I changed the batteries of the remote and it started working flawlessly. I am satisfied as I now cannot return my product as it will cost me almost double the cost I paid for it. Hopefully it works beautifully and without any lag in the future.

Best Smart Device



  I am writing the review after 1 full week of use. Below is the detail review :-Device Price/cost ::-I purchased Amazin fire tv stick plus which cost me around 3099/- rs with Sony liv + Zee5 + Voot annual subscription.U can lso purchase non subscription product but the difference is just 300 Rs and in which u get 1700/- rs of benifits.Please note without apps subscription the device is just playing You tube only. So. I recommended atleast get Prime and hotstar subscriptionStreaming quality ::-great streaming quality, convert your normal TV device in smart device, Internet connection required nand believe me just 5-10 mbps plan is enough to stream on full HD.Subscription activation ::-Believe me Sony Liv and voot can be subscribed without any problem. U jtt need to install the app and its showing u that u get the 1year membership and showing u a url, run it on yiur mobile device and enter the code which showing on Fire tv stick screen your subscription is started, u can also use it on your other mobile and PC Device as well.ZEE 5 Subscription ::-This is the most searched topic for this product, i also require Amazin customer care help to start this but by watching few You tube video i get how to start ZEE5.Its just simple you just need to clear cache and clear data of the app then uninstall the app and install it.And it shows 2 option u just chose 2nd one which was login with Amazon account and enter the OTP come on your Amazon account email and jayt after entering OTP,  It  will shows you the annual subscription.Please note if still it not helped again reinstall it 2nd time it will surely started.

Big issue. Very difficult to watch live channels



  To watch live channels we hav to always open related app. For example if you want to watch sab tv you hav to open sony live app. Live channels list is not showing in interface. We can not even see program timings. In home page interface  not a single live channel is showing. This problem is having only in fire stick 2021. So  it is nightmare to reach at live channels. Not showing ON NOW  option on home page. Not showing channel guide. If you command alexa to open aaj tak or any other live channel it will not show the specific live channel. This is software issue. Could be resolved in future. Till now not enjoying all the benefits of fire stick 2021. Very disappointed. Thinking to replace it with old fire stick having all the features.

Almost perfect



  So much faster than my previous Gen 1 Fire Stick. The new UI is meh (banner full of ads is not what I want to see when I start it up), but the performance has been faultless so far. Boots up quickly too. And no issues with Bluetooth peripherals like the previous one. Only deducting one star because of the abysmal build quality of the remote. The joystick and the battery cover creak every time I hold it. Feels extremely fragile. Added buttons on the remote are a timesaver. But please do something about it‚Äôs build in the next iteration.

  Good purchase I would say. The initial setup took sometime (probably due to my slow net connection). Amazon prime comes pre-installed. You might need to manually download other streaming platforms. The Remote is cool and handy. Works well with all navigation. The volume button only works for the TV. It doesn't have a volume function built in inside the Stick I think. Picture quality is good.  Regarding Audio, I connect the Fire Stick directly to my Harman AVR HDMI port which has only upto Dolby TruHd capability not Atmos. The display will always shows Dolby Digital Plus. And on new Amazon titles I get a clearer 3.2.1 surround sound @48Khz and 2.0.0 on old titles where the display still shows Dolby Digital Plus!Overall, it's a good buy. If you have a Dolby Atmos capable receiver and setup, then just go blindly and enjoy!

Good overall experience



  Navigation on Voice/Alexa is a little exerciseOne drawback which Amazon needs to fix on Alexa or Fire TV Stick is connectivity on 2.4 GHz router which takes at least 10 - 15 minutes to connect where in connects instantly on 5 GHz. Just for this bug users should switch to a new router... does not make sense

Remote just stopped working...



  I have been using the product for the last 3/4 months, but the Remote suddenly stopped working from yesterday. I tried all the methods given in the Amazon product care, like changing the batteries, relinking the remote, unplugging the firestick and plugging it again, etc. etc., but the remote just doesn't work. Would be great if someone could tell the solution, or replace the product....

Poor Support



  I could not pair the remote with the fire stick. Followed all the instructions.  Sad part is Amazon doesn't let you contact them. You go to customer service then choose products and either replace it or get a refund if eligible. There is no basic support where you can ask someone few questions. Sone simple details can avoid a lot of unnecessary returns and refunds.

Superb streaming device



  Mine is smart tv already but no support to hotstar and zee5 OTTs. That's the main reason I bought this device. Using this for the past two weeks and most of the times I don't see any lag. Sometimes I feel delayed response time Of fire stick.What I like:1. I bought it for 2099 during Amazon sale. For this price, this device is worth for each rupee we spent (I was thinking to buy mi box 4k considering the price earlier)2. Navigation and set up is smooth3. Streaming quality is really awesome4. Controls to operate TV. I feel this is very important as my original tv remote id already broken5. Alexa voice search: I like this a lot6. Preset button: though I'm not using much, this is very useful featureWhat can be added:1. App Store not offering all the apps that are available in play store of other android streaming device. If all the apps available, some education related apps like seesaw for ex. can be used on tv. This device deserves 5 star but due to this point and next, only 4 star at the moment2. If possible, offering play store also would be great something similar to galaxy store and play store on Samsung smart phones3. Alexa voice search is useful to open apps and play movie or songs on same OTT. If we want to switch to other app and sub task inside, Alexa could not get it. For ex, if I want to open and play a song in youtube from other apps, it just opens youtube but not completing the rest of the commands. Google assistant is better in this aspect4. Experiance of screen mirroring is pathetic. But I don't use this as almost all the apps that I use are available in fire stick. I tried just to check the feature

Remote not pairing up with device. It‚Äôs 3rd gen fire tv stick, aug 2021 manufactured.



  Seems there is a problem with newer fire tv stick device and Amazon engineering team already working on this as per the information from fire tv stick forums. Contacted customer service, they helped me to troubleshoot the Issue. I was asked to purchase a new remote and with that my fire tv stick is working well. Once I returned defective remote, money was refunded.

  There are two devices 1.Amazon Fire Stick and 2.Mi . Personally I love Mi devices. But after thorough analysis, I find this Amazon Fire Stick HD version to be little bit on higher class quality.Streaming speed is great. Alexa is doing good. Space saving. Lot of daily use streaming apps are there. Games are there.But one thing is the remote should be more hard. I have bought the device through Times prime subscription at a relatively cheaper price. Expecting to use it for a long time.

  This 3rd generation, is not value for money, or worth buying, as most of new features/ options in 3rd Generation Firestick, do not work properly, LiveTv or livetv function do not work with most of the  application. Hence dedicated functionality of live tv button is waste to add on remote. 8gb ROM is not worth price tag ‚Çπ3999/-.  Even FireStick is slow, hang issue, needs improvement in RAM management. Randomly, I faced Screen-freezing issue on internet/ wifi settings when reached to check connectivity issues ( wifi was connected, still not able to utilise/ access), and a lot more issue, I wrote multiple mail to them, but primeVideo/ amazon not able to resolve this til the date.

  The streaming stick is fast and responsive. Setup is easy and straightforward. I could not connect the stick directly to the HDMI port as  the ports are very close on my TV and I had other ports occupied too. So I used the provided HDMI extender to connect the stick to the TV. Connecting this way also helps to provide better WiFi connectivity as there is lesser interference from the proximity to the TV.

The ui is based on android but there is  No play store so u can't download many  apps dricectly For given app store (you  can download some of the apps with  another ways3.

  Nice way to convert non smart TV to Smart one. But underperforms in several areas1. User interface is not user friendly, specially the elderly ones faces hard time to manage2. Remote volume and power buttons not pairing with several tv models. Magic eye configuration would have been a better option.3. Alexa voice control is really poor4. Appstore is really missing several good TV apps like ditto TV, Jio Tv etc forcing users to use hacks or buy additional subscriptions integrated TV apps are really poor and provide only FTA channels even after subscriptions. Forcing to rely on individual channel apps like zee 5, Sony LIV, Voot etc with seprate subscriptions  for live TV streaming

An amazing streaming device!



  I would recommend to buy this only if you have a 1080P resolution Tv because when I plugged it into my 4k TV the resolution was too sharp and didn't seem good at all maybe because it was trying to upscale the resolution to match the TV's resolution. But after plugging into a 1080p screen the resolution was really good. The interface is snappy and personally I had no issues with it.

Great product and makes tv a smart tv with minimal cost.



  Would recommend anyone buying a 32inch or smaller tv to get a non-smart tv from a good brand like Sony / Samsung / LG and then just buy a Fire tv Stick 3rd gen to make it a smart tv.Since 32inch smart-tv's are usually not that smart enough and have limited applications with no voice control. Fire tv stick solves the problem very economically. Would definitely recommend this product.Note: there have been issues lately with Sony Liv app (not working) on fire tv stick (is the reason that I rated it 4 stars overall)

No inbuilt Screen-share/ Chrome Cast / Airplay, Low In built memory



  It‚Äôs not worth the price for two reasons.1. No adequate inbuilt wireless screen share options. The one that is there is not working. Third party softwares are a pain and quality is cheap. I wish I had ordered a different stream stick that offers built in screenshare options, they come cheaper too.2. Inbuilt memory is very less. Device got full with basic streaming apps and one game.they could have done a better job with the fire stick, by giving a good inbuilt screen share and a better memory and ram.Also, in between app navigation to find certain latest episodes is troublesome even with Alexa.It doesn‚Äôt really feel that I have ordered the latest version of fire stick.A lot of innovation still beckons to make it user friendly.

Best streaming device! Period!



  I love this so much I said bye to my set top box and hooked up these to both my TVs. Replacing my first gen device with this new unit in the sale. But what is weird is in July, the 3rd gen unit was priced at Rs 2400 (MRP Rs 3999)....and today when I purchased it again it says Rs 2799 (MRP 4999). Was it just to give the illusion of higher discount?Lovely device though! Love it!

Very good streaming device with commendable integration to Alexa



  ProsThe overall experience with the product has been good with me.1. The remote works really well.2. Alexa integration is good.3. Streaming quality works well.Cons1. Need to connect adapter and TV to different ports and the stick has limitations when connected to usb port on the TV.2. The appstore is very vast but miss on certain most popular apps unlike the Android TV.

Good enough



  Close to excellent for the core features of the device. Few cons.... (I) Power button can switch off the TV but it doesn't put fire tv on sleep (II) When fire tv is put to sleep, it doesn't put the display on sleep (III) There could be a way to turn off the recommendations, at least for the apps which are not installed.

Great product



  I'm using this product since 1month and I'm happy I bought it, especially fire stick. Fire stick can upgrade old led TV to latest one most of things.I highly recommend someone who does not want to change his 3-4 year old TV but as we all know our market is changing rapidly and if someone not want to spend 30k then just go for it.

  Everything is good user interface is good, voice recognition is also good  there is hardly any buffering while watching any YouTube video or any series on Netflix. You can also play games which are supported . The only thing I did not like was the the storage boundation . The storage is very limited around 6gb you can hardly install 10 to 12 apps.

Changes TV experience



  This is my 2nd Fire TV stick. I was totally satisfied with the first one, so I bought the 2nd one for my other TV. It is cheaper even with all the major OTT subscriptions than a regular DTH. Needless to say, the output quality is superb, and I get to watch whatever I want and whenever I want.The only issue I am facing with the 2nd one is that Alexa is fetching incorrect results quite a few times, something that I am not facing with the first one.

A good investment



  I'm not much, into series and OTT. But this device was really worth the money. I have a Samsung HD tv. Please make sure your TV has a HDMI port. The stream quality is good and the remote control is also comfortable to use. No problems so far with software and hardware. The sound quality of the streams are also good. Overall, I'd prefer buying a Firestick than a new Android TV/Smart TV. It was a good investment.

Great way to turn your normal TV into a smart one



  Very convenient to use plus you can download and use so many apps. You can also do basic internet search. The Fire TV stick essentially meets all my requirements.Sometimes the controls hang. I don't know if it's an app problem or TV stick problem but it's kind of frustrating when it hangs.

  Product is horribly placed on Amazon, I bought 1 on a special deal, and the battery were burning up on the first day and remote stopoed working. After returning and getting a refund, I tried buying it again amazon does not let me purchase it. I can't purchase it at the same amount, or even without the discount. As it says I've crossed my limit of pieces I can buy. Makes no sense, as I have none. It also means, according to Amazon, I can't own 2 tvs for 2 fire sticks

  Hi there, its been 7-8 days since my using of the fire tv stick 3rd gen.You have to buy this because it does not cost any subscription to use this and saves rs. 400 per month if the cable it only needs wifi to stream1. It provides you free movies, tv shows,  plus YouTube and some games that too smooth and etc .Too good just go for it it converts ur tv to a smart tv ......

  A must have product for a dumb tv to be a smart tv well some of the android tv lags because of the function they are meant to do but fire stick doesn't as it is meant to just be used as a media streaming device and the stream quality is also top notch not 4k but 1080p is enough for most of the people and it also supports Dolby Atmos The remote Quality is also good its a Bluetooth remote so it has good connectivity and it has alexa button so voice recognition also works like a charm

  what a product from Amazon, awesome.  Works very well in mobile Hot Spot.  It take very less data, i think while HD streaming it takes one GB in one hour.  This is proactive.  Far Better than a smart TV. Almost all smart TV has Bluetooth Sound bar issue like sound lag/delay etc.  But this fire stick has an instant connection with Sound Bar with Bluetooth connection.  Remote and Alexa is very helpful and easy to use.

Voice command is decent although regional shows can be accessed with voice command as alexa recognizes only English.
