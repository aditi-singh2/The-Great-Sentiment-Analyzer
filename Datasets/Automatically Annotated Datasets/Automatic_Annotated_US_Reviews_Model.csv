Great Product.  Great Price.  Running in All Weather!


I have been using these wireless headphones since October 2017 while running in all sorts of weather and am very pleased with the quality and sound for the price.  First, some background on me.  I will run (or as I age, I call it the “old man shuffle”) at a local university on both paved roads and trails so the run is both smooth and rough at the same time.  I will run for up to an hour or 5 miles “ish” and have run in heat of 90 plus degrees (lots of sweat), below freezing (lots of shivering), winds, thunderstorms, and all sorts of weather.  The headphones stayed in place and worked without issue in all of these circumstances.  I have even run with a “loose” fitting hat over my ears to keep my ears warm while wearing the headphones without issue.The amount of items you get for the price was a nice surprise.  It came with a very nice compact case, charging cable, car charger, and many extra earbuds.  I have actually tried the neoprene and foam earbuds in different weather and find that I like the neoprene in the heat and foam in the cold.Sound quality was surprisingly very good and these earbuds can get very loud.  Paring with my IPhone was simple as well as learning how to use the headphones.  I have never had an issue with the charge running out.  I have run for 5 of 7 days without the need to re-charge the headphones so I typically charge them on the weekends.I will admit that putting them on took a few tries.  First, it is highly recommended that you put them in the correct ears (I first tried them backwards and it took me looking in the mirror to realize I was doing it wrong – uncomfortable too!).  Make sure the black plastic cord that connects them is over your back.  The first time I ran, I had the cord in the front and it kept bouncing up into my face.  (I guess common sense helps!)  Now, I have learned that I insert into my ears first and then rotate the headphones to slide over and lock onto my ears.  Once on, I have never had an issue with them slipping off.My only complaint, although minor, is that the connector to charge the earphones is very small.  There is a “tiny” cover that has to be opened to insert the charging cable.  Again, as I have aged, I have to find my “reading” glasses to get the cover open and charger connected, as I can’t see small items anymore!  Not a big issue unless I can’t find one of my many pairs of reading glasses that always seem to be missing.Overall, in my opinion, these are a great pair of headphones and it comes with many extras.  I was so pleased with these that I bought a second pair for my son who is using them for running as well.  I would definitely purchase again.  Great Quality at a Great Price!Reviewed by G. Swanson

Awesome Buy!


For $40 I think they are pretty high quality. My husband has the Beats version and he said they look pretty much identical. The sound quality is pretty good. I like that I can talk on the phone using them. I have small ears so it was a concern for me that they would fall off. I went to the gym and tested them out and they worked out great. I have wore them around the house for 3 hours at a time and they didn't cause any pain or soreness. Score! I purchased the extended warranty to go along with them too. My husband is considering buying a pair too. Awesome buy!

Excellent customer service.


I bought these for my wife's birthday. She was very pleased with the ease of use and the ability to connect with two devices at same time. She consistently got 8 to 9 hours of use per charge and full charge took less than 2 hours.Unfortunately, after 5 months of steady use the headphones lost the ability to charge. We contacted Senso customer service and were pleasantly surprised by the truly 5 star customer service. The support team responded within an hour. They were courteous, professional, and provided troubleshooting steps in a clear manner that was easy to follow. When it was apparent that recalibration would not solve the issue they arranged for replacement headphones to be shipped. The whole process, from our initial contact to receiving order information on replacement headphones, was completed in less than 5 hours and this was on a Sunday! We received the new headphones 4 days later.We have recommended the headphones to other family members who have not had any issues and even with the charging issue we still feel comfortable recommending them to others, especially since we know the quality of care the company puts behind their product.

Finally, wireless earbuds that work!


I like to listen to audiobooks while I’m doing yard work, doing housework, or cooking.  As wireless “ears” became available, I was so excited that I would no longer have to have my iPhone tethered to the phone jack. Well, easier said than done! I have small ears on a small head so the buds would fall out when I bent over with the “necklace”style, the ones with “ear prongs” either didn’t fit or hurt my ears, I have no interest in full headphones as they are bulky & the headbands tend to flop forward or backwards as I move around.  These SENSO earbuds are perfect!  The earbuds stay in place, the sound quality is excellent, the instructions are clear, concise, and complete, & the connecting cord is flat and sturdy.  They charge quickly and they really DO have 8 hours of juice. I also didn’t have to mortgage the dog to afford them, which is another plus.  Great job, SENSO!

Great quality wireless earphones


I am in love with these wireless earphones. They were very easy to pair to my iphone 7 plus by using the guide. I love the quality of them ( they're comfortable) the sound( clear and you can hear the bass baby!) , and the features that they have.  I like how when I put them in my ear and press the button they tell you that they are on or off. I also like that when I have a phone call, they call out the phone number that is calling ( without me having to go look at my phone).  I like how they don't take a long time to charge and last a long time. I also like how it turns blue when it is fully charged.  I love how they included 2 usb cables (1 long 1 short) and a car charger and extra ear buds. I highly recommend these. This is a great value for the price.The seller offered great customer service. I liked how they checked on me to see if I am satisfied with my purchase. They also reassured me that If I have any issues with the wireless earphones in the future, that they are covered under a 1 year warranty.  I highly recommend this seller. These earphones are well worth it.

I love these headphones


Updated Review:I liked these so much, I bought 3 more pair for Christmas gifts.  Everyone that received them liked them.  Honestly, for the money, you can't beat them.  As far as the negative reviews that you see, they are all nit picking.  If the headphones don't sound good, change the ear bud tips.  As all ear buds, they have to fit.  These came with plenty of different sizes to choose from.Original review:I have been using these for 2 days.  My first impressions are that they are an OUTSTANDING value for the money.  They came with 4 sets of different sized ear-bud tips.  Plus a 2 port car charger and a cable that is compatible with both Iphone and Android.They sound just fine and are extremely comfortable.  The hook around the ear is made of a silicone type substance which is very flexible.  This makes them extremely easy to put on and off as well as very comfortable.I highly recommend them.

Great buds with a great price


These earbuds were purchased to replace Apple Air pods. I looked over many brands including the Bose QC 30 and Powerbeats 3 before settling on these. I could not believe that the price would be a good reflection of the quality of the sound and figured I would give them away if I was not happy with them. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume especially compared with the Air Pods. Finally I had to actually control the volume to decrease it. I initially had 2 problems with the Senso buds. The fit was not correct and for my usage was uncomfortable and the battery charge did not last and I had to charge them every day. Before I could change the cushions I got an email from the company and I explained the issues to them. The person responded and we had an email conversation to rectify both issues. The recommendation was to try the different sizes and even the foam cushions that come with them and that both ears might not be the same size. This worked and I am comfortable. The other issue required a reset and they gave me the instructions for that and the charge lasts for more than 24 hours when not in use.This was outstanding customer service considerably better than Apple or Bose.For the price these are great and I use them now on a daily basis.

Battery issues resolved through a reset


Great sound quality and I enjoyed them until a week ago when they stopped charging. It doesn't matter which charger I use, they charge all night and notify me of ""low battery"" as soon as I wear them. They lasted almost 3 months :/*** UPDATE: The customer service from Invotek is prompt and outstanding. They were willing to do a full refund if a reset didn't work, but gave me instructions on how to do it, and the issue has resolved. In case you have the same issue or any other malfunction, here's the snippet from the email with instructions on how to do resolve it:""Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.Also, the issue you have described is common all Bluetooth devices as the connection between the two devices gets ""corrupted"" and needs to be re-configured.  In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again.  In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices.  Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device.  Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.I am confident that this will fix your issue.Also, you are covered by our 1 Year Warranty, so you have nothing to worry about in case these don't work.""I have many pairs of Bluetooth headphones and these are my favourite due to comfort and sound quality. So happy they are working perfectly again!

Happily Surprised !


I actually love these Bluetooth headphones.  Ear pieces and over the ear loops fit perfectly.  For me, comfortable, and secure.  The sound quality is awesome.  I don't use them to run or exercise so I can't comment on how they preform under those conditions. Primary use is for my Samsung Tab 4 and my HTC cellphone.  Pair quickly and easily. On/Off button. Volume controls. Microphone.  Blue/Red led indicates current function. Charge quickly. Best of all, when turning ON/Off  you hear (while still wearing) an actual voice saying ""Turning Headphones On/Off.""  I have not used the microphone or  calculated the number of run-time hours  before recharge.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email from Senso reminding me of my warranty and their 24/7 help line for any issues with my headphones.  Thank You, Kenneth.UPDATE 10-20-2019  Two years and these little Bluetooth Headphones are going strong.  Still take a good charge and the sound is great.

The only one that boosts my Mac volume!


I often watch instructional videos on my Mac and the volume is too low, especially if there's other noise nearby. I looked into boosting the Mac volume artificially using apps, but learned that that can damage the Mac speakers. This is the only pair of headphones I've tried that is able to significantly boost the volume (via noise cancellation or directional targeting or whatever) so that I can actually hear all of the videos. The handy hard carrying case is also nice so the headphones don't turn on accidentally due to physical pressure applied by surrounding objects. And there's three different sizes for the ear buds so that it tends to stay in my small ears for the most part. The design is visionary and so even if the buds fall out of my ear the hooks make it so there don't fall away and are easy to put back in.

Wish I bought these before trying 3 other pairs.


I wish I had bought these before I went through 3 pair of cheaper headphones.  I've only worn twice so I will update this review if things change but my first impression is WOW.The headphones fit comfortably and the sound is great.  The cord doesn't cause any issues while running where others I've had create a bounce effect when running.  The headphones pair quickly EVERY time which seems like no big deal except none of my last 3 pair paired so easily, it was always a hassle.  They feel very light and you forget you are running with them.Minor cons (still 5 star product):Slight hiss sound after bluetooth connected with nothing playing.  Gone when you play music and not noticeable between songs (it might disappear altogether).The power/pause button is very easy to hit which is a good thing in one way but bad in another. If I move the headphone to adjust, I find myself pausing the music and since my music app is my background app when running, I have to open the app to restart the music.Positive surprisesThe amount of additional stuff shipped with the headphones make you sure you will be happy.  I know the description says it has extra buds, dual cable and car charger with 2 ports but when you open the box and have all this it's really nice.Absolutely worth every penny so far.  My last pairs failed after a few months of heavy use. Will update this review if that happens to these.  H

Amazing Product, Amazing Customer Support, Amazing Battery Life, Amazing Sound & Bass


These Bluetooth Headphones fit well, and feel great. They sound stage is very large and has deep bass, more that I had expected. The range is pretty good as well as the battery life is spot on, even at near full volume (not recommended to use full volume they get LOUD). I was weary of the wire getting in the way but since the controls are on the the ear buds the wire is never in the way and is super light so it feels non-existent. Also since the controls are on the ear bud, it is easy to locate them- on top of that the controls work really well; I might recommend flipping the volume up and volume down buttons but that is my only recommendation. For me the memory foam ear tips work the best, they seal extremely well, after contacting Invotek they were able to track down some replacements that I could buy for feature use, I highly recommend getting a pack: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ABWGHHG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1That brings me to my next topic, their customer service is on point, very quick to respond, very devoted to customer service and experience. I had the delight to work with Kimberly Pollak and I would like to give her a shout out. I have seen other reviews that say this product sometimes fails a few months into use, so don't forget to register the product for the amazing one year warranty that they provide; remember the device is not water proof so don't go swimming with it either.

A mixed bag of surprisingly good and surprisingly bad


I'm a little surprised that this product is currently the best selling Bluetooth earbud set on Amazon.  The price certainly isn't unreasonable, but it isn't the cheapest either, and the set has some very significant shortcomings.  The first thing you will notice is that they are very large for earbuds and protrude significantly from the ears.  Some may not have a problem with this, but I think they are an eyesore in use.  The foam tips fit nicely into my ear canal and they stay put nicely as well, but the over-the-ear anchor is made of relatively hard plastic and becomes uncomfortable quickly for me.  Wind noise is another odd and disappointing side effect of their size and shape.  Even walking with them on a windy day renders them almost useless, and forget about using them for active sports like bicycling.  Last but not least, they are the slowest to connect of any bluetooth buds I have ever used.  They take a full 20-30 seconds to get a stable connection to my modern Android phone and during that time the sound cuts in and out maddeningly.The large size is probably also responsible for the two most impressive selling points of this set:  sound quality and battery life.  I don't have extensive experience with a variety of Bluetooth buds at every price point, but these are the best sounding set I have used.  The sound rivals a decent set of wired earbuds, and this was very surprising to me.  Battery life is similarly impressive.  I get tired of listening to music or podcasts long before the battery runs out on this set, and I don't even need to charge them every day.

Don't buy them!


Here's the deal...these headphones don't sound horrible and the battery life is pretty good.  They just don't stay connected.  I'm a distance runner and I bought these to use on 3-4 hour runs and within 15-20 minutes the headphones disconnect from my device and I'm left listening to my feet for the rest of the time.  I've tried everything I can think of: I've charged them right before a run, I've tried putting the device on a different arm, I've tried running when it's dry, I've tried running in the rain, I even tried just setting it on the device and home and seeing what would happen and they still disconnect.Look, I'd love to give these things a good review because I really do like the battery life but at the end of the day no matter how good the things sound or how long they last if they don't connect and stay connected they're completely worthlessDon't buy them.  Spring for a more expensive name brand pair that'll keep working.

Sound constantly cuts out


I really wanted to love these headphones. They were so cheap, the sound quality was pretty good, and they were so convenient. However, I had too many issues and ultimately had to return them for several reasons.First of all, they were not really noise-cancelling. During my commute, I often could barely hear my music over the sounds of the subway, let alone block out those noises, even if my volume was turned was turned way up.Second and more importantly, the bluetooth connectivity on these headphones sucks. If I was just sitting in place, I had no issues. However, during my commute I'd constantly hear the music cutting out. This would only last about 1 second at a time, but it happened so frequently that eventually I couldn't ignore it. If I turned my head to look to the side, the connection would cut out. If I put my phone in my purse or back pocket, it would cut out. If it was raining outside, it was almost impossible to listen because it would cut out so often. I confirmed that it wasn't an issue with my phone or Spotify, and from reading several of the other reviews it sounds like I'm not the only one who experienced this.

THESE ARE NOT THE SAME, THEY'RE SO CHEAP, AND THE EARHOOKS ARE NO LONGER ADJUSTABLE - SENSO SAYS, ""THEY DON'T MAKE THE ADJUSTABLE EARHOOKS ANYMORE BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMERS PREFER THEM FLEXIBLE SO NOW THEY'RE JUST FLEXIBLE"". I ASKED IF THEY HAVE ANY HEADPHONE WITH FLEXIBLE EARHOOKS, THEY SAID NO.SO ALL OF THIS TO SAY, THE EAR HOOKS DON'T EVEN HOOK MY EAR, THEY'RE TOO BIG AND DO NOT CONFORM TO THE EAR.IF YOU ONCE LOVED SENSO AND EXPECT THE SAME QUALITY....STEER CLEAR!! I'M NOW ON THE HUNT FOR A PAIR OF HEADPHONES THAT JUST DON'T EXIST ANYMORE :(

Were great while they worked


Did not know what to expect from these but not that I got a chance to listen to them on my iphone and my pc I am impressed! they feel comfortable and overall sound is pretty good. I can say they are close to sounding like my apple headphones. They go loud as well, also love the fact that they came in a case, extra ear buds, a usb charger and an iphone lightening cable which I was not expecting. I will be using these in the gym so I will give this review an update after noticing how well battery life is, overall comfort and quality.--------------UPDATE-----------50 DAYS AFTER MY PURCHASE AND THESE THINGS DONT WORK ANYMORE. What a waste of money. I only used these on an average of 5 hours a week inside the gym. I have had a $20 pair of bluetooth headphones that lasted over a year without a problem. And now I cannot even return them.

I’d give the


I bought these headphones about a year ago.... so have had some time with them now and here is my thoughts:Pros:- packaging is nice- you get some nice kit along with the headphones (eg the car charger and cable are pretty nice, seems like good quality tho I haven’t really used them much and just charge at home)- they las a reasonably long time and charge in a reasonably short timeMeh’s- sound quality is so-so.  The base is overbearing, the treble is muted and sounds distant. Highs are definitely rolled off. Sounds stage is cheap sounding.(Am I an audiophile? Not really... I have a few high end cans and try to buy the best in my albeit limited budget so have some experience with both good and crummy headphones)Bad:- the ear clips (whatever it’s called that goes around your ears) are garbage.  They have the support of a wet noodle. Headphones consistently work their way out of my canals and have to repeatedly be pushed back in, both during workouts and at rest.Final verdict:Meh.  They’re what you get for cheap.  I have a few pairs of this style, mainly because I wasn’t satisfied with these and wanted something that wouldn’t fall out of my ears all the time.... however the sound of these is slightly better than those.I would not recommend these. I would not buy them again if the ones I have conk out. (I’m always on the cusp of giving them away but then I have to spend more cash to replace them and they’re not terrible).They work, but just so.Hope that helps (in the scheme of 30K+ reviews, statistically 60% of which are fake... seriously. Look it up!!... happens almost across the board).Cheers.

Totally not waterproof


I used to love these Bluetooth headphones. And then I decided to use the waterproof feature and go swimming for the first time today. The instant I got them wet they were dead even though everything is closed everything looked great and these are supposed to be waterproof. They have work great for all exercise up until the pool......... UPDATE TO REVIEW> Customer service is great, I contacted them to discuss and they replaced my headphones, however they informed me that (As we informed you earlier, the Senso ActivBuds S-250 are IPX7 Waterproof rated and have been tested by submerging them fully into water for a short period of time.  Although, most IPX7 rated devices can be submerged under water for short period of time, it is still recommended not to do so.  That being said, the Senso ActivBuds will hold up very well against rain, heavy sweat, and all kinds of other activities which involve interaction with moisture.) When I looked up what IPX7 means, it states IPX7: Can be submerged up to 1 meter in water for 30 minutes. I killed 2 pairs of these by swimming less than 30 minutes, and I was for sure less than 1 meter down.

I'm done. I used to love these.


I bought a replacement pair recently after I broke my old pair, and as soon as I took them out of the box I could tell there was a difference. The new pair just felt....cheaper. The plastic felt cheaper, the buttons made a clicking sound when you touched them since they were so loose, but the worst part was the ear hooks. I usually have problems with keeping earbuds in due to my inner ear canal shape, but the thing that I loved (loved as in past tense) about these earbuds was the ear hooks. I could do practically anything wearing them and they'd comfortably stay in.With the replacement pair, however, the hooks were just rubber pieces that couldn't be shaped. The hooks on the old pair had a piece of wire inside of them that allowed you to bend and shape them, thus the universal fit. But as soon as I put on the new pair I could almost instantly feel them sliding out of my ears, and of course the hooks did absolutely nothing because you couldn't bend and shape them! What's even the point! Seriously, they're just pieces of rubber that do absolutely nothing unless you just so happen to have extra large ears.To be fair, they still sound pretty much as good as they did before, but what's the point if they won't stay in? I even tried using the larger foam tips they came with, but they always would just fall out. I'm not even running or anything like that, I'm just walking and these things won't even stay in. It's extremely frustrating to have to push them back in every 15 seconds.I blame it all on cheaper manufacturing. Like I said before, the difference was instantly noticeable. It's such a shame that Senso has gone down the path of so many other corporate institutions that think they can cheapen their products and people will just be ok with it. I threw these things in the garbage rather than try to have Senso replace them with another pair that more than likely will still be just as cheap. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but I highly doubt it. More than likely this is just greedy capitalism at play: cut costs and make more money. Except in this case, where I'm gonna buy my replacement pair from somewhere else.

Maybe just a defective set...


I'm no audiophile but I'm honestly not sure how these have been rated so high unless the masses don't care about sound quality. I've used Sennheiser (corded) earbuds for quite a few years and also had a set of over the ear ones, and while I wasn't expecting much for the price, these had two issues. The majority of my use lately has been doing yard work, mowing the lawn, etc. but was getting tired of dealing with the cord. After ordering the Senso, I was pleased with the packaging, what they had to offer and got them paired to my phone quickly. Listening to Pandora which is how I use my Sennheisers, the sound was VERY bass heavy and couldn't turn the volume up much. The other problem I had using it for the first time, is that regardless if I had my Samsung S7 in my back pocket, or sitting on the trunk of my car within a 10-20ft line of sight, the sound cut out quite frequently sometimes for seconds at a time. I tried moving the wire around by the ear buds and could replicate the sound cutting out a few times but regardless, they had to go back. Unfortunately due to the sound quality alone I just couldn't see keeping these or using them enough.

Update: Got a second pair, and completely different.  ZERO bass, sound horrible.  I am so disappointed, I told family and friends about them.  Maybe they make money by sending out a good pair here and there and garbage otherwise.  I am returning them, so maybe I will upgrade if another pair work.  If not, heed this warning if you have bought them yet, NOT ALL PAIRS ARE EQUAL!!!I have only had them for a week, so can't speak to longevity, but the sound is really really impressive at this price.  I honestly can't believe they are selling at this price point, but I sure do appreciate it.I stumboled onto these on Prime Day (only save $7 off the $37 spot) and reviews were off the charts so I pulled the trigger (needed a decent pair).Most other pairs at this cost sound like garbage and last a couple months.  These sound insane, but we will see how long the last.Great clarity, strong base, well made, and very comfortable.  They feel and sound like a $150 headset easy.

Terrible as headphones, but my dog loves the case...


When these first arrived and I put them on I was disappointed that I was unable to find ANY way to wear them without causing pain inside my right ear. I couldn't understand but assumed that as the right side is the control side it must be slightly different. I understand that I'm incredibly sensitive, but unfortunately that means that a piece of hard plastic pushing into the cartilige inside of my ear ends up being incredibly painful. Still, I tried to ignore this.I was happy when I was able to quickly pair the earbuds with my Samsung Galaxy S7 (shows how cheap I am, but I'm happy for the upgrade from my S5.) I was also happy when I was able to actually answer a call. The sound coming through was unbearably loud, but that's no surprise for me, again Ms. overly sensitive. The frustrating thing was that although I was supposed to be able to adjust the sensitivity so that the next time I answer and make a call it would be quieter, I found that every single time I answered and made calls I had to adjust the volume down once the call was connected.  Not very fun since I pretty much have to have the earbuds in my ears to do this. If I don't, I end up disconnecting the call with the overly sensitive buttons. I was on my way to blowing out my eardrums.Along with my being overly sensitive I am unfortunately extremely quiet. Not so fun for anyone else whom I'm trying to talk to. No matter how high I turned up my phone AND the earbuds, and not to mention put all the energy I had into trying to use my diaphram to control my oxygen and voice level, the person on the other end was always telling me they couldn't hear me. What people WERE able to hear however were any sounds that were around me, such as birds chirping, a slight breeze blowing or water running.These Bluetooth headphones were supposed to allow me to use my phone since I'm unable to hold it up to my head for more than a minute or two due to chronic illness related disability. It's been so difficult searching for a replacement Bluetooth for my previous Plantronic that I got at Costco many years ago. I especially miss the ones which were able to properly do voice-to-text.People don't understand how hard it is for the disabled to be able to acquire products and technology necessary to assist them in their lives while meanwhile people who don't need such things are much more apt to come by these products and technologies. Sorry for the gripe, it was more a reflection that I used to have this on my $30 bluetooth for my Palm phone, but once that sort of thing became mainstream it's all of the sudden $300 and requires a $1,000 phone. Ridiculous what some people will pay money for instead of deciding that's ridiculous.Oh well. I almost forgot the about the case. This headset comes in a semi-hard rounded zippered case. And my dog thinks it's the perfect size to grab and try to get me to chase her around the house for. So at least she likes the case. :) That's all that really matters anyways.

Excessive wind noise


Unfortunately, these did not work for me, in spite of me hoping they would due to the low price point. First of all, I had no problem with the audio quality indoors. I did change the iPhone to low base for a more true sound, as they were pretty base heavy out of the box. But I downgraded the rating for these two reasons; 1) The over-ear loops were way too big for me, and not adjustable. They actually rode completely above my ears (I do have small ears). 2) The biggest complaint is the amount of wind noise they pick up. I ran on a completely calm morning, but just the air movement caused by me running was amplified in the headphones and quite annoying. I cannot imagine what these would be like on a bicycle where actual speed or wind was present. Granted, after a little while, you may get used to the wind noise and you can always just turn the volume up higher, but those did not seem like reasonable compromises to me. I returned the headphones and will seek a different option. Note, I am coming from a $140 pair of Jaybirds which I really liked, but they finally died and I was hoping to replace without spending a large sum of cash. I ordered a $50 pair of Phaiser BHS-750 and we'll see what they are like.

Not as good as their 2017 version


NOTE: I clicked on the old order and it linked me to this product. So I purchased presuming the products were the same.I bought these headphones in May 22 of this year. I chose to get these due to my VERY GOOD experience with these headphones back in 2017. These were purchased to replace the ones I had from 2017 since those were starting to wear out with exposed wire and etc. Where as the 2017 version would easily get 5 stars, this time these do not.Comparing the two, my main issue is that the ear hooks in the 2019 version that I received has a wire frame that you can use to adjust to your ear and etc. Like inside feels like you're bending a worn out paper clip that you've been bending back and forth or some wire frame. This sounds like a good idea, but it's one of those good thought but very bad execution. The problem is when you're moving or talking or doing anything, it moves the ear hooks and it cause the suction of the buds to come out. Making it feel like it's not fully in your ear or stays there uneven. For headphones that are designed for physical activity, it's perplexing why they would design the hooks to have that flimsy wire instead of plastic that's one size fit all like in the past.The price changed too, but I thought it was just due to the 2 year time between my last purchase and this current one.  At the time of purchase in 2017 it was about 10-12$ more to the current price (29.99 instead of 19.99 or so and factoring any tax and shipping).Overall the quality of this current product should be considered, and ultimately I do not recommend it. I hope they go back to how they manufactured these like in 2017. I'd pay more, for better quality.

Great headphones for a small price tag !!!


I LOVE these headphones !  I use them to watch TV late at night when the rest of the household is sleeping.  They pair quickly to ourConnect brand universal wireless audio transmitter. The battery life is AT LEAST 8 hours and they charge quickly !  The customer support for this product is excellent.  I haven't experienced any lag time what so ever with these and the quality of the sound is GREAT for such an inexpensive product. I agree with the other reviewers who've noted..... no need to JAM these into your ears. Just insert them, without screwing them into into your ears and they are so comfortable, you'll forget all about them.  They are perfect for us night owls who are sick of trying to watch TV on a low volume in order not to keep everyone else awake at night !

Noise blocking, not cancellation


As far as I know this product blocks the outside sound / noise, it does not actively cancel it like a Bose Noise Cancellation headphone or their like.This requires a very tight fit of the ear buds, otherwise noise will leak in. I had to experiment with the various sizes of ear buds to get a fit that blocked most of the sound.Perhaps interestingly; I am ~90% deaf with tinnitus. My expensive hearing aids can receive my iPhone's Bluetooth so that I can listen to music, but it sounds terrible, with a annoying tinny quality. However, phone calls' voices are excellent. The SENSO Bluetooth headphones music sounds great, but their iPhone call quality is worse than my hearing aids; too much bass and not enough treble (the exact opposite of the hearing aids).For a normal hearing person, I think you will find the cell phone quality very good.For their price, I doubt they have much competition! Highly recommended!

Stopped working in 3 months


I am writing this review because the majority of reviews are written within the first week and do not reflect the product's performance over a reasonable period of time. These headphones worked moderately well for the first few months (there were some connectivity issues at times, but I figured they were fine enough for the price). However, these are advertised as waterproof, and they certainly did not live up to that standard. In the shower a week after purchase, they immediately cut off. I assumed they were broken, but a day later they turned back on after drying out. This happened another time in the shower, prompting me to not wear them near water anymore. Then, just over 3 months into owning the headphones, they cut out randomly during one of my workouts. Again, a day later, they were restored (maybe they cut out due to the water from sweat?). And finally, last week, they cut out for good. Will not turn back on. I am just outside of the return window, so I have to eat this cost.I know there are a lot of positive reviews. But as consumers, we need to be aware of how companies are manipulating Amazon's review process. They are drowning out the real, authentic experiences, like the one I am documenting here. I recommend against buying these headphones, as you will most likely be replacing them in 3-6 months. Good luck!

Not bad


I have these for about two years now, and I must say that it's still holding up pretty well. These things are damn loud when you put them to the max so watch out for that. They are also pretty good at picking up muffled/lowered sounds when I use them to watch videos. They secure nicely to your ears, depending on what tip you put on (never changed mine and they fit well in other people's ears when they borrow them), and I have used them during exercise. The noise cancelling is passive, meaning that they act like ear plugs, and they do drown out background or environmental noises, not completely though but still pretty well that I find them good for calls. I love the added accessories too!My only gripe with the product is the Bluetooth connectivity. It used to be super easy and fast to connect to my Iphone 6+ when it was brand new, but then I have difficulty connecting it sometimes. It still works though, just annoying when it does not work on the get-go. Works well with a Samsung S8 too!Oh yeah, don't be stupid and assume that the battery life has a long duration like 8-240 hours. It might be like that when its new, but after a couple of months, you will see performance to drop as battery loses charge over time; it is also good to note that the duration of battery depends on usage.Overall, not bad!

Quality has drastically changed


I had first purchased these Senso ActiveBuds headphones back in 2019, and felt they were a great pair of headphones for the price. The sound was good, and you could actually adjust the earhooks to tighten around your ear, as they were pliable and kept the shape you adjusted them to.Unfortunately, I lost them this past week (May 2022), and figured I'd just order a new set. The quality of the headphones has decreased drastically, as now they have a cheap plasticky feel & are lighter in the hand.Additionally, the earhooks are no longer adjustable, as they just flop over your ear, as other recent reviews have also mentioned.  I'm disappointed I have to return them, but these are not the same pair of headphones, in terms of quality, from years past.

Stopped working after less than 6 months; unresponsive customer service


I purchased my second pair of these headphones in Feb 2018 (after my first pair accidentally got thrown out). I really liked the overall sound quality for the price, the battery life, and the fact that they were sweatproof and stayed in my ears for workouts.In July 2018 they suddenly stopped working in the middle of my workout and nothing has worked to revive them including resetting them. After trying all possible options I could think of, I reached out to Senso via their website, which at this point was several weeks ago. I never heard back from them on my inquiry or whether there was anything they could do for me. Based on the faulty product and complete lack of care by customer service, I cannot recommend these headphones to anyone else looking for affordable bluetooth headphones. I wish I was comfortable buying a 3rd pair, but I will take my money elsewhere with better customer service.

Buyer beware... potential fire hazard... very disappointed


I guess you get what you pay for... I got these a couple of weeks ago and was initially very pleased.. design was good, fit was snug, battery life okay and music quality was sufficient (any kind of bass was pretty muffled, even country).. I used these for 60-75 minute gym sessions, long cardio, weights, etc... a full charge would usually last four workouts... but today, middle of elliptical workout, they shut off.  iphone 7 was fine, headphones just shut off, couldn't reset them, power them back on, nothing... I had just charged them one day prior to assumed that wasn't the issue.  When I got home, I tried to charge them again just in case that had lost all charge... I come back in the room 15 mins later to a burning smell... I pick them up and they're nuclear hot... and then I see they've exploded.

Horrible went through 2 pairs in the span of a month or two.


I had reviewed these head phones probably after having them a few weeks but by the 3rd month i had to have them replaced becaus they wouldn't hold a charge.  The company was very responsive and good about replacing them.  However the second pair only lasted a month before it completely stopped working.  So I am retracting my previous review which is below:Headphones are pretty good.  Sound quality is great, they don't tangle and they fit comfortably. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I never know how much battery life I have left.  I wish when you either turned it off or on the voice would inform you. Otherwise I love them.

Cheap quality, bad sound and flimsy material


We ordered it after seeing so many reviews. First of all this should be used best as a toy. Cheap quality, sound is bad and plastic that goes over the ear is so flimsy that it does not stay on ear while running which is the only purpose you would buy this.Next part, their customer service is horrible. Product that I received was not sealed and when I opened it earbuds seems to be used. Secondly, they advertised lot of bonus accessories like mobile phone wallet and car vent holder that comes with it but I received none of those. When I reached out to their customer service, they asked me to just return the product to Amazon. Easy right. That’s what they business model is. I feel most of the reviews are fake as lot of these companies lure positive reviews by offering customers some freebies. Beware and buy it only if you are ok with using it as occasionally for emergency use only.

Cheap Piece of Junk, You Get What You Pay For:  Do Not Buy This Product!


Where's the zero stars.  This is a piece of junk.  It's uncomfortable on the ears and the controls don't respond well when you push the buttons, and the volume control doesn't adjust the volume on the iPhone.  I keep tapping away on the volume control and it advances to the next track or goes back to the previous one.  The controls are just plain lousy.  30 minutes into using this and I've already had enough and put it back in the box and am returning it for a refund.  Don't buy this product.  Spend the extra money for a superior product.

Not for me!


Product had issue with the noise cancelling or something. When riding my bike, the audio would constantly cut in and out. I think it had something to do with the microphone, or noise cancelling, as when I stopped or slowed down, the issue would resolve itself. Contacted customer support and they suggested I do a factory reset, but that also didn't work, as I could duplicate problem by simply blowing a hair dryer across the headphones. For me, the earbud for my left ear was uncomfortable  as it didn't fit MY ear. In the car, or in the house, they were fine, but that's not the reason I purchased them. I also wished the over the ear piece was a little more firm, as it would not stay over the top of my ear. These units just didn't work for me, but may work fine for you.

One of the better budget headphones around


This is one set of headphones you want if you're on a budget. The sound is ok. Not great but not bad either. If you're used to full sized headphones these will be a bit disappointing. I paired it with my iPhone and pairing is simple enough.There is, however, that subtle background hiss with these headphones that's hard to ignore once you know it's there. I don't see this a problem if you're out and about in the gym or in public. These are definitely not designed for critical listening. The bass is a bit boosted and the midrange is not as smooth as I want them to be.When tested with a range of tracks, featuring a few popular hip-hop albums, some jazz, rock, and even the occasional metal track, the high-definition nature of the sound of the ActiveBuds S-250, including their deep bass and crisp treble, became apparent from the first few seconds.Again the midrange is muddy sometimes.However, this is certainly one set of headphones you should consider if you know its limitations.The build quality is good. It comes with all the cables you need and it even comes with it own hard carrying case which is rare at this price point. It charges exactly how the manual says it would which is about 2 hours.I've never been a fan of in-ear headphones but these are very comfortable. It comes with three silicone ear plugs.The pricing, however, is a bit strange with the other two color combinations costing a few dollars more. But they're all still below $40.I only gave it 4 stars because of the background hiss.Recommendation: Why are you still reading this? Go get a pair 😊

Stopped working after 3 weeks


I run daily and rely on wireless head phones.  They were very comfortable, battery life was great and I really liked them.  One day while running they just stopped working.  I thought maybe the battery just died, but it was weird since usually a voice comes up telling you ahead of time that ""battery low.""  After that event I went to recharge them in the car and the light did not come on showing that it was charging.  I tried to charge at home on another adaptor but still no luck.  My biggest mistake was setting them aside and not returning them immediately.  Time passed and by the time I got around to sending them back, the time had passed so I was out a few bucks.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I did try ordering another pair from another company and they were basically the same product with a different logo on them.  I'd say keep away from any of the brands out there that look like this product because that 2nd pair I got did the same thing but only after 1 week.  I was quick to return those though, so I'll get my money back.

And these cost almost $40?


Look for the edit below.My response to 5-star bluetooth headphones working for 20 mins straight, should not be ""Wow, they're actually working?""Music and general sound quality: 7/10, pretty decent, although it struggles with cymbals and high-hats.Mic quality during phone calls: 1/10,  Very bad. I made 8 calls, and the people on the other end said they could hear everything around me, and it stifled my voice.Bluetooth stability, the main reason why you buy these: 0/10, these things worked, stably, without the sound dropping in and out, for approximately 20 mins out of the hour I was walking around town. And when they didn't work, I would hear every other syllable, or the sound would just drop out completely.Terrible, terrible headphones. Will be returning.Edit: The customer service and tech support was fantastic for these. I contacted them about the issues and they got back to me in a matter of hours.Unfortunately, Their fix was not enough to save from a very mediocre experience with the headphones. Short version, if you've been using Iphone default line-in headphones and are finally looking for something better, these are perfect for you. If you're an audiophile like myself and are use to line-in bose in-ear headphones, skip these and pay the hundred for top audio and bluetooth connection.IMO, audio 7/10, call quality 2/10, versatility and bluetooth ability 6/10. They're ok.

Update: Does not work anymore (Was: ""They keep going even when wet"")


Update:They only lasted a few months. They simply just don't work now. Wasted my money. Look elsewhere. It's a bit expensive, but Swimbuds have 3 different types of waterproof head phones for the type of water activity you are involved with. I am still happy with my Swimbuds.Original Review:I did really well with this. I kept accidentally going underwater with it during deep water exercise. Just below the surface, but the first time, the USB jack was not closed up and nothing went wrong. I should mention that I wasn't swimming laps with it. It did come off a few times, but not to the level of being annoying. Unfortunately, I've lost it. I now have to figure out if I am going to buy that waterproof MP3 watch for a few hundred bucks or buy another one of these.One thing to note: I did use this outside and the range is limited to 15ft if the mp3 player is not with you. I used my phone which I kept on the side of the pool. If you do use a phone to stream music, attach the phone to a portable battery charger or your phone will start skipping the stream in about 10-15 minutes. It's just trying to conserve battery for all the tasks it's performing. This is an argument for getting the mp3 waterproof watch, btw.

These are the best $37 Bluetooth earbuds I've ever heard!


I am a classical snob and an audiophile and should be ashamed for the thousands of dollars I've spent on high-end earbuds and headphones over the years.  If you've never heard Daniel Barenboim conducting Beethoven's 7th on $500 Shure earbuds, you haven't lived.Snobbery aside, I had a need for wireless headphones for walking in the country where corded headphones won't comfortably reach form the phone in my pocket to my ears, and I wanted to be tangle-free.  I've over researched Bluetooth buds for the past year and most reviews indicate there is no truly good product for classical or natural/acoustic music.  Until Bluetooth technology advances, I didn't want to spend $200 on Powerbeats when every review says they are lacking, especially for classical.I stumbled on these SENSOs on Amazon one evening and was shocked at the huge number of reviews and the mostly positive scores.  For $37, what could possibly go wrong if they turn out to be junk?  No, these don't even approach the quality of low-end Shure earbuds, but for what they are and for what I spent, I am very, very pleased!  The sound quality can best be described as the difference between FM radio and listening to the original CD.  We still listen to FM radio, don't we?How are they for classical?  I'm listening to a modern digital recording of William Alwyn's first symphony as I type this, and the quality is more than passable.  Once you get absorbed into the music, you tend to forget the minor deficiencies in the mid range and high end.  Bass is present but not obtrusive.If you need a decent set of near-disposable wireless earbuds, you can't go wrong with SENSO.

3+ years later still going strong


I am an infrequent reviewer. But I'm impressed with these. I bought these headphones for when I was pregnant and needed a wireless hookup. I've use them consistently for several years now and they've held up to my abuse (being squished into pockets, travel, etc.). The ear piece is built well for longer uses and its comfortable (one of my outer ears is damaged from an accident so its tricky to find headphones that fit).The volume can get pretty loud if needed and still drown out a good amount of sound (noise cancellation) when its lower. The battery charge is reasonably quick and holds well -- I charge mine every few days. Bluetooth connection is pretty easy and I can switch songs and adjust volume easily from the piece.I only have 2 complaints after all these years -- the power button location is the same spot i use to adjust or push the ear piece back in -- so i'll occasionally skip songs or turn the thing off accidentally. Also its REALLY obnoxious if you let the battery get too low and keep trying to listen from it-- its like a seatbelt alarm reminding you to click in... seriously you can't ignore it.... Out of everything they're pretty minor complaints.Highly Recommend.

They aren't perfect either but a better product


Sent mine back - not sure if a product defect or false advertising. There is no noise canceling whatsoever on these. I own several other pairs of noise canceling earbuds/headphones and am familiar with the technology. Also, these are bulky. I ended up returning these and getting the TaoTronics Bluetooth in-hear headphones. They aren't perfect either but a better product.The other issue is that the car charger that comes with it did not work properly. Tried it in 2 cars.I did like the control options on this one.

Buy the Black ones...Not the Red ones!!!


I first purchased the black headphones and they worked perfectly till my dog chewed them to pieces. I then purchased the red one's but they're not of the same quality. Firstly, it takes FOREVER to turn them on/off. Even the voice that says ""power on/off"" is different. I have to press down for over 10 seconds before they turn on/off (with my already paired devices) which was not the case with the blk headphones. The sound is more static than the black ones, and this is using the same devices and same music tracks. They do take over an hour to fully charge but do Not last 8 hours. I fully charge headphones and use them for about  3-4 hours but have a low battery at around 5 hours, and I Always turn them Off when not in use! They are comfortable and had no problems pairing with multiple devices, but I wish I bought the black ones again. For now, these will do until my dog chews them up again, lol!

Not that good for petites!


CONTEXTI think we all know how crappy corded earphones are! Especially for me, because I go running with my dog, they get in my way and sometimes even tangled! I ended up seeing these on a Buzzfeed article and thought why not purchase them? The price was right, after all.PROS- These are very easy to use, just make sure you read the manual first, LOL.- The sound quality on these is actually pretty amazing.- Noise cancellation on these puppies is real! I can usually her cars approaching with different earbuds, but not these.- Obviously, huge pro that they are cordless!- They come with a handful of different ear bud thingies (LOL, not sure what it's called). This was a huge plus for me, because I could choose the ones that fit my ears best.- The part that goes around the ear is adjustable!CONS- While the part going around your ear being adjustable is a pro, it is also a con in that my ears are probably on the smaller side since I am petite. Because of this, I don't get a good fit and they often fall off my ear. :( This is a huge con for me, since I am having to adjust them on runs and sometimes, they even fall off! Super annoying.OVERALLI do like these and think that they work great. However, for anyone who is petite and considering this, maybe look into a different set.

This Second Set is Not Made of the Same Materials!


Below is my original review for a set I bought in April 2018.  The left bud started to get static after seven month, so I bought another pair in November 2018.  These are not the same!  The sound quality is the same.  However, the over the ear pieces are made of really flexible plastic.  So flexible that they constantly lose their shape and easily slide off my ears.  Also the door piece for charging is  made of some kind of really soft plastic so that it does not stay firmly shut.  I normally wear one ear piece in my right ear with wire going around the back of my neck because if I just hang this around my neck it will eventually slide off.  However, with the original pair, if there was any tugging against my clothing, the over the  earpiece was firm enough to stay around my ear.  With this ultra soft plastic, it loses it's shape and just slides off my ear, thereby in danger of falling off completely.  I'm constantly reshaping it to fit over my ears.  The original stable construction was not uncomfortable in any way and, like I said before, the over the ear pieces maintained their shape and kept the earpieces where they belong.  I don't like this new formulation and may have to reconsider another brand, when these wear out.  Maybe they changed the formula thinking that it would give people a more flexible option.  However, the originals were not uncomfortable, fit nicely over my ears and maintained their shape and these do not.  (See my pics).April 2018 Review:I did not buy these for sports so I find them a little large looking and frankly ugly sticking out of my ears.  Yes, if I were running I would look quite fashionable and everyone would know that I was listening to music or some sort of exercise tapes.Anesthetics aside (they are not unobtrusive as noted), these have really good sound quality, even in noisy environments.  I bought these after buying a blue-tooth Nenrent single in-the-ear bud because I found the sound too low in background noise and I use my earphones to listen to language tapes and YouTube videos at any time, any place.  I don't use my phone for music.I did note, as another reviewer noted, that these capture wind noise, so users running or exercising outdoors may not like that issue.  This will not be a problem for me.  I have not yet tested distance with these.  My Nenrent, unlike some reviewers for that product have said, actually has a quite an impressive range.  I can wear that earbud at work without anyone noticing.  These are noticeable so so I don't keep them in at work, but I will test range at work and add to this review.These came boxed quite nicely with a carry-case.  The charger is different than others I've seen on YouTube for the same model and there was no phone charger with this  either as I've also noted in unboxing videos on YouTube.  However, this came with 3 different ear-molds, including  a sweat-proof pair, a device r to attach your phone to your car dash airvent, and a toggle to tighten the cord.  I thought the toggle was missing from my package.  Tried to call customer service, which line was busy the entire time.  So I emailed and got a response within 2 hours with an offer to ship any item missing but to double-check the contents.  I had thought they were earbuds, but they were there (2).  They also came with a stick-on cardholder.Now the test is to see how long they last.  Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend them.  I think the controls are easy and the device material seems easy to clean.  The Bluetooth was a little touchy at first (but maybe it needed to complete its charge), but once paired, the earphones pair up immediately when you turn on the device.  The materials are soft and most people shouldn't have discomfort wearing them.  The device charged fully in about an hour on a computer.One star offfor the wind noise and inability to call customer service, but an A+ for customer service responding quickly to my email.  I do recommend this product.  Oh, and shipping was stellar.  They were shipped the same day as the order and were received the next day!

Great for indoor gym goers, runners caution of wind noise


Great gym headphones at a great price. I researched bluetooth in-ear headphones extensively and decided on these for the price.  The other reviewers are spot on.  They are light, stay in the ears, have really good battery performance.  They pair quickly and without much effort.  Operation is a no-brainer and they keep me in the zone during long sweaty workouts.  The only disadvantages I see are that the rubber plug that covers the charging port is having a hard time staying in after numerous charges and a couple months of daily use.  They are not the most low-profile ear buds, but they are what you should expect for this style of bluetooth headphones.  I've deducted a full star for one reason... Wind noise. I can't tell if it is due to the larger profile of the headphones, or if it is the microphone input but if you are walking fast / running especially into a slight head wind you will hear the rustling loudly.  Like I mentioned, i'm not sure of the exact cause, but it's really distracting, so much so, I'd recommend these only for indoor use.  If you are a runner, you might want to look another direction.

The RANGE IS HORRIBLE!


I use with this with my Samsung Galaxy 8 at the gym, the range is HORRIBLE. The slightest interference will cause the Bluetooth to cut out.Example: If I hold my phone in my left hand down by my side while walking, the bluetooth audio will cut in and out so I have to hold my phone with my right hand. If I hold my phone under my left arm, say if I need to use both hands for something, the audio cuts out. In my left pocket, is also troublesome. Seems to work well only if I hold the phone on my right side.I've since bought the BOSE over-ear bluetooth headphones. I works perfectly no matter where the phone is. I can walk into the next room and it still works. I bought the over-ear BOSE headphones because when I go running it cuts out wind noise. That's something the SENSO does not do, even walking on a windy day.Update: I reset everything and repaired with my Galaxy S9 per SENSO recommendation. Still, reception is horrible.Example: Sitting on a workout bench at LA Fitness. I lay the phone on the floor on my left side of the bench so I could workout. Audio cuts in/out so I have to move the phone to the right side of the bench. Distance in both cases from phone to this SENSO headset, 3-4 feet.Example: Sitting on a bench doing row pulls, again phone must be on the right side of the bench in order to get a good reception. Distance from headset - 3 feet.Example: Walking down the street holding my Galaxy S9 in my left hand, audio will go in/out as my arm swings in the walk so I have to hold the phone in my right hand to keep the audio going.Now I use a BOSE headset. 10x the distance and once while listening to music I walked away from the treadmill I was using and left my phone behind. Didn't realize it until I got about 50 ft away and the audio started dropping out.Sorry to report, I would recommend these SENSO headphones.

Invest in better headphones.


UPDATE#3: Replaced pair having major connectivity issues (cutting in an out of sound with phone 1ft distance) and customer service is unresponsive. I bought another kind of the same headphones and those have stopped working as well, both in less than a year. With the amount of money I spent on these different pairs I could have put it towards better headphones which I'll have to buy anyway.UPDATE#2:registered the product on the Senso website and contacted them regarding the issue and the 1-year warranty. They were very quick to respond and asked for pictures of the damage, and info. they sent a new pair in a manila envelope with no headphone packaging. a bit odd to package it, but so far they work well. We'll see how long these last...UPDATE:9 Months after I purchased these headphones, they broke. The section connecting the earpiece to the rest of the ear set broke. Now I have to push them back together before using. After a few uses it comes out again and I have to push it back in again.OLD REVIEW:Overall this brand has lost quality over time.SHORT REVIEW:-Bluetooth connection spotty-Adjustable over earpiece is a mess-Microphone overall terrible, and unusable if any noise is present-Sound quality and battery life is decentMORE DETAILED REVIEW: I had a pair that lasted 3 years, set in place over the earpiece, and good Bluetooth connection (sometimes I would leave the room and return with the connection still intact). The microphone was not great so I would use it mainly inside, but the overall sound quality was decent enough that it made the headphones decent to use. One day one ear stopped working, so I decided to get a new pair.Bought this pair and have had them for 8 months now. When I got them I immediately noticed 'adjustable' over earpiece was a mess, I have to adjust it pretty much every time it goes over my ear. The Bluetooth connection also isn't very great. Sometimes I turn my head with my phone in my pocket and the sound cuts in and out. This happens often, especially when I'm walking on the street. I have to press down more than once sometimes to get it to turn on as well.I still use the headphones but am seriously looking for a better quality option. If you need quick cheaper headphones this might be good but, but definitely not a long term solution.

GREAT!! THESE PUNCH WAY ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT!


Positives:The sound is EXCELLENT, the BEST of the many different brands I've tried around this price point, including some costing much more. VERY good bass and clear treble; if you're an audiophile, as I am, you might find it's not quite as crisp in the mid-range, but you'd have to pay multiples of this price to do meaningfully better.Note that they are not truly ""noise canceling"" but when the buds are snug in your ear they do a good job of keeping most of the ambient sound out (bonus: you're less likely to get run over if you're crossing the street!). I use these mostly for workouts and they more than meet my needs.Less great:  They don't  transmit my voice on calls as well as some others I've had, mostly when outdoors. I also prefer an in-ear anchor rather than  over-ear loops, but that said, they stay in my ears even during hard workouts. If I'm sweating I occasionally have to push them back in to get a snug fit. But not many others have in-ear anchors, and the ones I've tried have inferior sound to these.ADDENDA03/03/21-The replacement also stopped charging after about 5 months, though it did not overheat this time. And once again they cheerfully replaced the earphones. They say they don't get many complaints of this kind, so I'm not sure it there's something strange about my charging cable. I'm going to switch and see. In any case, I stand by my review. At this price you could replace them twice a year, even if you had to pay for both, and still come out ahead!5/4/20: after close to six months of great performance, the charging port overheated and melted while charging. I contacted the company and was completely delighted with their response-concern and an immediate offer to replace the earbuds, which they did. This company deserves your business and the product overall is terrific. I tried a few others in the interim and always come back to this side. Again, for the money, I cannot find anything else that comes close.

Not that great


I bought these as opposed to spending $200 on beats headphones. These are ok but not up to the hype on the reviews.Cons:1.)The ear piece does not retain its shape so it pretty much does nothing for keeping the headphones in place. In fact it was pretty hard to keep the headphones to stay on. I had tried out my friends beats which have a similar design and those stayed put during running, and crossfit type workouts so I assumed since these had a similar design they would too but they did not.2.)NOT FOR RUNNING. The wind noise is horrible when running in these.3.)Sound quality was ok at first but Ive barley used them over the last 3 months and the sound quality is horrible now. I sweat a lot when I work out so maybe it is because of that but Ive never had the sound quality decrease that much because of sweat in my previous headphones.Pros:1.) The only pro I really have about this product is the battery life. It is advertised as holding a charge for 8 hours but Ive only had to charge these maybe 3 times since I got them and I will forget to turn them off a lot of times.

Just pass on these.


I had an older pair of these that lasted more than. A year. The wire started fraying by the ear piece, so I ordered a new pair. They worked fine until they died shortly after the return window expired. They are cheap so I ordered a new pair. The “your headphones are on” would blow you away with the volume, but despite turning them all the way up with my phone volume maxed out, they were not loud enough. With a fan on in my garage, I could not hear my audio book while rowing. These are being returned. I learned my lesson and have purchased some Jabras on Prime Day.

Sweet sound and long battery life


This review is for the ActivBuds S-250. I like these earbuds very much. They have a long playing time and have a pleasing sound quality. I use them with Comply foam tips which greatly improve the comfort and sound. Comply tips come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and sound isolation and are a positive addition to any buds. One improvement I would  like to see would be cloth braided connecting cable between the two buds. The rubber cable sticks to the back of my neck sometimes and it will dislodge the buds from one or both ears. I usually wear them with the cable in front of my neck and flip it to the back if I am going to take them out. I like these earbuds because the controls are easy to use and are ergonomically designed. The charge plug is easy to put in and the buds hold a charge for a long time. The playing time is quite good and is at least equal to the time claimed by the vendor. All in all a comfortable set of buds with sweet sound. (I also have a set of the S-255 buds and am not happy with the flimsy ear hooks. Fortunately, the Comply foam tips keep them in my ears as the hooks are quite useless.) I have several pair of these buds because I have a number of Bluetooth sources and the buds, like most Bluetooth devices will only pair to two at a time. Bluetooth 5, which will be released any day now, is claimed to allow several devices to pair.

Overall there's too much bass which usually is something I like, but the bass is a bit ""muddy"" and ...


*****Update*****I've lived with these for a few weeks now. I can't wait for them to die. I'll still maintain my 3 star rating, but there are two annoying issues. First is the battery. These may last about a week of gym time. That's 2 hours for 4 days a week on average.  Given the size I guess this is okay, but much worse than the 3 to 4 weeks that my last set lasted. There's also very little warning. You get the low battery notice and you may get 5 mins before it dies.Second issue is that when you sweat a lot (justing the word 'gym' makes me sweat) the band sticks to your back which then works the earphone out of your ear. To remedy that I sometimes have the band in front of my neck instead of behind. Still, it's pretty annoying.Bass is still bad. I was hoping that these would break-in, but nope. I listen to hip hop and these just can't handle it. Strictly podcasts in the gym now.***** End Update*****I ordered these along with the others that look almost exactly the same (aka Treblab, Ranpu, Arkey).Sound quality of these were the most acceptable when compared to those other in-ear headphones.  Overall there's too much bass which usually is something I like, but the bass is a bit ""muddy"" and it effects the mids and highs.  I ended up having to get a global equalizer app on my phone to smooth things out as much as possible.  I primarily listen to podcasts when working out, so the sound is acceptable.  If I listened to a lot of music I'd return these along with all of the ones that I mentioned above.From a comfort standpoint the left side is pretty comfortable.  The right side kept sliding out of my ear a bit.  I'll experiment with the other earbuds, but I think I'm going to see if I can order some memory foam buds.  The Treblab headphones came with some and I really like those.  Other than the occasional re-positioning after completing a workout set the comfort is really good.  They're very light and you barely notice them after awhile.Overall I'm happy with the purchase.  I wish the bass was better and didn't effect the overall sound quality, but for my purposes; which is strictly gym use; these are good.  I'd also like a set of included memory foam inserts, but given everything else that comes with these I can see why they were left out.Oh, the Bluetooth connection is stable and has no issues in my gym, but I'm usually no more than 20' away from my phone.  Again, that works for my needs.

Not perfect, but damn good for the price.


What I like about this headset:- The price is outrageously good for a pair of functional wireless earbuds.- Even the low volume setting is quite loud, which is ideal if you’re running or working out in these.- The sound actually improves when you figure out the right earbud fit and are able to twist/lock them in right. I’m impressed by the sound for the price.- They really stay in place when you have them on; ideal for running!- It comes with a keychain and a hard case, both of which are a nice quality. I love the case, it’s solid and the zipper is surprisingly well made.- The wire in the back is probably not as annoying as you think. I tie it up into my ponytail when I run and it’s not noticeable in the least. Also, I can just pull them out on the go and have them hang around my neck— they’re not gonna get lost like AirPods.- It connects quickly and charges quickly.- Waterproof is correct because I got caught in a thunderstorm the other day and they were unaffected.- People have mentioned that the connection flickers sometimes, but I’ve found the Bluetooth connectivity to be very stable.Some downsides:- The bass, if too heavy at times, muddles the sound. It is definitely not crystal clear HD sound.- There’s a background fuzzy static noise when they’re on. Not noticeable when music is playing but it’s a little irritating.- The battery life seems to be less than 8 hours.- It’s not entirely noise cancelling. Wind especially gets really loud when running.- Getting them on your ears is a tiny bit tedious, and they tend to hurt my ears after a while, so I wouldn’t recommend them for day-long use. For a workout session, or bus/bike commute perhaps.- The little flap for the charger is really flimsy. I thought it was going to snap off the first time I charged it, but it hasn’t.. yet.They’re about as good as it’s going to get for ~$22, if you’re trying to budget. Just remember these aren’t at all high end, and for their price point, I would definitely recommend them if you want a working exercise/commuting headset. I quite like these Senso earbuds and I’m happy with my purchase. They get 5 stars because they’re overall well worth the price. But if you’ve got the money and are ok with spending more, buy more expensive ones.

Does the job


Pros:-Good volume-Adjustable earhooks, three different size eartips-Easy setupCons:-Clarity leaves something to be desired-Buttons are pretty loud when they're next to your ears.I wasn't expecting a whole lot from these headphones; they're $30 after all.The sound quality is... acceptable. Nothing more, nothing less. The clarity leaves something to be desired, but it's good enough for the gym. The volume is much louder than you'd think, so unless you're already hard of hearing, I'd recommend keeping it pretty low to start out with. I'm pretty sure they don't have an active noise cancelling function, but the volume takes care of that on its own.They stay in my ears well enough, and the earhooks are adjustable, which is a nice feature. They also come with three different size eartips, so they should fit most people without an issue. I will say that the buttons are extremely loud/clicky when they're in your ears, so beware of that.Overall, for $30 headphones, the sound quality is about what you'd expect, maybe a little better. The fit and adjustability is clearly better, though.

16 months later


I bought these about 16 months ago. I’ve  used them for everything from exercise to garden/yard work to computer work. They stay firm and comfortable for me.They have been very durable for the price. A little bulky looking at first, but they have great battery life. I still get over 8 hours from a full charge.Unfortunately, it’s time to replace them since the wires have developed a loose connection from wear and tear. No complains, they have been well worn.The only negative marks I could give these are there seem to be a few bugs in the firmware. This can cause disconnects and difficulty connecting. Nothing a headphone/Bluetooth reset can’t fix. This may be fixed in current versions.Also these a VERY loud. Even the quietest volume is too loud for casual listening. I fixed this by stuffing a tiny cotton ball in them. Though... at times the excessive volume is a great feature... like when drowning out loud kids :).Overall ... I’m very satisfied with price, performance and durability.

It's ok for the price


It's ok. I thought about returning it but I need a set now and can't be bothered looking for another one.  So, I'll keep it.The package didn't come with extra eartips or the wire tie like it says on the packaging. Not sure what the wire tie is for so I didn't worry about not getting that but extra eartips would have been nice to have. It came with a cute round zipped pouch tho.It says wireless up to 30ft but I lose the sound few feet away when I go into another room. May be I have thick walls but my previous headset allowed me to walk around the house and even to the basement and back without sound interruption.The cable that goes around the neck is too stiff...it digs into back of the neck when walking or jogging and pulls to one side with movement so I have to keep pulling it away to center it. The ear hooks pop off if the eartips aren't jammed into ears firmly. The battery life is crazy quick I didn't get 8 hours like it says. May be the one I received has some issues but it certainly doesn't hold up to the promise it says with its description.I am not super happy with it. It just does the job for now, but I will not buy this again and I will not recommend it to a friend.

Will NOT last 10 months


I truly loved these headphones, and on many levels and still would if...They would last for one year.  They do not and will not and I am so disappointed.I bought the first pair in 2018.  Before a year was up the headphones would no longer work.  One side started cutting in am out until that side no longer worked.  Fortunately, they offered a 1 year warranty so I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement pair.  I registered the new pair on their site for the 1 year warranty and now...9 and a half months later guess what?? The replacement pair continuously cuts itself off every 30 seconds-2minutes.  I have followed the instructions for resetting them, disconnecting them from my device and “forgetting” them and reconnecting.  I have spent a lot of time trying everything to get them to work and they just won’t.  I contacted the seller again, mentioning when I registered the new pair and they said sorry, since it was a replacement pair I wasn’t eligible for the warranty.  They didn’t tell me this when I registered this pair.I won’t be buying again.  I would love if they could have lasted for JUST ONE YEAR, but I guess that’s how they get you.

18 months of Awesomeness!


Bought 2 the s250's in Feb of 2018. Here we are in August of 2019 and both pair still perform flawlessly! My husband listens to audio books all day at work, 5 days a week. About 4 months ago, his battery began only holding 6 hours of charge instead of 8... but hell, they were over a year old at that point. My pair are used for a couple hours at a time for Pandora mostly, while I tend to my yard. I drip sweat like crazy while mowing, weed eating, washing the cars, pulling weeds, etc. They never slip and never fail me. Can't hear anything but the music, either. I prefer the foam ear covers because I have really small ear canals, and even the smallest set of silicone ones would make my ear ache after an hour. My husband prefers the medium silicone ones. I also us the buds as my hamds-free for the car a couple times a week. Sound is crisp, clear, and loud. I recommend only putting in 1 while in the car so you can still listen for emergency vehicles. All in all, these ear buds are still in excellent condition after a year and a half. However, I will be upgrading because they didn't have blue yet when we bought ours. If you need a great, durable set(I have 4 kids) for a great price, definitely get these.My only con is that the metal plate for your phone to magnetized to the dashboard has some real weak and crappy adhesive. Get you some gorilla glue!

Good for the price


For the price I paid, its not bad. But its not entirely to my satisfaction. I have cycled through plenty of headphones over the years. I mostly use them while running and working out. This Senso headphone is clearly a knock-off of the PwrBeats3. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. The good things: The bluetooth pairing is simple and straightforward, charges pretty quickly, does the job for most part when you wear it while running or doing other things. The bad things: (1) too bulky an that curved plastic thing that goes behind the earlobe doesn't always conform to the ear. Its just some cheap plastic. It cannot be molded or fitted to your ear.The buds seem to protrude out of your ear like big pods and make you look like a sci-fi movie character. (2) Its not really sweat resistant. Sweat will go inside and spoil the sound for you. (3) They always (especially the right side one for me) seem to come out of the ear or move out and you have to tuck them in every few minutes. (4) my dual pronged charging cable is essentially useless because the connector that's meant for iPhone or iPod doesn't actually charge the device. I don't know why they bothered with it! The other connector that charges the headphones works fine. (5) no noise cancellation. None of the headphones I ever used were 100% noise cancelling but this one is on the lower end of the spectrum. I can hear pretty much all the noise around me. (6) the sound quality is average. But I wasn't expecting it to be great in the first place. Overall, I think that this headphones is fine for the price they charge. I can't say much about how long it will last. Pretty much all the headphones I have tried over the years stop working after a year, and I have tried both high-end ones costing 200 dollars and cheapens selling for  20 dollars. I am yet to find a headphone that actually ""works"" for the purpose of running and working out.

Great wireless earbuds, BUT not without issues.


Pros:1. Sound quality for bluetooth headphones is fantastic especially at the given price.2. Easy connection and no troubles when re-connecting3. Battery life is outstanding, the batteries will last longer than you should have earbuds in for any single session.4. Secure fit and multiple silicone pieces as well as a set of foam pieces to fit different ear canals.Cons:1. Volume up and down buttons are small2. The strain relief for the wire going into each earbud is not sufficientSummary:Loved the headphones and got some really good use out of them but recently the right side is cutting in and out but not entirely, if the wire is moved slightly the sound volume and tone change is noted, there is clearly a loose or intermittent connection going on there and for that reason the headphones are unusable.  If the strain relief was better or the internal connections were better I think this problem could be mitigated.  They were always carefully put back in the case and never abuse or had the cord pull or jolt significantly to either earbud.  I am a little disappointed that they are inoperative, but would consider purchasing again, perhaps a solder joint was just a little loose on my set.

Beware Customer Service


Ordered my first pair of these headphones and they worked well for a month or so. You need to charge them pretty regularly if you use them every day for an hour or so. I would say every other day if you workout every day. After a month or so my headphones just stopped working - they would not turn on and no light came on when plugged into the charger. I contacted customer service and followed their instructions to reset, but that did not fix the issue. They sent me another pair because it is still under warranty. The same thing happened after a short usage time. Again I contacted customer services, but now they are telling me I have to send the earbuds back to them, at MY expense, so they can see for themselves what the issue is. I asked for a shipping label weeks ago, and still have not received a response. I tried countless times to reset and charge these earbuds but that did not work. They are good for the price and decent for working out - that is, when they work! There are so many companies out there that sell similar earbuds at comparable and even cheaper value that have higher ratings. I may write this company off altogether, but hoping they get back to me soon to resolve the issue.

3rd pair


Update: just went to charge these for the first time and the charger does not stay in.  I tried another one I’ve used before, same problem.  So the cost for this air is down the drain.  Try the charger as soon as you get them.  I didn’t and now can’t return them.This is the 3rd set of these I have owned.  The only reason I replaced them is that I lost the last 2 pairs. I need the over the ear piece because that is the only way the stay in my ears.  The sound quality is excellent, but still allows me to be aware of my surroundings when I am out walking.  I highly recommend these.

Just perfect!


I'm way behind the times.... And these are my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds.All I knew was that I wanted to vac the house and listen to music without having to carry my phone/with old school audio jack earbuds plugged in... Lol.I figured sports style ones would be hassle free (not fall out easily, have the cord to prevent falling to ground).I couldn't be more impressed. The countless positive reviews about this item are accurate (and certainly more detailed about the tech aspects than I know about)... Lol.I'd highly recommend! Either for yourself or to gift. The box they came in was high end, packaging was stellar. The storage case is well made and really set this product apart from other similar earbuds. A small mesh pocket within case securely holds all the additional earbuds included. They included bonus gifts like a cellphone mount (magnet) and a cellphone pocket (to attach to cellphone to hold money or credit card). As for comfort/sound... I'm no expert. But they are quite secure and have excellent sound quality...even over the sound of my vacuum! Lol...

Pretty pathetic. BUT


Having read the reviews on these I expected a little more. Even though they are $30, I can't get over certain things. I have a very similar and identical looking product. Silicon Volcanos. Even same black and red color. But there are major differences. I purchased a second pair because my Volcanos hardly last 3 workouts of battery life. Pretty pathetic. BUT, they are much more comfortable than these Senso's. The over ear piece on the SENSO's is not nearly as comfortable or functional. They are a stiffer rubber than you can essentially bend to make them fit tighter. I have mid size ears and they did not hold snug or fit out of box. My Silicone's I didn't have to touch and the over ear piece is a much more ergonomic, flexible rubber that is comfortable and functional. I don't know why, but the chord is also more stiff and thck andlays to the right side. When i turn my head a certain way it pulls on one ear. Its very annoying. Yes, they provide chord ties, but I don't need them for my other pair. Just holding in hand, they are heavier. Once wearing, they aren't comfortable and very noticeable that they are there vs my other pair which you almost forget you are wearing minus the music playing. They really are night and day.Finally, the sound. Its clear. Thats all I'm going to give it. There is zero bass response with these. Better than having bass distortion, but lowish bass notes are non-existent. But, the sound is clear as I said so they perform for a $30 set of headphones.All in all, these will be my backups. If I didn't already have a very similar pair and know how a better pair fits and feels, I wouldn't know better. But I do. I just wish my other pair had a better battery life than 4 hours or so. But it beats dealing with chords. I would choose the Silicone Volcanoes over these just for the comfort factor. Sound is about the same with slight differences.

Solid pair for the price, though my pair didn't last much longer than a year before dying


Bought these a little over a year ago. They lasted about 13 months before they completely died. Started with one earbud not working and then about a month later the headphones wouldn't turn on. While they were working, they were a pretty solid pair of headphones.Pros:- Good sound quality for the price, though a bit heavy on the bass- Battery life was great and they charged quickly- Rarely had a problem connecting to laptop or phone (with one exception listed under cons)- Comfortable- Stayed in my ears well while working out and running (even with jump roping). Multiple ear bud size options was key.- Volume was great, either balancing via headphones or via my phone/laptop.- Good rangeCons:- Connecting to multiple items (i.e. laptop and phone) at the same time caused both connections to stutter and lose connections. It was pretty much impossible to connect to two things at once, though I rarely needed to- They didn't last much longer than 13 or 14 months even though I took great care of the pair- Nearly useless to use for phone calls. The other side of the call had a lot of background noise and even when that wasn't present (such as in a quiet room), I was told I sounded far away and could barely be heard.Ultimately, I would buy them again and they're worth the price.

I feel bad giving this only 3 stars


I feel bad giving this only 3 stars. But it's literally that...okay. Most of the time it works well. The sound is great. I love that they give you 4 different sizes of earbuds; the memory foam ones are perfect for helping these hold on while I run the treadmill. There isn't a wire-hitting-your-neck noise while you run as long as the volume is up high enough. And the volume does get loud! The bass quality is surprisingly good.So now lets review what makes it okay:I was bummed the ear holders weren't adjustable. I am a petite woman with tiny ears. It takes a bit of finagling and the memory foam earbuds to help keep them in place as I run.The battery has slowly gotten worse as time has went on. Not only that, the little case that comes with them to keep them in sometimes turns them on without you knowing, and the battery is near dead the next time you use them again.Lord help you if you're more than 20 feet away from your phone. Even weirder, if there's a *person* between you and your phone, it'll start cutting out. Hopefully the person is just walking by and not stopping to stretch.There's no ""low battery"" warning. It just stops working.

2021 Purchase Update


I bought these headphones in April, 2017. They worked fine. I'm not picky when it comes to sound quality. But I noticed recently that the thin wire that goes into the right ear plug is fraying; the black plastic covering is ripped and you can see the small metallic wires. After 4+ years of minimal use, I guess I can't complain. I'll duct tape the wire and hope that will solve the problem.

UPDATE:  Several issues -- but customer service was immediate and seemed sincere. Stay tuned.


I like these -- when they work.  Too often I can't get them to connect.  Sometimes turning off the Bluetooth on my device and turning it back on will allow a connection, but not always.  I can't tell if maybe the connection issues get worse if the battery charge is low.  Speaking of the battery charge, it will drain just sitting and powered OFF.  I fully charged them, and then unplugged them from the charger but didn't use them for several days.  When I went to use them they were pretty much dead.  I really don't want to leave them plugged in all the time, as I've heard that's not good for the battery, so I feel a bit screwed.  Finally, when they are working, I occasionally get some static or crackling through them.UPDATE:  I have already heard back from customer support.  Impressive--this alone made me give them an additional star.  They asked me to do a factory reset.  I will do that and test things out for awhile.  For now, I rebooted my computer and eventually was able to connect and I'm listening to music now.  I have to say, when these things work they are truly AWESOME.  I hope the factory reset fixes my issues.  But if not, I feel confident that they will replace them with no hassle.

Request a replacement if anything goes wrong


After about 6 months of using the product on and off while running, the ear Senso buds would simply turn off on it's own. I contacted Senso, and they asked me to try resetting. That worked, but the ear buds still shutdown while I was running. I am a fairly patient person, so I kept resetting my ear buds, until I finally got tired of it and contacted Senso again (after the 1 year warranty period was over) to request for a replacement. Senso admitted that sometimes they have defective products that allow moisture to enter the electronics, causing performance problems, but they would not replace the ear buds because the warranty period was over. They knew I contacted them after about 6 months of use for the exact same problem. So here's my suggestion to you. NEVER try to be nice to Senso by trying out their suggestions to fix problems. ALWAYS request for a replacement the first time you experience a problem with the ear buds.

Great Earbuds!


I've had these Senso headphones earbuds for almost two weeks. They are the greatest! Easy to charge and the battery lasts quite awhile. These are my first wireless headphones so I can't compare them with others. I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. They are comfortable and the ear buds fit my ears well. I have small ears so I was worried about the fit but they not only stay in but they're comfortable enough to wear for hours. Listening to music is a pleasure because I can hear all the instruments so the arrangements really come alive. The volume buttons are easy to learn to manipulate as is the fit of the earbuds in my ears. This weekend we drove round trip from New Jersey to Ohio, a 7 and 1/2 hour trip (actually a little longer with stops). With the earbuds I could listen to my music while my granddaughter who was driving could take phone calls on the car Bluetooth and talk to her 2 year old in the back. Best of all, when the 3 year old was cranky I could tune her out. Taking out the left ear bud to talk while listening was easy. Another thing I like is the cord is not long so it's not dangling all over the place. And the black color makes them blend in well with my clothes.The earbuds and extra buds come in a great zippered case that is very attractive, small and easily fits in most purses or pockets. I should mention that I'm a very active 78 year old great grandmother whose kids, grands and greats keep me up on the latest technology. I am very happy with these Senso headphones and I recommend them to anyone.

Not what they used to be


My previous pair of these finally gave out after years of service.  Unfortunately, whatever the current version is pales in comparison.For one thing, the voice (on/off sound, etc) is unbelievably loud.  My advice is to not have these in your ears when you turn them on and off.  This voice is equally as loud even when the Bluetooth sound is all the way down.Further, I think they’re limiting the volume much more than they used to.  These new ones aren’t as loud as the others.  Additionally, the bass is extremely overbearing and makes the sound quality even worse.Long story short, I would avoid these until they address these issues. There are other wireless earbuds in the same price range that don’t have these issues

Doesn't last long


My wife and I both use these and have tried both the red and the blue. Sound is decent and controls are easy enough to use. But they don't last very long. Between the 2 of use we are on our 3rd set each in 4 years. Each set progressively lasted less time then the previous set. Different issues with each one. Wouldn't turn on, sound cut in and out, powered off randomly on its own, range suddenly got very short. On our last sets the voice that would tell you if you were connected was very loud and unpleasant. We keep getting these because reading reviews of other products doesn't sound like we would have better luck with something else in this price range. Also doesn't sound like if we paid more for something else that it would last longer.

Comparable to Beats or JBL gym Bluetooth


I had Bluetooth Beats before this.. and JBL before that. These are easily comparable in sound. Definitely just as loud I live in Houston and my gym is in a warehouse so I’m sweating constantly. I mean I’m realllly sweating and these things have lasted a couple of months now and show no signs of failure like my others have. They stay charged longer than my beats did. I’ve charged mine not even 10 times now and I’m working out every day. No one told me to write this review. I knew if they were doing great I would write a review after a few weeks.Cons - the ear piece can bend around your ear, so for ME* when I’m running I have to have the chord around the front in order to stay on when it’s windy or I’m running fast. They don’t fall out if I wear them this way so that’s not too bad. Secondly, when the battery is low, it will warn you and they did quickly after within minutes. * just be sure to charge them once a week or so and you won’t have this problem.

Has A Few Problems


I've been a fan of the older version of this product for a few years.  I think my first pair lasted more than 24 months of regular gym-going a few days a week.  They were an amazing fit, and once I found the right cushion for my ears, never fell out during vigorous use.  I did have issues keeping two devices paired.  The voice that came on for connected/disconnected can be problematic if you range out of the second device.  It was annoying.  But I also noticed intermittent, momentary sound interruption on my listening device when it was paired to both.  So I only use them on one device.The left side of my old pair eventually failed (an honorable demise), so I replaced them with this new unit. In this version, I've had the same intermittent sound issues when pairing two devices.  The connected/disconnected voice is still present, but... okay.  I had some very big issues getting them to stay in my ears as well.  But I later discovered that the over-ear armatures have a wire in them, and between that adjustment and some wear I've made the fit tolerable.  There is a bigger issue though in this new pair I have.  These devices periodically loose Bluetooth connection to my tablet: usually at 5-10 minutes of listening, and then about every 20 minutes thereafter.  I do not have the same issue with my other Bluetooth headphones and the same listening device (an iPad).The negatives now outweigh the advantages of this product, and I am likely to look for a different make in my next purchase.  I appreciate the price point of this device, and my experience with the older version was fairly good.  But I find this new version far more irritating.

Better than Beats...but lifetime is short


I've had these for close to a year. The sound is clear and crisp, and unlike several Beats headphones I've tried, not muffled. I made the mistake of following the crowd and buying beats in the past, only to have to return them twice (two different types). These are much much better, and you can't beat (pun intended) the price deal. Customer service was also great when I made inquiry. And delivery was sooner than expected every time I ordered (I ordered some for friend)(UPDATE)Although the sound quality of these headphones is great, soon after writing my last post they stopped working--shutting off sporadically, even when fully charged. I contacted the seller and they were super nice and sent another set. The new set worked well, but about two months ago I had to stop using them for phone calls because persons on other end complained that they couldn't hear me when on the blue tooth. Last week I noticed they started shutting off sporadically, just like the first set, and I haven't had them a full year.Although the sound quality is good, it seems that there's a defect with the design of the product, given my repeated experience.I downgraded to 2 stars from 5 to give credit to sound quality (when working) and customer service, however, the best product is no good if doesn't perform as it's supposed to

Really, really good headphones -- with one little ding...


Impressive value for the money. Excellent sound quality, and good battery life (so far!) I have been wearing Shure 215 wired earbuds for years, and while these aren't quite as good as them they are good enough that I'm not saying to myself, ""Gee, I wish I had my Shures instead of these."" I am also a pretty avid runner, and an audiophile...so I want good quality earbuds to stay put while I'm in motion. And that's where this would be a 5 star review, if Senso did two teeny tiny things to improve the product: 1) perhaps make the earfins a little more wide, to stay put behind the ears better, 2) while 4 tips are included (3 silicone of various sizes and 1 larger memory foam), include at least one more memory foam tip. In order for me to make these fit as comfortably as possible and not slide out of my ears, I actually needed to snag a set of smaller memory foam tips than the ones included from a different headset -- and, voila, perfect. As with any in-ear monitor, fit is crucial to make sure you're getting the full range of sound -- if the tip isn't snug against your ear canal, you'll lose all kinds of bass, and drums will start to sound like rice krispies. So I'd say Senso should make the extra effort to give customers as many options as they can to get the perfect fit right out the box, and toss in a few more tips. If that increases the cost by a buck or two, it's still (IMO) a terrific deal.

Decent headphones, but some charging things to know about before buying.  And a couple of 2-device pairing issues.


Fairly decent headphones, particularly for the price.  I'm mostly listening to talk, not music,  but the music is not bad on here. My complaint with them is that (per the manual) you shouldn't leave it charging for too long -- you kind of have to just watch it and unplug it when it's done charging (when the light turns blue).  It's easy to miss that.  They say they don't recommend overnight charging.I like that this will automatically connect to two bluetooth devices (Phone and tablet in my case).  It's a bit of a hassle to set it up initially -- not super intuitive -- and devices have to be paired in the correct order or the button will send a ""play"" request to the wrong device to pull your music/audio from.  But honestly,  once you figure out the setup quirks for multiple device pairing, it's fine.Also -- if you have two devices paired (tablet and phone in my case) but then you walk out of range of one (such as, I leave my tablet in my car to walk in a store but I have my phone in my pocket), the headphones will give you a really horrible choppy audio experience as they try and try and try to search for the 2nd device.  Also, if it is expecting to pair to a 2nd device and the 2nd device is just not there, it will do the same choppy audio for the 1st device for a minute as it searches for the 2nd device.  A little annoying, but forgivable for some headphones that are wirelessly transferring audio from my phone via magic.

Poor Quality - updated


I'm on my second pair of these.  First ones lasted fairly well, second ones died today, one day after the 'warranty' ended... That's just wrong.  Looks like it is time to explore a different brand.  Update - I contacted Amazon who contacted SENSO support.  24 hours later there are a new pair being shipped to replace the faulty ones, that is all I can ask for!  These were my third pair of SENSO buds.  The first lasted two years being used for working out every day.  My wife has the second after about a year, and they are working just fine.  I'm very pleased with the support, no hassle, a response via email came about an hour after they were contacted.  Had me try a reset (which is good to know for future reference how to do), and when that didn't work they shipped me a new pair.  The sound is very good and they work well for my purposes.  Performance plus the support and I'm going with 5 stars.  and then 5 months later, same as the previous pair, dead.

Decent Sound & Fit w/these but Poor Highs and Spotty Bluetooth Reliability


To begin with the positive, I like how these Bluetooth headphones fit - they are snug and fit nicely into my ear and stay put no matter what workout I am doing.  They hold a charge for nearly a weeks worth of 1-hour workouts and are built well.  Now onto a few disappointments - for me, these headphones don't have great frequency range between highs and lows.  The treble is a just not what I expected from a set of small, compact headphones.  That being said,  they do provide a decent amount of bass.  Definitely more depth than iPhone earbuds but not nearly the crisp highs.  One other annoying problems seems to be degradation of Bluetooth connection.  After a day or so of being connected to my iPhone, I get these annoying double beeps, about 15 seconds or so apart, which interrupts what I am listening to.  The only workaround I have found is to completely remove the Senso Headphones (which show up as Activbuds S250 in my Bluetooth devices by choosing ""Forget This Device"").  I then have to reconnect them in by Bluetooth device list.  This seems to work for a day's worth of use, however, the next day when I go to workout....same problem.  After researching a bit, it seems as if the double beep warning is a battery warning, however, this even happens when the headphones are fully charged.  A very annoying glitch as far as I can tell.

Not impressed


I bought these headphones based on many thousands of reviews, and after using them for some time I still don't understand why they are highly rated. The earbuds fall out constantly, no matter what size insert I use. I bought them specifically for the gym, and every time I lie down, sit up, lean over or generally move, one (or both) ear bud(s) needs to be placed back in my ear. I rarely use these anymore largely due to the frustration factor of them not staying put. Also, by ""sweatproof"", the manufacturer clearly means ""sweat phobic"", because at the first bead of sweat anywhere near them, the headphones come out of my ears and will not stay in, no matter how much I try.The ear hooks are also gigantic and not pliable. I'm reasonably certain that my ears fall somewhere in the ""normal"" spectrum for size, but the ear hooks are completely useless and provide no support for holding the earbuds in place. The size of these probably adds enough weight to the earbuds to contribute to them falling out of my ears constantly.Sound quality? Pros: They do block out much of the outside noise, which allows me to keep the volume lower. Cons: I could best describe the sound quality as ""extremely muddy"". Not bass-heavy, but there is a huge low-mid range EQ boost that makes everything sound unclear at best. The sound quality was supposedly one of the best features, especially when compared to (much) higher-priced Bluetooth headphones, but in my experience, this is not at all the case. Perhaps the other headphones sound equally terrible.The microphone transmission quality is garbled and basically terrible. I tried to answer a few phone calls while wearing these, and the callers could not hear/understand me. I had to hang up and call them back using my phone every time.Battery life is great, I'll admit. I've only had to charge these once! However, that's also partially because I became so frustrated with these falling out, and disenamored with the poor sound quality, that they live in my gym bag, unused. But I did probably manage 8-9 hours of use before I had to charge them.They do work consistently and have a good range, and the accessories are decent.Caveat emptor.

Failed in Six Months but Replaced Quickly


Latest Update: I sent the company a note via their website's ""support"" tab. They replied quickly with a procedure to reset the product. It did not work. I emailed them to let them know. They sent me another pair in about 5 days. That's great customer service in my estimation. I hope this pair performs for a longer period of time.______________First Update: After a good experience (see original review below) for 6 months, the right side has now failed. The controls still work but the volume is about 5% of the left one. Being vigilant about taking care of them is not enough; I did that and still they need to be trashed in 6 months. No longer recommended. Very disappointing.______________Original review: I've purchased expensive (>$100) wired earphones for years, being overly concerned about sound quality. This is my first pair of Bluetooth earphones and I'm almost shocked not only at the sound quality at this price level, but how well they fit. I've gone running with them and used them at the gym for several days and find them to be excellent. On the gym floor, I'll get occasional, momentary dropouts since there are often another 30 people running Bluetooth signals all around. Except for that, these are highly recommended. Note: it too me several days to get the cord between them just right (cable management clips are included). Battery life is also impressive. So far, it's been about 7-8 hours for me. Highly recommended.

wireless earphones


Pro:Packaging was impressive and fair, as far as the extra materials given for the earphones and case to store the earphones.length of wires were appropriate.  Easy to figure out how to turn it on and Bluetooth to a device.  I didn't read the manual and I was able to connect to my Bluetooth.  Once on, sound quality was fair to good for the everyday person.  I'm sure if your a pro, you can pick up the little differences when compared to others.  At this time, battery life appears to be very good and recharging with a speed charger is great.  The ear bud component that goes into the ear feels very comfortable, and it doesn't feel like its going to slip out when walking around or sitting.  Haven't tested in the gym or jogging.Con: charging cord is very short; loops that go over the ear is toooo big.  It was made for someone with big ears or at least made for men.  The loops can sort of bend back behind your ears but it could have been constructed a little smaller.

Functional Headphones


I end up needing a new set of wireless headphones every 6-8 months (in most cases it's from heavy/rough use rather than the headphones itself) so I get try a lot of different brands.This pair works perfectly well as a cheap Bluetooth headset and I use it regularly around the house. The sound quality and battery life are both standard and I haven't noticed any actual defects in the manufacturing.There are two things I'll single them out for.First, the ear hooks are extra long and flexible. This may be a plus for you, if you find that other hooks are too short. I don't have that issue, so this ends up actually being a little bit of an annoyance, because every once in a while they'll get stretched and then I have to reshape them around my ears.The second thing- and this is pretty minor- is that unlike other brands the power jack's cover doesn't pivot: it's simply a flap that lifts up. This just means that it takes a little bit of extra effort to keep the flap out of the way when you're plugging it in. I haven't had an issue with the flap wearing out or falling out of the charger, which is good.Bottom line: these are very good headphones for $20 with no significant flaws.

Excellent quality, great sound, and best costumer service I’ve seen so far.


I bought these wireless headphones on September 27, 2018 for my iPad Pro, whose headphone jack had stopped functioning properly. When they came the packaging was nice, intact, and everything in it was undamaged. The instructions manual is very clear and pairing the headphones to my device was a breeze. They worked plenty better than the 20 dollar non-wireless headphones I had before.They lasted until February 2019, when the headphones didn’t turn on after being reset and fully charged. Costumer service was very quick to respond. I received a free new replacement since there is a year warranty.What you need to know:-The quality of the wireless headphones and bonuses are great- much better than what you’d expect for the price.-The connection didn’t cut for me unless the headphones ran out of battery or I completely covered the sides of my iPad. I can stand a good 20 feet from my device without any disconnecting or decrease in sound quality.-I used these while running on my treadmill at my house without problem. They didn’t fall out and connection didn’t cut.-They do a good job cancelling out unwanted ambient noise, although that ultimately varies depending on how noisy your surroundings are.-I can put these on after just minutes of getting out of the rain/shower and the water seems to have no effect on them.-Very good battery life and recharges quickly.-Great price.-Great warranty.-Great customer service. Best I’ve seen so far.I highly suggest you buy these. Very good product.

Very solid headphones, maybe not for audiophiles, but work really well


I've had 2 pairs of these now for a couple of years and I recommend them to friends.  I wouldn't say they are great sound quality but they are certainly good enough for me.  Some people complain about the microphone but all in all I think it is more than adequate -- especially since the microphone is back by the earbud.  I get hours of battery life out of them although these days (2020) when we are in our homes, I am happy that I have 2 so I can charge one since I'm on them all day.I really hated the over the head phone which gave me a headache all of the time.  These are very comfortable for my ear shape and stay on.  I've also done limited running with these and they work really well.  They stay in place well and I immediately forget that I'm wearing them.  I bought a similar looking set from another manufacturer and the rubber around the earpiece is just too hard.

Small Ears Beware


So generally, I have to say I really like these headphones, especially for the incredibly affordable price I paid for them. The sound is great, with the caveat that they really have to be right in your ear to get the good sound, otherwise it sounds a bit hollow. This might just be a me problem as when I've gone to try to purchase more expensive wireless headphones in the past, I always have to tell the retailer that my ears are small and shaped much differently than the ""standard"" ear. They never believe me, and then are surprised when it falls off. The hook on these headphones helps mitigate that issue, but it's still a bit of a problem for me. The hooks can adjust, but are too big for my ears. Nevertheless, they do the job. Hold charge for a few days and work for what I need.

These are complete trash


These things are awful for doing anything more than sitting at a desk listening to audio, and even at that they fail pretty miserably since they're so uncomfortable.  Save your $20.Pros: Bluetooth seems to work fine, but so have all devices I've used in the last 5+ years. Comes with a case to protect them (good, so I can protect the next pair I buy).Comes with a wallet holder for your phone (which is subsequently trash). Comes with a magnetic car mount for your phone (why do I need that with bluetooth headphones?)They are uncomfortable, ugly (stick out ~1"" from your ear...), the ear hook is made from foam that will be permanently disfigured after the first time it bends, but it doesn't actually do a good job of holding anything to your ear (and then go back that they stick out really far, the weight is all pulling out of your ear). They do a bad job at blocking out other noise, regardless of which size ear piece is being used.Forget trying to move with these things in, they'll fall out of your ears almost immediately.Not even worth returning this item.

Great sound quality and bass reproduction in an affordable / comfortable design


I've now purchased 3 pairs of the Senso Active Buds one S-250 and two S-255. We use them with our smart phones and tablets, we use them at the gym while working out and on the go when we have to wait somewhere, like a plane ride. The sound quality for the price is excellent and the bass reproduction is strong. They come with a hard case, charging cable, 3 pairs of ear cups and 1 pair of ear foams for form fitting and sealing out surrounding noise.Customer service is superb. We had one pair that began to shut off when the connecting wire was bumped. I contacted customer support and received a response within 30 mins giving me suggestions on resolving the issue. I followed the steps, but unfortunately, they weren't successful. I contacted support again to let them know and within 30 mins they had responded again and stated they would replace the unit since we were within our warranty period. I'm a business owner and I can tell you from dealing with a lot of companies where I needed support for a product, this has been by far, one of the best and quickest responses I've received.When the time comes to upgrade or replace, Senso will be at the top of a very short list of options. You won't be disappointed in this product or it's customer service, should you need it.For those who have complained about the sound quality, they simply need to make adjustments in their devices. I come from an audio/video career background, so I can speak to the quality. There are options out there that may sound better, but you won't find them even at double the price of the Senso's.

No one seems to make good-quality earbuds any more.


My wife got these for me for Christmas because my old, $16 (like 25 year old) Sony ear hook buds finally fell apart. I've been writing a book and using Speechify for editing, using these earbuds. Initially, I liked that there were different sized silicone pieces to fit different size ear-holes. The sound quality seemed fine, and they were a bit bulky, a bit loose, but seemed not bad for $20. So now (1/10/21, or 17 days later) the charging port broke loose from the solder joints which affixed it to the little printed circuit board inside. Anyone who knows anything about wiring and electronics can tell you that a solder joint on a circuit board is inadequate to secure something that is going to have pressure put on it repeatedly due to plugging and unplugging. Obviously no one at Senso thought of this, or cared enough to put it into practice.This is all part of a larger problem which is what is known as 'planned obsolescence' or put simply 'making things cheap so they break quickly (usually just after warranty expires) and you have to buy another one'. It's happened to phones (buy a new iPhone every 2 years), audio equipment, cars, televisions, and computers (don't get me started on the crap Dell sells, and forget getting any support from them).AMAZON, if you're LISTENING, stop selling CRAP from SHADY SELLERS!  Stop allowing companies to bribe customers for 5-star reviews.  It makes reviews worthless and untrustworthy. Also, your buyers are obviously getting kickbacks, or if not they are terrible at judging quality. Either way, I cannot find good Bluetooth earbuds anywhere on the site.  Even the Beats audio ones you sell for $110 are lousy with quality issues.Disappointed, AMAZON. You own the internet but you can't sell quality electronics to save your lives.

Had 3 pairs – They last about 6 months until they suddenly stop working


I’ve had three pairs of these now.  Each stopped holding a charge at about the six month mark.  Unfortunately, there was almost no indication the failure was coming, so they’ve died on me out on a long run (while traveling no less) and in the middle of workouts each time.  Obviously, I’ve kept buying them.  At the price, it was a bit simpler to just get another pair vs. taking a chance on a set multiple times the price with questionable reliability.  However, the third pair is my last – time to give something else a shot.In fairness, for a little over $20, quickly shipped to your door, you get a decently usable set of headphones and a useful magnet mount phone accessory.  For what it is, it’s crazy cheap.  But with that, it will eventually fail on you.  Just know what you are getting and have some kind of backup (e.g. wired headphones).

More recent model works better than previous one (c.Jan2017)


This purchase replaced an earlier model (purchased Jan2017).  Here are some notes:- earpiece - the current model seems a bit more firm (less squishy) than before.  so far ear comfort after extended wear (>1h) has not been an issues, but i have not yet tested other eartip sized- over the ear tether - the current model is a lot better, feels less flexible, which i think is good as it provides a better anchor around/over the ear during running and other vigorous activities.- sound quality - works well.  i'd say better clarity than previous model i had- connection - seems to have some minor issues with static if my phone is across my body.  Assuming the BT radio is in the right earpiece, I get static and degraded sound quality when the phone is on the left side of my body, whether on an armband, or a waistpack, or in my left hand pocket.- battery - my old one seems to be running out of battery earlier.  not sure if it is the normal degradation of the battery or something else.  With the new one, haven't tested beyond 4h, but have had no issues thus far

WORTH EVERY PENNY


Pros - The headphones is very light weight and I do like the flexible ear hooks because I don’t need to worry about a break from an accidental bend. On the right buds is where the controls to change audio, skip songs, answer/end phone calls, and turn on/off resides, which do feel comfortable to reach for whenever I need to use it. The extra earbuds that is supplied is essential for different ear types. The battery is more than long enough, from when I bought it to now, I’ve yet to charge it. The cord between the buds look a bit “flimsy” at first glance but appears to be a durable cable, and the sound is more than sufficient to my liking. Lastly, as a bluetooth headphone, it sells for great price compared to pricy options out in the market. The car charger and lightning cable bonus are pretty great as well.Cons - As mentioned, the there are three different extra earbuds to come with this as I’ve tried all three to find a “perfect” fit. None of which really “locked in” nice and firm and I would find that sometimes my buds are rotated forward or backward (These are all subjective). HOWEVER, I had ZERO issues of it falling off, especially when I’m doing cardio or running a few games on the basketball court. Secondly, I’ve had minor issues of detecting the product via bluetooth, on my phone, even after following directions for pairing and/or resetting. After sometime, I’ve connected it to my iPhone 6 and my MacBook. Third, connectivity. As advertised, it does remain connected up to 30ft and sometimes a bit after. HOWEVER, I’ve had many instance when my audio would be “breaking up” as if signaling is affected. This would happen whether my phone is directly in my pocket or on the side of me during a lift of cardio session. It happens randomly but it is not enough to deter me from my activity, however, a minor nuisance. Regardless, I can’t say my issues with the connectivity is consistent with all other units with the numerous positive reviews on this product. But these are cons pertaining to my experience with my specific unit.Conclusion - For the price I paid for in comparison to other pricier options, this is a excellent purchase. I do have a pair of powerbeats 2’s and these activbuds work just as well as them. I would recommend these buds for individuals looking for headphones of quality and not looking to make a dent in their savings. The cons that I’ve experienced is not enough to be suggestive of unsatisfactory purchase. Overall, I am satisfied, trust the other positive reviews, and at worst, you have a 1-year warranty and EXCELLENT customer service.

About 20/1hour sessions, 6wks. Pooped out.


They were working fine, they did cut in and out a bit but for the bargain I wasn't too bothered. They just died on a run in about 40 minutes into a fully charged battery. They make a '2- boop' tone when trying to turn them back on, plugged in or not. It also shows a blue indicator light for fully charged as soon as I plug them in. 2 weeks outside of the return window too. Pretty frustrating. I wouldn't recommend these, very highly.Edit 10/19/17 (next day) if your headphones just poop out mid use.. **So while plugged in, hold the button for seven seconds and that will initiate a factory reset, then unplug and attempt to re-pair to your device.** this did in fact reset the buds and they work again!  Customer service got back to me super fast with help and asked for my Amazon info to get me into their warranty system so that was a relief too!  I see these things are 20 bucks now instead of the 35 I paid a month and a half ago.. Lol I'd say go for it but get them registered with senso and read a few of these reviews to get an idea of what you have in these.I'm just glad I can put off getting a new pair for another bit and I might actually get another for only 20 bucks. I get sweat all over these things so I gotta wonder if they eventually get a little in there but oh well. I see reviews on much much more expensive sets and it's exactly the same as these bargain brands so idk. Good luck ear budding out there!Edit #2 10/19/17 customer service is definitely worth a 5 star. I think I said in here it looks like reviews are similar for these no matter how high the dollar amount.  So I'd have to change my mind and highly recommend these with the caveat of them being definitely what you pay for. Decent. Customer service, to notch.

Good for the price so long as you aren't too picky about sound quality


Great for the price, these headphones hold enough charge for my full week of 30-45 minute daily workouts. Included with the headphones are a cable and a car charging port, but these accessories are poorly designed and of shoddy quality (the car charger fell apart in a couple weeks). The sound from the headphones is certainly louder than other wireless sets I've owned, and that includes sets costing three times as much. Sound quality, however, leaves much to be desired. The bass is strong, but it is also muddy. The mid and high tones are hollow and make most music sound distant even at high volumes. These headphones are great for workouts if, like me, you tend to go through several headphone sets a year. I would not recommend for casual listening because of the poor sound quality.Update: dropped a star because the headset died after just 5 months of use. This short lifespan is probably to be expected with such a low price, but a better headset might be worth the investment if you need a headset for any significant length of time. I did notice that the headset I bought to replace these did not have nearly the volume nor the bass that these offer.

Good Product but Battery Life Expectancy is not Optimistic


I've purchased two pairs. The first was June 2017 (Red) and the second pair (Blue) in September 2017.  I bought the second pair so that I could keep one charged while using the second pair.They get 4.5 stars.I didn't purchase these because I'm an athlete so can't say how well they work in regards to exercise.  However, I used to run and bike and in my opinion, I do believe, if I was still doing those particular activities, these would be better than any other earbuds I've owned.Due to illness I'm pretty much sedentary at the moment so I use these to watch TV and I listen to alot of audiobooks through my phone or computer. The length of the books I listen to range from 5 hours (short story) to 65 hours (for a series).  Listening to them at night helps me fall asleep. Plus, living in an apartment with thin walls, my wearing headphones while watching action/sci-fi movies keeps the neighbors from banging on the walls when they aren't as interested in hearing the space battles, gun fights, and car chases as much as I am.Every other earbud or headphone I've purchased has caused outer ear pain after wearing them for a couple of hours. I tried to make sure I took the earbuds or headphones off before falling asleep. Most times I fell asleep with them on and then woke up in an hour or two with outer ear pain. Being a side sleeper only made it worse.The first time I fell asleep with these earbuds in, I woke up 5 hours later and had zero discomfort.  I've listened to some lengthy books (the page turners you don't want to put down) until the battery ran down and then switched to the other set of earbuds to continue listening without any discomfort.  I've taken a break, shut off an audiobook or TV, and forgotten I even had the earbuds in.Noise cancelling isn't great. My new neighbor upstairs likes to crank up her stereo occassionally on weekends.  These earbuds don't cancel noise but they do reduce the noise by about 30%.(Side Note: for my dumbest noise test,  I recently purchased a VitaMix blender and wanted to know hese earbuds would help reduce/block any of the sound. A Vitamix blender can generate a lot of noise. In my test, I turned the Vitamix on to level 10 (highest) and I could only tell a very small difference with the earbuds in versus when they were not.  Of course, I could turn on the Vitamix to level 10, walk 150 feet outside of my apartment and still hear it (without the earbuds).  I know these earbuds aren't made to block that level of sound but was curious and as I mentioned, it was a dumb test.)Now for minor (to me at least) complaints.  As I mentioned, I purchased 2 sets, 3 months apart.  Another reason I bought the second set was to try to avoid wearing out the first set from extended use.  I constantly switch in between the earbuds.The first set (Red) is still working fine with the exception of the battery life.  In less than 12 months it is down to only holding 5 to 6 hours of charge.The second set (Blue) battery life is about 7 hours.  However, the right speaker's volume is only about half the volume of the left speaker. I clean the earbuds with alcohol wipes daily for hygenic reasons so there is nothing clogging either the earbuds (or my right ear). It just suddenly decreased in volume about 2 weeks ago.  I checked it with multiple audio sources (audiobooks, music, phone calls) and it's the same for all of them.I have an  Android phone from Google that I use for night and sometimes day listening to audiobooks.  The bluetooth range before I start breaking up is pretty decent and I only have a problem in one 2 square foot section in my bathroom. Moving 1 foot in any direction clears it.  The signal only has to travel through, at most, one wall in any other part of the apartment which doesn't present a problem. Outside I don't have any problem listening or talking 30 feet from my phone.I had to buy a special bluetooth adapter for my Windows 7 computer in order to get a signal since Windows 7 didn't have the latest and greatest bluetooth version. My Windows 10 laptop didn't have the same problem. I have had some issues with synching requiring me to power of the earbuds or the device I'm trying to synch to, and sometimes both, before I make a connection. 98% of the time it's not an issue.One positive feature of these earbuds can also be a minor annoyance at times.  The earbuds can communicate with two devices so if you let your earbuds connect to your phone, so you can receive calls, you can also connect to another device (i.e. TV) and watch a movie.  The problem is that it seems to be a ""first come first synched"" situation.I have my Android Phone, Windows 10 laptop, Windows 7 desktop.  If they are all producing a Bluetooth signal, and I power on the earbuds to use with my phone, the computers seem to be able to synch with the earbuds fastest, but not always.  Sometimes I'm trying to connect to my laptop or desktop and either of those devices will tell me they can't connect.  Since the earbuds only tell you that they've connected, but not to what, I have to shut down the bluetooth on all 3 devices and then turn only the one or two on so I get synched to the devices I want.  Minor annoyance only since I've ""mostly"" gotten used to it.I've worn these (carefully) in the shower a few times to see how well they worked and they seem to be pretty water ""resistant"".  Sound quality for what I use them for is very good.  I listen to music occassionally and, while I'm not an audiophile, I'm happy with the sound quality including bass. I've even heard some instruments on some orchestral arrangements that I'd missed on regular speakers.For me, comfort and wear time is 80% of what I look for in earbuds/headphones.  These get 4.5 stars for that.The other 20% is a mix of battery life, sound quality, device quality, ease of use, price, etc.  I've deducted 1/2 star because of the progressive decrease in battery life.  I expect there to be a gradual decrease but I didn't expect there to be an almost 40% decrease in 11 months.  Also, the right earbud volume failing is annoying but, for audiobooks it's not critical. I haven't looked to see if anyone else has mentioned an issue with the battery life.  As long as it doesn't decrease any faster then I should still have a usuable product for the next year.  After that, it will just feel like I'm using an earlier generation that only had a couple of hours of play time.But, if I need replace a set, unless something else came on the market that was considerably better and less expensive, I would buy these again.

Good value, not so good bass, overall okay.


8 Month Update:  Still working, the right earbud feels like something is rattling inside when I start out jogging but it seems to quiet down after a few minutes.  Batteries still hold a decent charge and the sound quality improved a little since I first purchased them, the bass is still weak but a little more pronounced than when I first got them.  For the original purchase price they seem to have been a decent value. In the past my ""sports"" corded headsets (which cost about the same) would have been having issues after this long so these are doing well in comparison, no regrets.5 Month Update:  I've owned these now for over 5 months and use them frequently while jogging.  I stand by my original review with a few items that are worth adding based on use... 1) The ear clips are floppy and while they do hold the earbuds in place they aren't strong enough to hold the earbuds over your ear if you remove the earbud from the ear canal (example: Sometimes I may want to run with just one earbud, but there's no convenient way to do that).  A firmer/stronger clip would be a welcome change for v2 of this product.  2) The low battery warning is annoying.  It doesn't come on until you have about 5-10 minutes of battery left and then it alerts very minute telling you the battery is low.  It'd be much more useful to come on at say, 1hr left or 20% battery and then not be so repetitive.  On the plus side I only seem to have to charge about once every 6hrs of use and that keeps me out of battery jail.  3) Over time the left earbud seems to pop out from my ear a bit more frequently, especially if I'm running at a faster pace.  4)  If you want to listen at very low volumes, note that it cuts completely off at the 1-2 level.  Sometimes I wish I could get it to go a little lower than the minimum before it cuts out, I have other bluetooth devices that work fine at the 1-2 level.--original review--These are a good value, for the price you get the headphones, a lightning cable that has a micro-usb adapter, another short micro-usb cable, and a DC charger with 2 usb ports, and a case.  As for sound quality, they have a nice tone in the Mids and High range, good spatial / atmosphere, but the Bass is very lacking.  I can hear lower sounds but it's very soft and weak.  I have other earbuds and headphones that are much better overall sound quality, but these are the first bluetooth set I've tried.I saw a comment from their customer service about a factory reset to improve the sound.  I removed them from bluetooth settings on my phone then  plugged 'em in (while off) and held the button for 8s like they said, re-paired them with the phone and it didn't make a difference to sound quality.I've worn them running a few times now and they are fairly comfortable.  The right headphone makes a rubbing sound from friction or something (it's not in the audio) that's annoying.  Battery life seems OK so far.

Price for performance is good


For the price and performance, these aren't too bad. I bought them mainly for their water resistant quality. I use them only for exercising, and I sweat a lot. I always rinse them lightly after using them.I bought these April 2017, and they've started to have problems this April 2018. The sound in the right ear is really low compared to the left ear. I work out about 4-5 times a week, mainly in a gym. I think the failure is in the rubber battery flap which is really flimsy.I always set headphones at a hearing level that allows me to hear what's going on around me to maintain awareness of my surroundings, but also to ensure I'm not blasting my eardrums out. Sometimes when I run in windy conditions, the wind can get caught in them, so they're not air tight.I'm not crazy about the fit, but I've yet to find headphones that fit perfectly and comfortably while I exercise. If you have hair that can tuck behind your ears, these will not stay on well because your hair will keep the loop that hangs over the ear from staying on well. You'll either have to pin your hair back or not tuck it behind the ear. Also, I sometimes have to move the wire a little from one side or the other on my shoulders when I'm sweaty because it sticks to my skin and starts pulling on the ear buds.The over-ear loop helps keep the buds in, but once you get sweaty from working out, they do have a tendency to start slipping. I find that by about 15-20 minutes of intense running and working up a sweat, I have to start pushing the buds back in and tucking the over-ear loops in again.Bluetooth pairing is super easy and works perfectly every time. The buttons function perfectly every time.When looking at much more expensive bluetooth headphones, they seem to have equal complaints and problems so I figure why pay that much more for something that will probably last only about as long as these?

Bluetooth range is terrible


The earbuds are great for general use, NOT good for sport.....I use these usually when I'm going around town shopping.  I also used them at the gym when I am lifting.  They are excellent for all of that.Any sort of obsctruction gives these problems though.  When I am riding around on my skateboard, with my phone in my pocket, I get bluetooth interference.  Music keeps cutting out for a second every 10 seconds.  After awhile it gets very annoying.  When I am working out outside doing pushups/pullups with the phone just about 10 feet away, same thing.  Even if I am just walking around.I don't know what it is about just still and inside that makes these work but not outside with minimal movement.  This has happened on 2 phones, so the only constant are the earbuds.  I don't know why walking around the grocery store is fine but walking in the park is not.  I have tried other earbuds and they do not have that problem.

Decent bluetooth earbuds, BUT...


First, BUYER BEWARE --  these puppies aren't $170 bluetooth earphones. Direct from Senso's website, sensoshop.com, they're listed as $49.97. Clicking the 'Purchase On Amazon' button takes you this listing. I think a $120 discrepancy in it's product listing is almost criminal. It's makes you think 'WOW, SUCH A GOOD DEAL! 80% OFF!!' -- not so much.Now, for what you DO get, $37 ain't too shabby -- carrying case, 3 sets of different sized eartips, two different length charging cables (micro USB and Lightning!) and a car charing lighter plugin unit thingy which has a 2.1A and 1.0A USB slots. The headphones themselves we're SUPER easy to pair up to my iPhone and in less than 5 minutes I had music playing and the controls figured out.My only other complaint beyond pretending they're regularly $170, is that they don't fit quite right in my ears. When playing I can tell they should sound GREAT, but I have to shove them deep into my ear and rotate them around a bit to hear it completely. I tried all three size eartips with the small being the best fit, but, still wasn't perfect. Not the manufacturer's fault, but I've had a ton of 'in-ear' earbuds and these, so far, have been the worst fitting. Maybe it's my ears. Aside from the ear canal fit, they absolute will stay on your head. I gave them an intense shake/headbang/thrash around test and they stayed on perfectly; no slippage.I think they're claim of 'up to' 30 feet of bluetooth connectivity range is a wee bit inflated, however. I left my iPhone in a room and went into the next room at a distance of 20 ft and the signal started to cut out. However, I can't see where I would be listening to these and not carrying my phone with me, so it's not really an issue. Might be for some if you intend to leave your phone on a charger or something and working around the house. Not gonna happen.I bought them specifically for the gym, so I'll update my review after a few workouts and see how it handles the sweat and wear. Overall, PROS: they sound pretty good, every easy to use, quick to connect to my device. CONS: These aren't $170 worth of tech, eartips don't quite fit right (for me).UPDATE: Dropped a star from my original review. Headphones now get to 30% battery (as indicated by the battery meter on my iPhone), I get repeated warnings of low battery for a minute or two then they shut off. I power them back up, connects with the phone -- still shows 30% battery remaining; headphones shut right back off. Looks like if I'm going to use these any longer, I will have to charge them daily. Boo.Update 2019: 30% battery remaining REALLY means 0%. This has remained the same since day one. I’ve got burned at the gym a few times thinking I have enough to get through a one hr workout. Not the case.

Great sound quality. Easy to use. Best bang for your buck but I'm having trouble connecting to music app


I waited to write a review just to see the longevity of it. The sound...AMAZING. They're not producing quality as I'm used to but they get the job done. Most wireless earbuds aren't truly noise cancelling unless your music is on, which they were. I'm satisfied with having the sound on medium.The buttons are easy to use and function well. The extra features, as the charger (having both an iphone and android output) is WONDERFUL. I already have the car charger so I can't say how I like that but it was a very nice plus. As for the incoming and outgoing calls, not the best. If I try to redial the last person I called, it sometimes calls the wrong person, and the microphone does NOT work, which is my only reason for 4 stars. The battery lasts me a whole workout session and then some (which is about 2 hours) and I love that it tells me when its about to run out of battery at the top of the screen. I would attempt to return em to get the microphone function to work but they weren't the reason why I purchased them. I just wanted comfortable headphones to workout in!Update: it's been an extra two weeks since I first posted and I'm starting to have trouble connecting. My phone will tell me it's connected but through a Spotify or pandora app, it won't play through the earbuds, just outloud. I try to connect and reconnect but seems like it doesn't work. Waited about 20 min and tried again and it worked. So not sure how to best fix this

Poor build quality makes these otherwise great headphones worthless


I REALLY want to like these headphones. The sound and fit is fantastic (for the price). The headphones also lasted a LONG time without needing a recharge and always recharged fast. I even bought a few pairs as gifts for other family members, as I was initially VERY impressed.Fast forward a few months, and there are some problems. The bluetooth pairing is getting weird, and is no longer convenient or automatic. About half the time, you have to go into your bluetooth settings and make your iPhone forget the device in order to get these headphones to actually connect to the bluetooth. Another issue is that these headphones no longer hold or take a charge very well. They aren't lasting nearly as long on a charge, and it's becoming normal for these headphones not to charge fully, regardless of how long they were plugged in. My headphones, specifically, are dead because they will not take a charge from either provided cable.All in all, they're not really worth the price. Poor build quality makes these otherwise great headphones worthless.[Update: I emailed Senso about my issues and concerns. An actual person replied back, on the same day. Senso support is great to work with; I’d give them an A+. After checking a few things, Senso decided to send me a new pair of headphones. I received that new pair within a week of my last contact with them. I’m excited to see how long this pair lasts. I updated my star rating to reflect this.]

great value


I bought these headphones a few months ago when I gave my mother my airpods.  I wanted something cheap that I could use for several months while I decided what I wanted to do on replacing my airpods.  But when I started using them, they worked great.  The sound quality is exceptional especially for the price paid.  I haven't tested the 8 hour battery life yet but I have used them for 4 hours straight.  The fit was so good that I had no problems having them in my ears for that long.  I've also used them on video conference calls and the other parties could hear me clearly.  I like them so much that I will not be buying any other headphones.  The only thing I didn't like about them initially were the hooks until I figured out they bend to fit behind your ears.  Not one of my best moments.  So I highly recommend this product.

My third Pair


This is my third pair of these so I obviously like them.  The design has changed a little, and this pair seems to be a little too heavy on the bass.  I am critical of audio quality having spent thousands of dollars on my home audio speakers.  It seems to me this can be remedied by switching the foam earpiece around.  Other than that I've always liked these.  They get pretty loud, but not so loud they will damage your hearing (I hope).  I like how they fit, and I actually really like that it has a wire connecting the two headphones.  I don't like ""truly wireless"" headphones because I want to be able to hang them around my neck.  Sound quality is probably 3-4 which is important to me, but at this price, VERY easy set of volume and ""skip track"" controls, really good and simple connection to my Android phone, and great water resistance (I sweat like a pig at the gym and have ruined other pairs), these are a real value purchase.

Great Bluetooth headphones, awesome customer service!


I have been using my Senso headphones for almost a year now and I have very much enjoyed using them.  The sound quality is excellent and  is well distributed from highs to lows.  They can work for two or three days without a charge.  They fit well on my ears and have never fallen out during a gym workout, walk, bike ride or a run.  They came with a nice set of ear tips so as to fit the earbuds to the size of the ear canal.  Also includes a well-make hard-shell travel case.Yesterday, I noticed some crackling in the left bud.  I got in touch with Tekatron customer support this morning (Saturday) and, believe it or not, they responded to my email within an hour or so.  They suggested a hard reset which unfortunately didn’t fix the problem.  But when I wrote back to them - once again they responding within the hour or so) they told they would send me a replacement.  There are not that many tech companies that give you such immediate and excellent customer service, especially when a product is almost a year old.I highly recommend the Senso Bluetooth Headphones for you listening pleasure while on the move.  Also know that Tekatron just an email away and you will get top-notch customer service.

Less than acceptable sound quality


I was optomistic these would be great earbuds as so many reviews stated they were a great price for the money. I would have to disagree and here is why...Pros first1) Style, they look good2) Materials- Feel fine don't feel cheap with the exception of the ear tips3) Functions and connectivity- I have had no issue with the buttons housed on the earbuds or the bluetooth connection with my phoneCons-1) SOUND- The most important part of this to me is sound... The sound is almost distant, I feel like even though the buds are in my ears it feels like the sound is traveling a distance to get to me. It also sounds muffled. Yes I have owned beats in the past and they sound much much better and yes they are much more expensive but even my earbuds that have come with my cell phone like my Ear Pods sound much better. Very disappointing.2) Fit- I have tried everything to get these to feel like they are secure on my ear but the band that goes over your ear is very loose and wiggles. They don't fall off but it doesn't make me feel like they are not going to. Also none of the earbuds fit well. They make popping noises as they move in my ear due to the cheap material they are made out of.I didn't have high expectations for these, I just wanted something with clear sound with a good ear fit. I realize these are not premium bluetooth buds but I can tell way too much of a difference from the sound difference to enjoy these.

Great sounds and value for the price but I'm disappointed in their long term durability


These headphones were great when they were new but they're starting to fall apart after months of regular use.  My only but significant complain about these headphones are that the flexible earpiece is no longer holding its shape.  Now these ear buds are too loose so they won't stay on whenever I'm running.  I first noticed that I had to keep adjusting them when I was running but now I've given up and they just sit loosely and don't make a secure seat on my ear.  I really liked these when I first got them and I want to buy a replacement set but I'm nervous that those will fail as well.  Granted for what I paid for them I definitely got my money worth.The audio itself sounds good with a decent amount of bass.  It's not the absolute best audio quality compared to a nice set of studio headphones but music and voice calls definitely sound clear and nice.  Very good quality overall.The included accessories were a very nice touch.  The package came packed with extra goodies that manufacturers skimp out on these days.  This was a great value.The earbuds, when newer, fit perfectly on and in my ears but have definitely gotten too loose over time.  The sweat resistance is definitely a nice quality of these earbuds as well and they were perfect for outdoor activities.The range was surprisingly good on these as well.  In an open area I could get well over 30 feet of uninterrupted range.Overall these headphones are a great value for their price but I'm disappointed in their long term durability.

Ok, but with issues I don't love


For the price, great earbuds.The good: The sound is good, in call sound is a little harsh. They connect fast and easily every time. They hold a charge for a long time. They are loud and reduce outside noise ok with the well fitting earbuds.The not so good ""but I can live with it, probably"": Wearing them is kind of like driving a first generation car that is now 4 or 5 generations old. They're blocky, chunky, and one side sags a bit. But, you own it free and clear so you drive it with pride. Or whatever. The weight of the earbud drags on the flat wire that connects them to each other, so if I have just one in, the other pulls down and prevents me from moving freely. The on/off/control button requires a good hard press that your ear and head will definitely notice. The ear loops are flexible and moldable. That's good for different shaped ears. it's not so good when they stretch out during active use.If you are looking for good, reliable, cheap earbuds and don't mind the smell of stale french fries and a slightly worn driver's seat in order to get the retro-cool look and still have performance, you'll probably love these for what they are. If you are looking for a 2019 Tesla on a 1990 Prelude budget, they might still be ok. But if you just want the Tesla, get something else.

NINTENDO DS BLUETOOTH EARBUDS


Summary:  Very bad for money and sound qualityPros:- Comes with a boatload of accessories- Is Bluetooth- Good for exercising- Has bassCons- Sound is let say not pleasing.  Reminds me a bit of a Nintendo ds included earbuds.  Remember those?  The sound is very murky, it’s like listening to music playing in the room next to you.- Button configuration could be approve (accidently called a sleeping person, they weren’t in the best mood as many of y’all would’ve been)- The earbuds would loosen a bit while running.I bought these for running and they do the job pretty well.  They come with very nice foam eartips that are like complys.  The cable isn’t annoying while running.  The only complaint is that they may loosen up.  This is the first time I’m using the kind of earbuds that loop over your ear and these are pretty comfortable.  The earbuds don’t smell at all unlike several other earbuds I’ve encountered.  They come with a huge assortment of accessories that has me wondering why include this!?  I’m not complaining though.  The sound quality isn’t good at all.  Very murky and leaves me unsatisfied.  My 4 year old $30 earbuds somehow sound a indefinite times better than these.  My cheap $10 parasonics are high end in comparison with these.  The bass is there, however, it’s not the good quality bass.  I’ve gave my cousin who is only famailier with apple earbuds and he called these alright.  From someone who has never touch another pair of earbuds in his whole life just called these OK isn’t very ok.  My cousin isn’t very sensitive to sound quality like me since he thinks apple earbuds are the best of the best.  He got excited when I offered him some 0.99, possibly fake Samsung earbuds.  He lost his apple headphones and is probably sick of the sound.  I too would be desperate for a pair of possibly ripoff  earbuds instead of these.

Form and function need harmonizing


I read many of the reviews and my main buying points were: sound quality, comfort and ease of use.They score a 5 on sound quality - it's what you want, full bass, clear pitch and you hear all the good thumping sounds of house music (my choice for workouts). Comfort - I'm still working on that.  Once  I finally get my earbuds in (I always have to use a mirror to figure it out which kind of annoys me, if not I always miss putting them on right) they fit pretty snug, don't hurt and seem to stay in well.  I have now used them on  several long walks, hikes, and at the gym doing all kinds of workouts. It beats not having the wires hanging from your ear but sometimes the one that is attached feels funny, like if they made it shorter that might work, or have it  toggled so you can adjust the length to your comfort level.  I don't need all that extra wire hanging around! That also falls into the design aspect of which I have some wishes for future development.  Shorten or toggle the wire.  Is there a way to make the black ""box"" smaller so it looks less conspicuous on your ear?  It's kind of detracting to have these black boxes protruding from your ears - something flatter and  smoother looking would be nice.  As for the battery life - well there is no signal or warning to let you know the battery is low which is a bummer, so I'm making a habit of just charging it all the time to make sure, so an alert mechanism would be really helpful.  Like on my Fitbit, I know when the battery is low.  Also make the opening to the charging cable bigger and easier to see - I have to put on my glasses to see the microscopic opening and every time I feel like the flap is going to tear off it's so thin.  I guess it's a lot to ask for the price but hey in today's super hyper technical age, these requests just seem like they would be natural and easy to fix..  I think I will keep them - but the jury is still out on the above mentioned technical issues.  Not enough to return them but that's why I didn't score them a 5

After buying these I’ve realized, I need AirPods.


I was very excited about these headphones. I hate working out with headphones connected to my phone. I hit the wire when running on the treadmill and make my phone go flying all the time. First time I used these I was amazed. So happy to not have my headphones connected to my phone. But now I’ve realized I need AirPods. I bought these because the hype around AirPods seemed ridiculous. But after using these headphone through multiple workouts they don’t stay in my ears. The wire gets stuck to the back of my neck when I sweat and ends up pulling my headphone loose on one side, then the sound isn’t right because one side is in tight and the other is loose so it’s not noise cancelling anymore just on one side. I’ve tried tightening the wire in the back, I’ve tried all four earbud sizes and types it comes with but I still find myself pushing them back in my ears constantly. And the pause button is on the side so when I push it back in my ear I end up pausing my music. I tired putting the wire in the front and it doesn’t pull out of my ears as much but it’s annoying to run with the wire hitting my chin and my chest. I’m bummed. I’ll keep them for flying or listening to music on the train. But I’m gonna need AirPods for working out.

Looks well built but disappointed with the sound, too much bass, little clarity


Just bought a bunch of varied earphones. Some for myself and for Christmas gifts. I actually got one of these for myself encouraged by the reviews. The good side, nice packaging: the cables look durable and not prone to tangling unlike others that are flimsy. All the accessories that come along are impressive. Now the sad part, the sound was disappointing. I don't know if I got a defective unit, but the sound was far from good. It was just so thick that there was hardly any clarity. I can't help but compare to other earphones I bought which I tested as well. I listened to various genres of music and I like testing with some selections that have fine subtle instruments in the background. The others I tried would reveal the subtle instruments crystal clear in the background, but this one didn't. The higher frequency sounds were a bit towards a muffled sound. It's like all the sound, mostly lower frequencies, were compressed into a small space, unlike others wherein there was a sense of space between instruments. Sad because this looked like the most impressive and sturdiest earphone I got but it had the least desirable sound.

Sound Quality is Amazing!


So these things, for them to be as inexpensive as they are, they work and they work very well.Some of the Pros:The foam earbuds are super comfortable in your ear and you can leave them in for hours.The sound gets pretty loud and really can drown out anything around.The bass is very present.It also comes with replacement earbuds that are rubber if you want those or a different size.The battery life is pretty longBecause of the foam earbuds and them molding to your ear shape, it blocks out a good bit of the outside sound.Some of the Cons:As with all foam earbuds they get dirty and fast. Haven't found a way to clean them as yet, but that's nothing a google search can't remedy.The mic is iffy, some people say they hear me clearly, some people say they can barely hear me, but everyone says that my volume is lower.The actual plastic that wraps around your ear is uncomfortable and it hurts after some timeSometimes the bass can be a little muddy.Sometimes the range is iffy too. At times I can go pretty far, other times I can't go more than 2 ft away before it starts cutting out.I don't remember If you can skip forward and back with these, I'm thinking not unless I just forgot how to do it.All in all they're definitely a good contender for some of the higher end competition. With a few minor updates they could be the best headphones yet I'd buy them again and again.

Great Bluetooth on a Budget, Taotronics Comparison


Pleasantly surprised by these headphones!  I figured I would give these a try before dropping a bunch of money on one of the overpriced name brands.  I really dislike earbuds because they never stay in while working out.  I chose these because of the wrap around ear section hoping it would help keep them in place.  I'm happy to say these fit perfectly and stay in place when walking, running and lifting.  Sound quality is very good, better than I would expect at this price point.  Audiophiles may be able to critique the sound quality but for the casual listener you'll be very pleased.  I typically charge these once per week and have no problem getting 6 - 7 hours out of them.  I like that they have a battery indicator that shows on phones with the latest Bluetooth.  The only negative that I can report is that when running outside in the wind these get some annoying wind noise.  This is only a problem it's quite windy and you are running into the wind.  Overall I'd say these are great bang for the buck and I have no intention of dropping $100+ on headphones I can only imagine are marginally better.Taotronics Comparison:  Prior to purchasing these I boughTaoTronics TT-BH06.  These headphones are considerably better.  The Taotronics I found uncomfortable and hard to keep in.  Also the bluetooth signal on the Taotronics were considerably weaker and would sometimes break up when my phone was in my pocket.  If you are looking for budget bluetooth these Sensos are the right choice.

Great sound quality, but issues with Bluetooth connection


After reading many of the raving reviews on here, I decided to give these a try. However, I am now returning them.Reasons for the return:1. I've had them for a little over two weeks and have already had issues connecting them to my devices. In the first few days, the headphones connected quickly to a computer, iPad, and phone. Then, after about a week, there were periods of time when I was unable to connect the headphones to my phone. I would reattempt the connection, turn the headphones on and off again, turn my phone's bluetooth on and off again, but I continued to receive an error message. My Fitbit, however, had no issue connecting to my phone during this time. I decided to give the headphones the benefit of the doubt. This issue, unfortunately, continued periodically over the last two weeks with both my phone and my computer.2. I found the sizing of the ear hooks to be a bit big for my ears, causing them to fall off during my runs.3. The microphone quality seems to be poor. When I have answered phone calls using these headphones, I have been told that I sound very distant and that all of the background sounds are amplified.I have still given these headphones 3 stars because it seems like my experience is not a common one among the reviewers. Also, though I am not an audiophile, I did really enjoy the sound quality with these headphones. Finally, they also come with a decent number of useful accessories.

Excellent Sound Quality, Battery Life, and Comfort


I've been using these headphones for a few months now.  I bought these specifically for working out.  The features I was looking for was Bluetooth, ear hooks, sweat proof, a low price point, and I wanted a cord between the ear buds, so that they could hang around my neck if I took them out of my ears.  This set was one of the few good reviewed headsets that met the criteria that I was looking for.The sound quality is surprisingly good.  The key to the sound quality is making sure you use the right ear buds to fit snugly in your ears.  The sound is quite balance between the highs and the lows.  The sound is very clear, and there is good bass and mid-bass.  The comfort is good too.  The picture shows three sets of different sized earbuds, but there is a fourth set that are memory foam earbuds that come with.  The case is nice too.  It's a very convenient way to store the headphones and its accessories.The battery life is very good too.  I've only gotten to low battery once, so the claims of eight hours of listening time seems accurate.  I charge the headphones just once a week.  The only thing that would be more convenient would be if the charging port was USB Type-C.  I can't comment on the microphone or call quality, as I've only used them for playing music while working out.  Overall, I can't believe how good these are for the price point, and I am very happy with my purchase.

Excellent until they stop working after 2 months


**update***Issue resolved, hassle  free even though  I had them beyond Amazon primes return guarantee.Customer Support is excellent. If you are having issues with these not working  or you didn't get an item listed on the packaging, message them  immediately.  Among the best support around.Very happy!They were excellent at first the packaging was excellent the accessories that came with the headphones were very high quality I appreciated the foam ear pieces they were comfortable and really reduce the noise in the background. They work well in calls as well as sounded very well with my music. However, after 2 months I could no longer get the headphones to charge. The red LED light no longer lit up and they would no longer accept the charge the headphones would become warm as if they were charging but when I tried to use them it would always tell me low battery. I contacted Amazon Prime support and they were very helpful and getting me in cobtact with someone who could assist me with a repair or replacement because I had already passed beyond the window of return through Amazon. I'm really hoping that the seller or the manufacturer can make this right because I enjoyed these headphones a lot and it was an Amazon Choice product which led me to make the purchase and I want to continue to trust items that I see marked as Amazon Choice items. Up until they stopped working I was fully prepared to give them a 5-star rating based on price vs quality. I will keep you updated on my progress with the replacement or repair process and based on my experience with that I will update my review.

The sound is ok, but talking on the phone is impossible.


The sound is great and talking on the phone is fantastic. The battery life is excellent and they charge very quickly. The reason for two stars is the connectivity. It appears the Bluetooth sensor is in the right earbud. It loses signal when my phone is in my left pocket. If my phone is in my right pocket, it will lose signal if I lay my hand on my phone. If I am sitting and looking straight forward while my phone is in my left pocket it works fine, but if I look right I lose connection. This issue is a deal breaker. I plan on checking them on my wife's phone before I return them. I also plan on doing an exchange for a new pair (just in case this is a faulty pair) before outright going for a different set altogether.EDIT: I ordered a second pair to see if I just got a bad set. The mic is even worse on the new ones. I have to completely disconnect to answer phone calls.EDIT #2: I ended up keeping them in spite of the mic not working and using them only for music during my workouts. They almost made it 1 year before the left side quit working. Moving on to better products. Got some JBL's from Walmart and they stay put much better and sound better.

❤️ Update July 2020 ...  EXCEPTIONAL SOUND & CUSTOMER SERVICE!❤️


🌸Update July 12, 2020I was not paid or compensated in anyway for this review.I’m an ordinary customer.Updated review of Tekatron ...Senso Earbuds..Comfortable, durable, excellent customer service and SUPERB sound quality!Affordable too!I like the fact that they’re hard to lose because they have a nice wraparound that hangs around my neck. I’ve never lost a pair.I’m hard of hearing and these are great earbuds!These are comfortable, durable, and excellent value and they don’t break easy. The customer service is absolutely fantastic!I’ve been ordering Senso (Tekatron) earbuds and over the ear headphones or over 3 years.I own about 6 - 9 pair of their earbuds (different styles) and a pair of over the headphones  by Tekatron and I am very pleased!Noise canceling is excellent.This time I ordered the BLUE Senso Bloothtooth earbuds and I already know this will be a fantastic product.Please, please, please always remember to register your product so that you can get a discount code to apply to your next purchase.Tekatron is very accommodating!Customer service is exceptional. A lot of people seem to be confused between the blue, red and black.Some have a soft case and some have a hard case etc.Seriously… I have not found any difference in the GREAT sound quality and the customer service is superb!I don’t like to talk on the phone with these earbuds or any earbuds.I accidentally ended up on a phone call while I was listening to music on my phone.The person on the other end could not even tell I was using a pair of earbuds!The customer service we reach 24 hours and there’s always a friendly voice on the phone.Now I’m starting to colorcode them.The older style I had the over the ear and it was not conforming to the ear.(I think they discontinued those)At one point they stopped working. Tekatron Replaced them within days!These earbuds arrive with little earpieces to fit your ear and other little gadgets that make life a little less complicated.I think this will make my 9th pair.Someone may ask ...why do you need so many pair of earbuds? Answer: My neighbor had a new baby. (Make sense?) And I use the different colors to colorcode them.Older review and still working fantastic....Here is the Oder review...I’ve ordered this product Senso earbuds for several years.I refer my friends also to this product as I find these ear buds to be of exceptional quality.The customer service is absolutely wonderful and accommodating.I don’t think I’d want to order another brand after working with this company.I wouldn’t consider these earbuds completely waterproof but they’re excellent for exercising or just listening around town or your home.These have a nice range of about 30 feet.  The sound quality is superb with excellent noise canceling.Not real fancy but they absolutely are my favorite earbuds. I will order again and refer others to this product. Thank you Amazon.com :-) 🌸

... displeased with this purchase but I am a bit disappointed with the overall quality


I’m not displeased with this purchase but I am a bit disappointed with the overall quality. Based on more then one review I was expecting a high volume high quality bass with a HD Treble that some reviewers praised highly. That being the bar that was set, here is my take on these buds. Volume . . . What enthusiastic reviews purpose is not what I’m hearing. The volume on a iPhone 6 + is about the same as the earbuds you get with the iPhone, not an immersive experience of having the artist playing beside you but a good overall sound that is about par with buds at this price range. Max volume is clear but bass is at best average. No thumps, bumps or whumpfs to get the heart in sync but bass is noticeable. Treble is high quality but at full tilt can cut like a razor. I purchased these to replace a pair of lost Spigens I really enjoyed. In comparison to those, these are more comfortable and will be great for the high impact work I perform at my job as a green waste manager who is constantly in motion working with heavy equipment and lifting up to 80 lbs on a daily run. My job is hell on electronics and these buds fit and hold their weight. Just wish they played a little louder to drown out the grinding of leaf cutters and wood chippers, but then the last pair was equally challenged. 4 stars is a fair rating considering the price and there are several perks that come with it has far a packaging goes. Most notably the handy and well built carrying case. You get your moneys worth for listening enjoyment but not recommended for critical listening.

Good sound quality; Bluetooth only works within 10 ft


tl;dr: Great headset if you're never 10+ ft from your phoneI bought this pair so I could listen to music while skating (headphones and earbuds were falling out due to the strong centripetal forces from spinning). Unfortunately, the Bluetooth connection craps out if you're more than 10 ft from your broadcasting device (my iPhone). It just gets poppier and poppier until it completely disconnects, which means it's pretty much useless for what I wanted.In it's defense, this headset is at an excellent price point for the great sound quality and the noise cancelling (muffling) it provides. It's also very comfortable to wear, and the over ear wire is adjustable to mold to your ear. Throughout 3 hrs of very active skating, it never fell off, although the earbud did pop out of my ear once or twice. I third the people saying the red foam earbuds are the best; the other ones felt very hard and uncomfortable.

A nice little unit for the money!


These Bluetooth headphones are very nice for the money.  I’ve owned a pair for almost two years now and because of their performance I bought a pair for my wife.  I use mine when doing chores around the house listening to music from my iPhone.  They’re light weight and might seem very cheap but the switchgear are sturdy, have held up, and still feel as new.  They paired easily with both my iPhone and iPad.  I’m not much of an audiophile but the sound produced is just fine for me.  I know I’ve easily gotten 6 to 7 hours battery life a few times although I rarely have them on for more than 3 or 4.  I usually charge them immediately after I use them.  Battery life has not been an issue for me.  There was a time when the device had trouble pairing or staying connected.  Did some research and did a factory reset of some type (I don’t recall the procedure).  I have never had to reset it again.  Rarely use them for phone conversations but they worked fine the few times I have.  Been very happy with this purchase.  I’ve gotten a lot of satisfaction for very little money.

Great for Zoom


They don't have the highest quality sound for music, but I did used to wear them in the gym and they were adequate. Now I use them at my desk for Zoom meetings and they are perfect. Cuts out all the background noise in the office and the microphone works great too. During meetings I can turn my camera off, get up and go stretch a little, get a cup of tea in the kitchen, stand on the back steps of the building, all without losing the conversation. I've just bought a second pair for my daughter as mine are still going strong after 3 years!

Really?


The reality:  Out of the box these sound horrible. Tons of distorted midbass even if it isn't in the music. No low bass to speak of. The mids and highs are virtually non existent due to the horrible mid bass emphasis. There is not one thing about their sound that is accurate or natural. It sounds to me like they slapped in a driver and let it run full range with no thought whatsoever put into it's actual sound reproduction. For those that never owned an audio salon or that grew up with 4-15's in a box will probably be happy.The Good:  They are built on par with others costing much more. If build quality was the measure and not the actual ability to reproduce sound, they would rate up there with others. They include a pair of foam tips which for me, is the only option for any earbud and merits a star. They can be equalized to provide decent sound but it requires massive db changes which is the marker for a poorly designed product. I'd be embarrassed to make such an offering.Conclusion: I would never suggest these to anyone that has heard anything with  remotely decent audio reproduction. It is a total miss.

Sound quality is fine but connectivity comes and goes


Have bought two of these in about 30 months after my first one broke about 9 months ago.  Had some issues with the first one where it would require me to connect about 3-4 times to my ipad or iphone before the connection would work.  It would show the headphone and battery bar icon on my phone but when I played music the music would come out of my phone or ipad and not the headphones.  Occasionally I would even have to restart the apple product and reengage the bluetooth again to get it to work.  It was rare that it connected perfectly on the first try but 2 tries was most common.  The first set eventually broke when it wouldn't connect to my phone at all anymore.  It kept saying searching and my phone would not see it come up.  I tried the headphones on 4 different devices to make sure it wasn't the connecting device that was the problem, but it failed to connect on any so I threw it away.  I bought another pair because for $25, lasting nearly 2 years was good enough for me.  I would absolutely recommend these over wireless beats as I went through three pairs of wireless beats (2 for me and one for my wife) in 2 years.  For the ripoff price beats charges they had better last 5 years not just under 1 year.  Sound quality for these phones and beats were even to me and neither really do much noise cancellation at all, which is fine because I wouldn't expect much out of this type of design.  Of important note, my second pair of these headphones does not have any issues with bluetooth connectivity and I honestly don't think it has EVER failed to connect on the first try, so perhaps just got a bad pair for my first go round (or an unusually lucky pair this time!).  One issue I see with all three pairs (both of mine and the pair for my wife) is that they all fail to show the battery strength accurately on the phone.  The battery bar on the device starts at 100% and then goes down to 75% or 66% or so immediately on the icon on the phone, but never goes below that ever.  Thus I have had many a workout where my headphones died 15 minutes in to my 60 min workout which is very annoying!  For that, I try to keep rough track of my workouts and try and charge the headphones after each 3rd or 4th workout to be sure they don't die on me, but occasionally i still forget.  Have a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones (that are amazing!) that always tell me battery strength remaining when I turn them on and that notification is always accurate.  Wish these headphones did the same.

Good for hands free listening


I had purchased this as a result of the glowing reviews it received. I wanted a unit to be able to have hands free operation of my iPhone, I do not have much use of earphones.The good is, these are light and comfortable on and in the ear - possible because of the soft covering on the earpiece and the hook which keep the buds in place. The sound reproduction is very good for an earbud when wearing both, it blocks out outside noises not totally eliminate them so one is able to hear when one is called and/or warning sounds.With regards answering the telephone, the reason for my purchase - I am able to hear the caller well, which speaks to the quality of the sound. Many times I am told by the recipient, they are not able to hear me clearly. I therefore have to shout and/or cup my hand over my mouth in order to direct the sound to where I think the microphone is located - very inconvenient, when my coal was hands free. The wire that joins the two buds get tangled if I try to wear it at the back of my neck, so now I wear the wire in front or use only one (RIGHT which has the controls and keep the other in my pocket). Unfortunately the solution I use looks tacky so I only utilize it when I am alone.This is a good solution for hands free listening, I am not sure about being heard when using it to answer the telephone. Very comfortable, not stressful on the ears. I would recommend it for runners or people who want to listen to their own ""stuff"".

SHAZAM!!!!!


*********Legitimate Purchase...paid full price and non-promotional review********I have a friend who loves his Plantronics bluetooth earbuds which sell on Amazon for $82.00.  We go to the gym together and work out together and I was asking him about how he likes them as I was struggling with my own bluetooth earbuds that kept falling out of my ears or getting caught on my shirt collar.  As soon as I got home I started looking on Amazon for those and was about to purchase when I say these advertised as similar items.  Being less then half the price it was worth taking the few minutes to give them a look.  The style is similar but I pay a lot of attention to quality reviews and these were off the charts with 5 star ratings.  Shopping with Amazon Prime means if I buy something and think it sucks I can easily return for a no hassle money back, so I decided to give it a go.  And I'm very glad I did!  Simply WOW!!!  This is a no brainer purchase.  I HIGHLY recommend giving these a shot before you shell out $80 - $200 for bluetooth buds.  I can promise you won't be disappointed.  Sounds is about as good as you could expect from earbuds.  I've tried no less then 30 sets of earbuds over the past 5+ years and these are undeniably the best sounding for tone, range, and volume I've experienced.  The fit is also extremely comfortable.  The earloops are flexible silicon, not stiff like the rubber wrapped plastic hooks you'd expect, comes with 3 sizes of earbuds to fit your earhole, and a flexible, tangle free flat cable connecting left to right.  The right side unit houses the multi-function button, volume +/- buttons, charging port and LED indicator.  These are are waterproof with soft rubber/silicon closing over charging port.The package comes with the earbuds, a short 12"" mini USB cable, a 3' long flat lighting cable that has a dual mini USB and iPhone charging tip, car charger adapter with two ports and LED backlit, and rigid zippered carry case.  You'll also find a card to register for your free 1 year warranty (takes about 15 seconds to register and ask for email, password, and Amazon Order # and 10% off coupon for a future purchase, which actually came to be a 15% coupon.Everything about this purchase points to quality, from the packaging to the presentation to the delivery (ended up being next day even though I didn't pay for expedited shipping).  I paid $35.97 with Amazon Prime

Good starter set of BT headphones


Bought after getting tired of clotheslining myself with my normal corded headphones.Had to adjust the earbud size after first day; they do come with different earbud sizes and I'm glad they do, as the ones that came with were extraordinarily uncomfortable.Sound is good. The little wrap-around wire that holds the bud into your ear isn't the best. While I appreciate that you can change it's shape, when you're doing high-impact stuff they do tend to lose some grip and have to be readjusted.Honestly, my biggest complaint is that the ""handsfree"" controls are a bit non-intuitive: the + button is back, and the - button is in front. So it was an adjustment to want to change the volume or change a song...and then realize that the button that is most forward on the controls is actually the ""back a song"" or ""decrease volume"" control. Of all the quirks o this product, this is genuinely the one that I have the biggest quibble with. Even than, they're not bad. Certainly not bad for the price. I'd recommend tailoring your expectations accordingly, but def try them out.

Bought this headphone a second time and the quality of this product is degraded and got worst.


I bought this headphone for a second time since I have lost my first one recently.  The quality of this product is degraded comparing to the first one.  The very short charging cable came with the box has a wrong connector type but luckily I still have to first charging cable so it not an issue but it would be for you if you did not have the correct charging cable.  The blue LED light on the headphone to indicate the full charged battery is not working.  The LED turn from Red (charging) to no light indicator.  Luckily I have sync the headphone to my phone so I can see the headphone battery full on my phone.  I will try a different product the next time.

Worked when it did, but so Many Problems.


TL;DR Just OK, stopped working after a month or so.So when I got these, I was very excited because product reviews were great, it was Amazon’s Choice and all. It came in a nice package with many different things that really made it seemed worth the price. HOWEVER.I bought these Feb. 25, 2018 and it is now April. 17, 2018 and they have stopped working.I only used them for the Gym which was every other day. Within the time it was working, it would occasionally get static and disconnect itself. The volume buttons took a lot more pressure to work than when it first came in. And in the middle of a workout, it just shut itself off and stopped working. No indication of low battery. The red light didn’t turn on while charging so I charged for 30 minutes like the manual said, but it is still broken.Side note, the charger that came with it. One side of the Lightning Cable stopped working shortly after purchasing it.I essentially paid $20+ for a micro usb and half a lightning cable. Very disappointed.

Nice headphones, great value. Noise canceling effect got me in trouble though.


When I first received these headphones I had an issue with the sound quality. I wrote the distributor and they immediately got back in touch with me to resolve the issue. Apparently there was an issue with the calibration and the distributor walked me through on how to re-calibrate the headphones. After that was done, the music sounded much better / no complaints. The connectivity is great and the battery lasts a long time. The fit is comfy and when the large loop allows you to remove the bud from your ears and let the buds dangle from your ear so you can have a conversation with someone or just have them out temporarily to hear around you. You can also just have the cord around your neck and just let the buds dangle around your neck. The buds fit snug inside the ear and have a noise canceling effect. I’ll often have the buds in my ear with music at a low volume and my wife will come up from behind and start talking and I don’t hear her. She thinks I am just ignoring her but it’s actually I really can’t hear her from the snug fit of the ear bud. For the $, this is a great pair of headphones. Would recommend to a friend to buy, just don’t get in trouble with your significant other.

NOT Noise Cancellation (false advertising) - Otherwise works well - Good for the price


Let me start with the ""Cons"" because I'm offended by advertising for this product (I still gave it 4 stars)Cons: - No they are NOT Noise Cancelling.  False advertisement on the part of the manufacturer.  The box it came in shows ""CVC 6.0 Noise Cancellation"" on the front, but there is no noise cancellation at all (this is called lying!).  If you do a search on ""cvc 6.0 noise cancellation"" you will see reference to both the CVC/Qualcomm technology and another link about CVC 6.0 noise cancellation being Active Noise Cancellation. - Their passive noise cancellation is non existent.  Just a marketing ploy.  I have a pair of ""Passive Noise Cancellation"" headphone which do a good job of blocking noise, but these do ZERO for blocking noisePros: - Light & comfortable on my ears. - Good Microphone.  Called my brother and a friend to get their opinion on the mic sound, both felt it was as clear as the iPhone mic (I switched back and forth) - The buttons are well placed and work easily. - Sound is good, not great. - All of the accessories are good.  Glad to have everything I need with this product (have not tried the car charger yet) - Price is reasonable for what you get (build seems good so far - just 2 days of using it). - The support service was good.  I spoke to Senso (very polite gentlemen) about the noise cancellation and about my gripe that they were doing some false advertising. He can't do much about it of course, but I was impressed that someone answered on a Saturday morning.  This might be enough reason for me giving them a 4 star.

Bought 4 years ago


I like these headphones, they sound good, battery life is good, I would buy again, but the manufacturer needs to change to a more resilient wire between the two ear pieces. I have had the outer layer of insulation break open and expose the inner wires, now in four paces. I'm able electro-mechanically, so have installed heatshrink tubing over the cracked part, all was fine until a year or 18 months later the insulation cracked again at new positions. So I fixed that again. Good headphones but expect the outer insulation to go bad.

Best value headphones for sport, period.


Just got my headphones yesterday. They came with a charge so I could try them out right away. How cool and thoughtful is that! The package is impressive. Everything you need plus more is included. The case is great. Hard shell yet soft to the touch. Stylish as well. Has a net pocket inside.You can easily tell someone(s) asked themselves, ""how can I make this product an even better value to beat the competition?"".A brief history of my headphones from Amazon; These headphones are replacements for the Senbowe bluetooth headphones I bought here in 2015. The Senbowe still work but they fall out of my ear and the cord on the back is tacky and snags my skin which pulls the plugs out of my ear when I turn my head (big design flaw). They are also not very loud. Otherwise they work very similar to these. The Senso is also replacing another pair I tried about 6 months ago which I feel are total garbage: Beyution V4.1 Bluetooth headphones. Those are 'on the ear' style and were cheap plastic garbage which broke. Seller offered to replace them but I didnt want another pair.So with that said, these headphones are made well. They are slightly large looking in my ears but not so goofy that I look like a robot. It's not an issue. The cord on the back of my neck does not snag on my skin and is not tacky. 2 cord clips are included as a bonus. They just keep things tidy and pick up the slack. Nice touch! The headphones are super light and the around ear part is very comfy. Love it. I have large ears and the default plugs worked great for me but they come with other sizes as well included. The box includes a couple USB cords and a card charging port (how thoughtful and great!).The sound I feel is only slightly bass heavy but I need more time to determine how I like that. It sounded great when I tried them for 5 minutes.I was very impressed by how loud they are! I was also very impressed with the outside sound suppression. I listened to music near my AC window unit and I couldn't hear it! It was on high. This is getting close to my higher end Bose 25 headphones with active noise reduction (requires a battery for those headphones). Super impressive! That was a big surprise. I honestly didn't think it would be as good as it is. I use headphones in the gym and I don't want to listen to the loud pop music they play at all.The controls work fine. I haven't tried the phone feature yet. Hooking up to a wireless Bluetooth connection was breeze. The instructions included are simple and easy to follow. The case also included a pamphlet on how to get support which I hear is excellent but hope to never use.Bottom line. Best value headphone set/package I have every found and at a price point which is great! Win/Win. Rock on!

They were good while they lasted...which wasn't long


I originally purchased these headphones in April of 2017.  They were around $37 at the time.  Also purchased the Assurant Warranty that Amazon asked about (about $6 for 3 years of coverage).  The headphones worked great for many months.  I sweat a lot and they withstood the copious amount of sweat I generate.  The sound and volume controls were good as well.  (Not great, but heck, I am running in them, not using them to listen to music in the office.)One day in March of 2018 while I was out for a run the headphones just turned off.  I thought it might have been the battery that went out, so I tried charging them.  Nothing.  I contacted Senso support and they sent out a replacement pair under their 1 year manufacturer warranty.  I received the replacements in early April of 2018.Fast forward to June of 2018 and after charging the headphones, I go to use them.  They don't turn on.  I think that maybe the battery didn't charge, so I stick them back on and notice the little red indicator light doesn't come on.  I keep it plugged in and try to reset the headphones.  Again, nothing happens.While the first set of headphones lasted a long time, given the price, I am just disappointed the second set died so quickly.  (Not even 2 months since I received them.)  I wanted to give more stars to this product, but I just can't given that I have two dead pairs in under 14 months.  At least I can make a warranty claim, but I don't have high expectations for the replacements.

Made it unscathed thru a wash/dry cycle!


I've been using these headphones for about 18 months on and off, and regularly for the past 3 months, mostly while working out. I've got to say, for the price these are very well made. At one point about a month ago, I forgot I had them in the pocket of my hoodie, which I threw in the wash. I thought I had lost them and looked for them for an entire day. My wife found them while she was folding the laundry the next day, just as I was considering ordering another set. I really did not expect them to work anymore, but they fired right up and sounded as good as they did the first day I got them. I was pretty astonished that it made it thru a super wash cycle, then a dryer cycle, coming out unscathed. It's been a month, and they are still working perfectly fine. They certainly are not for audiophiles or those that want truly stellar sound, especially not at this price point. They're for casual listening.As far as negatives, the wire that connects the 2 sides is too rubbery, which causes it to keep catching on dry skin, clothing, etc. If the connecting wire was made a bit slicker, this issue would probably go away. Not a huge deal though, all the positives outweigh the small negatives. The other negative is that the microphone is practically useless at this point, as the person on the other end of the line can't hear me speak when the earbud is in my ear. I have to bring the mic side of the earbud closer to my mouth so they can hear. However, I don't know if this is because of the wash/dry cycle, as I had not really used it for the calling functionality until after that happened.

Playback issues, among other things


I finally decided to try the cord free life, and this was my first stop on the journey.Pros:-Comes with nice case and a bunch of different size earbuds-Also includes magnetic adapters for all kinds of things-Pairing is very easy-Controls work well, even with two features using the same buttons (volume and track skip are the same buttons either pressed or held)Cons:-Had what I can only describe as syncing issues. The audio would sometimes cut to silence, and then suddenly play back the missing few seconds at super speed to catch up to the phone. I have plenty of other bluetooth speakers that my phone and apps pair with flawlessly, so I can only conclude it's an issue with the headphones. Seems to be once every 2-5 minutes while listening.-This is something I never thought to look out for, but the control boxes are so boxy that you can hear even a slight breeze whipping around them. It's loud enough to make it hard to hear the sound coming from the headphones! Seriously, I don't know what's up with that.-My ears are really small and a not properly shaped, so getting the headphones to sit properly and comfortably was an issue.After a few days of trying to acclimate to this pair of headphones I have to give up. I will be returning these to try a different style

As solid as you'd expect


If you're looking for military grade reliability and/or amazing sound quality this probably isn't the headphone for you.  Having said that these are the only headphones that I have used that have lasted through many a sweaty run....Some things to note:- tl;dr Don't ever use a fast charger it'll basically brick your device.- DO NOT~ Under Any circumstances charge it with a fast cahrger (like a samsung phone charger or anything with fast charge or quick charge or whatever branding they apply to higher amperage charging) It will make it freak the f out.  the headphones will charge but they will overcharge which you would not think is a thing but it is... so what happens is you charge them with a fast charger and you aren't able to turn them on for a little bit until the batteries fall to a certain level..... it will basically seems like they're dead.  The light will light up purple.  (don't panic.... if you're in this situation just wait like a day or so and they'll turn back on.)- When it says low battery, you have about 10 minutes.  Probably less...... usually less.- the cord between the headphones will flap around...  I do not know what it is made out of but it will stick to everything sweaty and yank the headohones out of your ear if it hits a spot on your head with the right amount of friction.Overall though I enjoy these headphones.  They are great.

Love them!


I've gone through 4 pairs of earbuds that supposedly were guaranteed not to fall out of your ears. They all did. I finally decided to try these just because they are so inexpensive in comparison.I'm so glad I did. I've done several runs in these, the longest being 13 miles. They never once fell out or even felt loose. They are comfortable enough that I didn't feel the need to adjust them at any point.I think the sound quality is great. I have a galaxy s8 and didn't need to adjust anything on the sound settings. I had them down relatively low. I can't imagine ever listening to them at full volume.The controls are very easy to use (pause, play, ff, rewind, answer and hang up calls). I had no problem pairing them and they immediately connect as soon as I turn them on.As for battery life, I've never tested them beyond probably about 3 hours, but had no problem with that.The box comes with several different size ear buds, a wire holder, a dual car charger, a USB port with both micro USB and lightning connectors, and a carry case. I love the case because it's small enough to easily pack away but keeps them protected.I'll update this review if I find anything to complain about, but so far, I really love these and highly recommend them.

Disappointed


I really wanted these to be the answer to all my previous earphones that failed in one way or another—but nope, I guess nothing’s perfect.I sweat profusely when I run and I bought these not only bc I wanted sweatproof earphones, but earphones that stayed in my ears while running. They stayed put for the most part (the space between the hook that goes over the ear and the actual earbud is too large so the hook really serves no purpose).As far as the waterproof part goes, its not. I mean unless sweatproof and waterproof are completely different things in this context. The first time I used these (2 days ago), they stopped working after about 50 minutes of running and I wasn’t even done running. The earphones were fully charged right before I ran too. They didn’t respond to any of my button pushing. So my assumption was that it stopped working bc of all the sweat that dripped all over them. Once they were dry, they worked again.So either I got bad earphones or they just don’t perform for those who sweat hella. I think I’m just gonna go back to the basic earbuds. Those work with sweat.

Good product overall, decent price


I have had these ear buds for about a month or so. I use it mainly when working out and when traveling. So far, I am pretty satisfied with the quality. They've held up pretty well, I keep mine in the case when not in use, and the battery life has been good as well. The sound quality is good, given these are nothing like the more fancier brands like Beats or Bose, etc. so don't expect the crisp sounds or bass boosts if that's what you're looking for. Sound quality is clear and can get loud, but remember, you can always adjust your equalizer on your cell phone or whatever device you are pairing it with. However, I am overall pleased with the quality and price point.

They're great. They do the job well


Affordable and functional. Good bass response. Fits kind of weird over the ear but adjustable (unless I'm using them wrong. The arm doesn't hang over the ear from the back, it does from the front. Strange, but it works and is fairly comfortable).I accidentally left them on overnight and they were still on in the morning indicating a long battery life. However, I wish they had auto shutoff if they go for several minutes without audio).Happy with the purchase. I haven't used them as a phone headset so I cannot comment on microphone pickup or quality. I imagine they will be okay, but can't say.As for noise cancellation... not sure if they mean because you can use them to plug up the ear canal or if they actually produce frequencies that cancel outside noises. I'm going to guess because you can use them as earplugs. Either way, didn't buy them to cancel out outside noise and I don't know if that works or not.Happy with purchase. Glad I bought 'em. :)

I got it for cycling adventures and I just got another one


I have various earbuds (cheap ones and more costly high quality pairs) as I often wear a hat. In this case I wanted something light, comfortable and with noise cancelation/isolation that would stay on my ears for when I ride my bike for miles and miles. I was a little skeptical at first because the ear piece looked bulky - that helps to keep it stable. The buds jut out from the rectangular body. Power on/off, volume and skip/rewind controls are easy. It remembers the last bluetooth device I connected to so I don't need to pair every time unless I want to switch to a different device. It blocks most of outside noise. I found myself using it more often for other situations, like commuting and traveling, and taking conference calls. Since sometimes I have too many calls in a day, I decided to get another one so I can alternate while the other one charges (which doesn't take too long). It takes some getting used to finding the right position at first (ear shapes vary of course and there's no one size fits all), but I got used to it. Sound quality of course doesn't compared to high quality earbuds, but for the price it's pretty good. You get a lot of bang for your buck on this.

Really comfortable headphones


I needed Bluetooth headphones that were comfortable and ideal for working out in. The ones I have had in the past, although very good, were very uncomfortable behind my ears and I couldn't workout in them because they would fall off.  I had also changed jobs where I no longer had my own office but was now in a cubicle on an open floor.  So most importantly I needed noise reduction, not cancellation because I still need to hear if my phone rings or someone calls my name.  These so far have checked all of my boxes. The quality is really good! Not to mention the battery life. I rarely have to charge this. My only issue is that it can only pair with one device at a time.  My other Bluetooth headset can pair with two devices. I have two phones, one personal and one for work so it's a bit inconvenient sometimes that I have to switch it from device to device.  That's the only reason so far that I didn't given it all 5 stars. I have and would recommend it to others.Update: I am disappointed to report that these headphones just stopped charging one day. There is no explanation for it as I put it to charge the same way I always have. So I guess it's not a long term investment. But while it worked it worked very well so I would not change my rating.

Far better than expected


For a long while I scorned Bluetooth earbuds because they were bulky and sort of ugly. A lot has changed in a few years and these are proof that the technology is getting much better.The sound quality is great for earbuds of this price range. I was especially impressed by the crisp mid range tones. Low range isn't spectacular but you'd have to pay a lot more for that.They're very light and hold a charge for about the advertised 8 hours of continuous use. Plenty of accessories to customize the fit, and a nice charger with a carrying case. My only real complaint is that the charging port cover is a soft rubber material that sits flush with hard plastic, making it difficult to remove with my fingernails.***Update April 25, 2018:My earbuds seem to have kicked the bucket. They suddenly stopped pairing with any of my music devices, even after a reset across multiple devices and the earbuds themselves. This is within the advertised one year warranty, but I have no idea how to redeem it or who to contact. They have a scant website with a product registration email, so I will see if it actually works or not.

The sound alone is nice, my highs and lows are good. Update: product failed within 4 months normal use.


Updated 5/29, with maybe 60 workouts, battery life shorted out, power button unresponsive/died within days. Called manufacturer after trying other charges, asked for new replacement updated model..sound quality a little better with more field and mids but bass is muffled with suggested red earpieces..dont know but the quality seems more refined and balanced mainly. 3 stars.I am quite convinced these standup to sweat and use, charge fairly quick because I dont use them for 5 hours at a time when I recharge (HOWEVER, this was still a crucial factor for buying that they COULD, when desired, when comparing options). The fact that these respond so well in charging, against sweat, use, bluetooth reception (depends on atmospheric interference too) and sound and fit in my ear so well I leave the review at a 4. Would come back in months to give a 5 if they can hold up, or if these guys honor warranties if something seems to go downhill.The sound alone is nice, my highs and lows are good, midrange is good (also depends on phone/streaming service). GOOD!This was a quality buy with other potential product options on the market. Now knowing what I know, those would ALL be a risk in comparison.May senso prosper at this price point/warranty honoring if needed.

Great, inexpensive Beats alternative


So I have had these for about two weeks now. So a few take aways from my experience with these.Positive:1.  Great Sound.  Even though I have not actually owned the Beats Wireless Ear Buds (Power Beats3 are the best comparison), I had the chance to check them out for a few minutes a few days prior to receiving these.  I loved the tone the Beats produced.  Nice blend of lows and highs along with mids.  When I received the Senso Earphones, I was blown away at how well they sounded in comparison (maybe not quite as good as the Power Beats which I tried along with my phone with the same music as the Senso pair but much better than what you would think for a set that costs less than 1/6th the cost).2.  Ease of use.  These are pretty easy to use.  All the controls are on the right side ear bud.  You have the main multi-purpose button along with the volume up/down button (double as the skip forward/backward buttons).  On the bottom side of the same unit is the connector for the charger (under a small rubber cover which can be somewhat problematic to handle; more on that below).  The multi-purpose button is used for pausing/playing music (by just pushing the button once and immediately releasing) and bringing up calling or voice control (depending on your phone; since I use a Galaxy S7 Edge, it pulls up the Google voice control which is nice) by pressing and holding the button for about a second or so.3. Comfort.  I have smaller ears, so the small ear buds work well for me (even though I could use the medium size though they got uncomfortable after a while).  I do use these more as a bluetooth ear piece than full on ear buds because of the amount I tend to drive but I do like to have them as a full headset when I want to listen to music while I work alone at times.4.  These are very much water resistant.  Because I work outside in the rain, I wanted something that would hold up to some water (though I wear rain gear).  I do get quite damp, especially when the rain is heavy.  I have not even noticed these being affected by water.5.  The range.  This is something I really cannot testify to other than an experience this evening.  I started playing music while I was doing laundry.  I went out to our washing machine which is on the same side of the house as my room but divided by a wall.  I had not realized I left my phone on my desk in my room until I made couple of moves that made my music break up a little.  But in all, it kept going with really not a lot of breaking up.  A nice surprise.Negatives:1. Lack of battery level until battery is low.  I have yet to find a way to know what the battery level is at whenever I want.  The only time it notifies me of the level is when the battery level is low.  This can be annoying on so many levels.  First and foremost is that I am usually away from a charger for long periods at a time.  So when the battery notifies me that it is low, I just have to turn it off (because every few minutes or so it will chime in that the battery is low being rather annoying).  My previous bluetooth headset would notify me each time I powered them on as to what level they were at (high, medium or low).2.  The multi-purpose button, though blended in to make both sides look uniform, tends to blend in too well.  Because the ear bud is in my ear, I have to find the button by feeling around.  I have found myself on multiple occasions missing the button trying to push the area forward of the button.  I have also found myself pressing the button once to bring up voice control and accidentally starting my music (but this is more out of habit because my previous headset had more buttons including separate buttons for play/pause and voice control vs the same button for both).3. Because I do use this as a bluetooth headset for driving, leaving just the right earbud in and the left out creates a situation in which the left side will weight down on the right side.  As a result I have to put the left side within my collar on my shirt to leave slack in the wire (but this is really because these were really meant to be used as a full headset).4.  Music can cut in and out if you just started playing right after turning on the headset.  But to solve this problem, just wait several seconds (maybe 15-30 seconds) after the headset connects before starting to play music.  Then it works like a charm.So far, I cannot say much about the battery life as I do tend to use these differently than my last headset (LG Tone Pro which tended to last me about two weeks between charges).  I have found that I am charging these about once a week, maybe a little longer.  But I am using these for more music through the day not to mention I have them on a good chunk of the day as I need hands free while working to receive and make calls as needed.Overall, I have been pleased with these.  When I was forced to find a new headset (my previous headset broke off at the right arm), I was looking for something that had sound similar to that of the Beats but at a fraction of the price.  These fit the bill well.  I totally recommend these, especially if you do not want to spend the $200 for the pricier Beats.

Not overly durable but worked well at first.


Decent fit (use the correct ear piece for your ear). Stay on well because of the loop. Some issues with the quality breaking up even when my phone was only on my waist line but it was not frequent though frustrating. Biggest two issues I had are the they start warning you verbally that the battery is low at 30%, so every minute or so it goes ""Battery Low"" while you are wearing them. This means they can only be for 70% of their battery capacity with out this annoyance. The other issue is that my left ear has gone out and the while the wire is still solidly connected, it is clearly a wire issue because it comes and goes when you wiggle the wire but since I use these when I run the wire wiggles while using them. Too bad. I need a new pair now, because of the wire issue, but will probably find something else that is hopefully more durable. I bought these last March, used them everyday until December and then only a few times a week since then because I could only put up with the lack of a left ear piece for shorter periods.

Decent set of headphones for the price


The fit is really good and pairing with a phone or tablet is very easy. The sound is decent enough, not to ""tinny"" nor to ""bassy"". Customer service is great, so if you have any questions or concerns just reach out to them, they are quick to respond! Not really noise canceling (at least not on the level of my other headphones!) but once you adjust the fit most ambient sounds are muffled. Again, for the cost, these are a decent set of headphones.

Love them!


Love these! These are my third pair. I use these 5 days week and take a shower with them on afterwards. They have improved the quality and the addition of adjustable “ear straps” is nice since my first pair. Their customer service is ASTOUNDING! After 3 months, my first pair went bad and they immediately replaced them without me asking. They just read my review. That second pair lasted for over a year. You may think, “only a Year?!” But I wear them 4-5 times a week for an two hours in sun, rain and snow. I only wear one bud while biking so the other dangles under my shirt so it is bound to break from the extra pull. My third pair suddenly stopped working and I emailed them about the issue. Within a day they answered back with a diagnosis and fix. Perfect! My only problem it sometimes can skip once in a while while I shower. I wonder if it is something to do with moisture sneaking in. I mean, really they weren’t built to take a shower with.

Great value for price.


Fast delivery.  Quick and easy pairing.Comfort: flexible rings that sit outside the ear.  The inserts inside the ear are not flexible and are a bit uncomfortable.Sound: listening to podcasts, music, or audiobooks have clear and decent sound levels.  Phone calls are also clear talking or listening.Volume control: seems hit or miss.  It’s worked once.  And not since then.  Will recheck instructions but don’t see how up or down can be this complicated.  I can turn up or down volume on phone for volume preferences but without ability to control via earpiece is frustrating.Battery life: I’ll include recharge cords.  Two are included plus adapter for car. With all the options have yet to run out of battery power.  Longest continuous use 4.5 hours.  And while I can’t see a level of power it was still playin fine.Compact carrier: I bought this version instead of the newer one because of the carrier.  And I do like it.  A firm carrier with space for cords and the earbuds.  Zippers close.  Safely tumbles in my purse or backpack with no problems.Overall- this is a great value for the price.  I’ve had it less than 2 weeks and it does what I need for the most part and it was a great price.  A friend had this version and recommended.  I’ve since recommended it to others.

With a little upgrade -> a great sound


I have been using it for the last three months extensively and must admit that it has been a pleasant surprise.Pros:1. sound quality - that's the number one reason I would buy it. The bass is deep (although required a chance to achieve it, see below) the mids are nice, and the highs are clear.2. Quick charging and decent playback time3. Consistent connect and disconnect to multiple devicesCons:1. initially I noticed that the bass was not punchy enough, unlike what I read in the review, and that sound was leaking. One I changed the tips (I had to buy Comply Foam tips separately) the sound was WAYYY better, the fit was good and no movement in and out.2. Bluetooth connection - sometimes patchy, especially when placing the phone in the left back pocket. I do not have this issue with other similar types of earbuds (Bose and Beats)3. Comfort - after a lengthy use (I fly long hauls, a lot) the arched part is a bit rough on the ears, I wish it were smoother and less rigid.I guess that unless the sound was surprisingly nice, not just for this price, I would have given it fewer stars.

Battery drains FAST


When I first got these, I was so excited.  I hated the corded ear buds I've had in the past when at the gym.  These wireless buds worked, sounded fine, but the battery drains WAY too quickly!  After every use, even if only for a half hour, I have to recharge it or the next time I go to use them, the battery will be drained.  Recently, I had charged them up to full, popped them in my purse, and went on a train.  About an hour into my ride, I pulled them out to listen to a podcast.  And they had NO battery life.If the battery would hold a charge longer, if I didn't have to charge them every single time I use them, then I would most certainly have given them a higher rating.  I never had issues with sound cutting out or connectivity.  They worked fine for that and the sound, while not high quality, certainly wasn't terrible.  But the battery issue - that's a deal breaker for me.

Great customer service, TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!


First pair did not work properly and was sent a replacement pair.  They took well over a week to arrive.  I'm having the same problem with the replacement pair.  I used each about 10 times without any problem.  They connected quickly and didn't loose connection during exercise.  I was able to recharge them easily.  Then I had the following experience with each.  I plugged them in to charge after hearing the low battery message.  The blue light seemed to come on fairly quickly given my past experiences recharging.  Then when I unplug to use again, nothing.  no lights, no connection, just dead.  If you plug it back into the charger you see a steady blue light, but if you take it off nothing.These are not worth even the advertised discounted price.  Certainly were never worth the origianl price of almost $170.  If I had paid that much I'd be going crazy.  As it is, its a wasted $40.  I now have two pairs that are totally useless.  Very low quality product.

Better cheap Brands out there than this one.


I had a friend swear by these and state how great they are, but I found better brands and products that preform far better than this one. The sound quality is fine and the overall build quality isn't bad, but the piece that goes over the ear is super flimsy and cheap. The worst part is the microphone; you are literally unidentifiable by anyone on the other end of a phone call. I even listened to myself in a voice message and holy cow, sounds like I was talking through the lowest quality 1920's radio.If you're just looking for attached, bluetooth headphones for music these will get the job done, but honestly there are far better brands out there for the same price or $5 more!

I've bought these 3 times. 3 strikes and you're out.


They're cheap, battery life is great, bluetooth connection is fine. Sound quality isn't something I care about much when I'm running/exercising, so it's not really relevant. It's fine.The reason I keep buying them is that they keep dying. These are not effectively waterproof and I believe sweat has ruined the charging on all three sets. They last a few months, then the charging connection gets sporadic and has to be in just the right position, and then they stop charging entirely. I tend to limp them along for about 12 months, but it's annoying and I'm not doing that with my 3rd pair. I'm ordering something else so I don't have to wonder if my headphones will be charged in the morning or not.When they work they're fine. They just need to seal the charging port better and they would stop dying. Then again, if they did that right they'd have only gotten 30$ off me for my first set instead of 70$ for buying 3.I know I'm basically buying the cheapest thing I can find, but the charging situation is obnoxious. There's no way these can be submerged for 10 seconds much less 30 minutes when I know my sweat is corroding the charging port after 3 months.

Quality overall has gone down since first pair.


I bought a pair of these about four years ago, used them weekly if not daily. Very water resident, battery life was amazing, sound was awesome; plenty of bass and treble. Range was great, connection, atmospheric noise reduction was great. All of a sudden they were gone. Don’t know what happened to them, must have set them down at the gym or dropped out my bag, I don’t know. Ordered another pair because I had such a good experience with the first pair. Quality in hand was greatly inferior. Just felt like cheap plastic. Not nearly as much bass and max volume was less. Battery life seemed to be lacking. Then, all of a sudden, the charger port came lose in the earpiece and couldn’t be charged anymore. So, ordered another pair thinking maybe I just got a fluke crap pair. New pair is here. Feels about the same as broken pair, sound is the same, seems to stop charging before it’s done charging, reception/connection to device is garbage. I lose connection to my phone while it’s in my pocket when I used to be able to basically mow my lawn while my phone was in the house.

Awesome build and sound quality at a good price.


This is actually my second pair. I bought my first ones four years ago, and they have been great. The ear stem broke in my luggage somehow so I needed a replacement. No questions asked, I went right back to the Senso earbuds and ordered another pair. They come with different sized ""buds"" for fitting to the inside of your ear more appropriately. Bluetooth connection is strong. Buttons are well placed. Microphone picks up nice and clear.The only qualm I have may not have to do with these earbuds themselves, but sometimes when I don't have these connected to my phone I hear my phone ring and answer it only to realize I can't hear anything. After hanging up I try calling back but can't hear anything. Low an behold, somehow these earbuds have turned on and connected to my phone! So I was getting sound all along through the earbuds in my pocket and therefore couldn't hear anything through the headset itself. How did the earbuds get turned on? Was it automatically, or was the button pressed just right in my pocket?

Great headphone, don't get tricked into buying the ""brand name"" head phone.


I needed a cheap BT headphone for when I am out cycling. I didn't want to spend too much on a unit because I always end up loosing my headphone. This is why I don't like to bring my $100 headphone on the ride.I had this for about a week now and I am surprised at how great it sound.  The sound quality was very good and clear. I am a bass junky and have specialty headphone that is designed to bump. This is not a bass heavy headphone but well balanced.The fitment was really good as well. The default one didn't fit too well but it came with a bunch of other fitment that worked well for my ear. The trick to get the best sound quality is that you need to find one that fits snugly in your ear so you won't get any air leaks.The battery life on this headphone is really good as well. I've had it for about a week and I haven't had to recharge it yet.The built quality seems pretty solid as well. It is hard to say how long it will last but this looks just as well made as my other headphones that are 2-3 times the price.Overall, I am very happy with this headphone. For the price it rivals something 2-3 times the cost in terms of the sound quality.

Solid, good cost wireless earbuds.


I haven't had them long, but...The Good:1. Pairing was spotless—super quick and easy with an iPhone 7.2. Battery life was great; I used them for a long work-out (about 90 minutes) and then didn't shut them off. When I woke up the next morning, they were still paired with my phone, and still worked fine. Obviously, if you walk around all day listening to music, it's going to be an issue, but for the ""let's go for a run"" and occasional use, it's going to be fine.3. Controls are easy to understand; I haven't read the manual, and managed to figure it out. It has the right amount of ""obviousness.""4. There was no issue with the slipping out, and they're comfortable.Also, I need to make a point exceptionally clear—they come with the most awesome charging cable. On one end it's a standard USB, but the other end contains a clever connection that allows it to work with an iPhone Lightning cable or with a standard micro-usb. It's among the best part of the product—it's now my favorite cable.The ""meh""1. They're ""in the ear-canal"" style, which blocks sound and adds to the bass. That's a good thing, although if you're used to ear-buds that just rest in your ears, there's definitely a weirdness to outside sound and you can hear your blood pound when you're running.They're solid, and done well.

Don't bother, keep looking!


Although I always read a lot of reviews before purchasing a product, I don't typically write them. However, beyond frustrated with these things, I'm finally going to voice my opinion.First and foremost, the bluetooth connection is terrible especially outside. The sound cuts in & out every time there is a gust of wind. The same is true if I'm wearing my phone to the side or the back of my body, or if I bend at the waist. As my primary use for them is working in the yard, they're almost useless. Crouching over to garden... forget it!Secondly, every time I move my head the cord drags on my neck unseating the earbud a little at time so that every 5 minutes I'm readjusting them back in my ears.Basically the only time I have no issues with these earbuds is when I'm in the house doing very little and the phone is worn in front of my body. Then the sound is decent enough for the money. But this clearly isn't enough to recommend the product.

A great value and excellent customer service. Well worth the purchase price. **edited twice!*


For the money, I don't think you can beat these headphones. The sound is decent. Not super rich, but better than I expected it to be. They are light which helps them stay in pretty well. The ear loop is flexible actually kind of floppy which is a little annoying, but at the same time makes them comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They don't skip very much which is a huge plus for Bluetooth headphones. Mine stopped working after about a month of daily use. I emailed Senso and they got right back to me (on a Sunday no less). After trying to trouble shoot the headphones they sent me a new pair. Excellent customer service.*9/20/17I upgraded this review to five stars. I think Senso / Invotek have made me lifelong customers. They replaced my earbuds above and now about nine months later they replaced them again without any trouble. I know a company following through on their warranty shouldn't be a reason for excitement, but I think we all know it is. It's so rare these days to find a company that doesn't find a way to worm their way out of it. especially after they've honored it once already. I emailed them and received replacements literally two days later. The replacement earbuds have a firm ear loop which I think is an improvement. If they fixed the low battery warning, I'll be the creepy guy in the gym because I'll be crying tears of joy.

Decent bluetooth headphones


I spent hours, days almost, researching the perfect headphones for my workouts. I took a risk and tried the SENSO product. So far after 3 weeks, they have good sound, keep a charge throughout my workout sessions which typically last about 1.5 - 2 hours, and after some adjustments, stay in my ears.I know I have weird ears, so I played around with the additional earpieces to find the ones that fit best. There was a combination in the kit that worked, so I'm sticking with it. I don't worry much about the comfort--not that they are uncomfortable, but I'm generally lifting heavy things and they don't annoy me. When running on the treadmill, I do have to readjust them once in a while, but again, I have weird ears. They are definitely sweat proof, which is great. They come with a handy carrying case, IPhone charger, multiple ear pieces, and some other stuff which was nice. The additional ear pieces were major important but the other stuff wasn't a huge selling point.I had some pairing problems the second time I used it where I had to have my phone ""forget"" the device and try again. After that, I've had no other pairing problems. I love the fact that the controls are in the earpiece instead of in a dangly box that pulls the headphones to the right. One wire right around the back of my head = no problems.I am satisfied and glad I purchased these headphones.

These sound worse than headphones you get for free


I've tried a number of wired headphones before and I decided to give these headphones a try because I needed something for the gym and wired headphones kept getting in the way of activities. Knowing that the product had 10k reviews with 4.5/5 stars, I thought I was getting the wireless headphones for the money.But, when I turned it on, connected to Bluetooth and started playing music from Spotify and immediately noticed that the sound is REALLY low quality and it sounded washed out. I'm like, What? These I spent $40 on headphones and they sound this bad, It can't be...So then I tried bumping up the streaming quality from Normal to Extreme quality on Spotify and the audio still sounded washed out. I tried changing phones, to see if it was my phone's (Nexus 6p) Bluetooth that was broken, but on the other phone, it still sounded bad... I came to the conclusion that the headphones are very very low quality and sound worse than headphones you'd get for free.I honestly think that the Skullcandy Ink'd 2 sounds better than these headphones and I'm going to stick with the Ink'd 2's until I a pair of wireless headphones that sound better than a $12.50 earbud.

Good look, seriously uncomfortable


Extremely uncomfortable. They look nice but they hurt my ears, I tried all the different tips and they didn’t make a difference. She. You bend it to fit over your ear it doesn’t hold that shape at all. The wire inside is super pliable and it wouldn’t stay on unless I crimped it as close to my ear as possible (which was uncomfortable). Not having a remote on the wire was a bit confusing and an adjustment. For calls I’ve been told that it’s difficult for the receiver to hear me when I am using these. The mic is within the bud. I accidentally called several people because a certain pattern of presses will redial the last number. Maybe I could’ve adjusted and looked past all this if the sound quality were at least good. Perhaps this pair has a defect, I don’t know, but there is a constant crackling in the background of all the audio. It’s quiet, like a crinkling, almost static noise. On the breaks between songs or calls/ when I pause a video to walk somewhere it’s there and it drives me nuts.

First Impression: Outstanding Value!


I ordered 2 models of Senso headphones; the A1 and the S-250. Although the appear to be the same model, they sounded completely different. The S-250 sound when playing music was muddy with distorted bass even when I turned the bass EQ down on my iPhone 7 Plus it still sounded bad. I fired up the A1 set and the sound was much more balanced without the distorted bass or muddy mids. I returned the S-250s.I had a change to really give the A1's a workout a few days ago and wore them while working in the yard for hours. I found them to sound great and be very comfortable with no loss of connection to the phone in my pocket. I did find that the wire kept rubbing on my neck and pulled out my left earphone. Next time I plan to use a cinch button to help hold the headphones in place. I also recommend the memory foam tips instead of the silicon tips. They do a better job of sealing the ear canal and help them stay in place. All in all I'm very please!

Senso S250 is the best Bluetooth headphone that I ever owned: (a) Great sound quality; (b) very comfortable to wear; (c) easy to pair - it has the voice prompt to indicate whether the power is turned on or off, the device is connected or disconnected; (d) a fancy carry case; (e) a thoughtful power cable which has a double connectors to iPhone and USB device; and (f) water-proof rating (I have not tried this feature; but I have already ruined two sets of Bluetooth headphones by clean them with too wet of clothing after running). While the power button is large and easily accessible, the volume/track control buttons may be too tiny for some people, which one seldom uses once the device is set up, so I don't care. In the last few years I have gone through at least five sets of Bluetooth headphones: they either stopped working or were not good/comfortable for running. Senso S250 is the first perfect pair I discovered. I loved it so much that I reordered three additional sets for each of my family member.Update: One of the four sets I brought stopped working in less than 6 weeks. I used it to run for about 1 hour a day 4x a week, indoor. One day it just would not turn on. Don't think I would give this product a high rating when it does not last for more than 6 weeks for normal use.

Okay but bulky


Not sure how to rate these earbuds. Sound quality is fine but not amazing. Build is okay but not amazing. I found the connecting strap to be both too short but also getting in the way (and the included tiny ties are a joke and fall off easily). All in all they work just fine, and I suppose if you use them for workouts etc, pretty much everything where you don't wear a hat,  you'll be a happy camper. But I was planning to use them on walks to listen to podcasts or music, and here's the rub. I'm in New England, it's winter, and that means, it's cold outside and you'd better were some head wear such as a beanie. While the piece that goes in the ear is okay (they actually come with adapters in different sizes) it's the large bulky pieces on the outside that kills you. With any kind of pressure on them (eg from a beanie) they hurt like hell. I've never had that problem with a design like the (wired) earplugs that come with an iPhone. Guess I will be looking for a new pair.

Works Great for Golf Course Worker


Here's the bottom line, these Bluetooth headphones work great! Was tired of the old headphones getting caught on things. I have an iPhone 7 and when apple switched from the aux port to the lighting port, it now works like S**t. The lighting port makes it sensitive when I bump the bottom of the headphone jack and will pause my music. Bluetooth was the way to go. They fit very nice and there are different size pieces to fit in all different size ears. They hold around the ear well too. The sound quality is top notch, even at its lowest volume setting. There is a dual charging cable that comes along with which is awesome. If you have an apple lightning port, you can charge your phone and headphones at the same time with just one cable. Only downside is that the cable will not fit into my otter box case but that's not a huge deal. Overall I am very happy with these headphones. They were easy to pair and connect to my phone automatically when I turn them on.

When they work, they're great, when they don't, they are maddening...


I had been looking at a multitude of bluetooth/wireless headsets before purchasing this one, which I kept coming back to...then crossed paths with a friend of mine that happened to have bought these very ones...and he raved about them, so I bought them. To sum up my experience with them; when they worked, they worked great...but when they didn't work, they were maddening to deal with. They always seemed to be all or nothing...their connectivity seemed weak at times, regardless of charge-level. Spot on, or skipping like a scratched CD due (i'm guessing here) to poor connectivity,  whether connected to either the apple watch on my wrist or the smart-phone in my pocket. Pairing; sometimes they connected instantly, sometimes I had to turn them and the bluetooth on either the phone or the watch on or off, and multiple times to get them to connect...I have an iphone, and while I didn't use them a great deal of the time, after a few months of having to fight with them every other time I wanted to use them, I just bit the bullet and bought the apple air-pods...

You get what you pay for


I've been using these for two months.Pros:Headphones stay in ears firmlyOutside noises are significantly quieterThe volume gets more than loud enoughCons:Sound quality is below average. It's acceptable for talk radio or spoken podcasts, but music is muffled and there is no treble.The left earbud is louder than the right. I have to loosen the left one a bit to even the volume out.The wire gets caught on my shirt, so when I turn my head, the earbud tries to come out of either ear.Sometimes they disconnect suddenly, then reconnect. It will do this several times in a row. I have to turn them off manually and then back on.Summary:  These earbuds are the same as the other ""cheap"" ones being sold on Amazon. You get what you pay for. In the long run, you're better off buying higher quality bluetooth earbuds than going cheap and being frustrated.

High quality headphones at a reasonable price!


Exactly what I was looking for! These stay put while I'm running. Flexible, siliconized ear wire is comfortable & adaptive to individual ear shapes and sizes. You might have to spend a few minutes initially getting them adjusted for your anatomy, but then they stay comfortably conformed for repeat use. (I am a woman with very small and closely configured outer ears. Sometimes the ear pieces from sunglasses bother me. However, the ear wires on these headphones are very slender, malleable, and comfortable.) I find the HD foam tips better @ blocking external sounds. Music is crisp with good tonal balance (bass/treble); signal is consistent (no 'skips' in the audio stream) with iphone 10 ft away on my desk. Controls are easy to utilize. Visibly innocuous! These come very well-packaged and include a nicely designed, sturdy soft-sided travel case that holds the headphones and accessories (which includes a car charger).  Because they're tandem, one side won't go missing.  You could pay a lot more, but why???  These really are high quality at a very palatable price point.  They also come with a one year warranty and coupon for 10% off a subsequent purchase...very nice additional incentive. You owe it to yourself to check these out.  Wouldn't surprise me if they become the go-to brand for discerning customers who want affordability as well as quality.

Pretty good for the price


So, taking into account the fact that they're ~$36, I'm giving them 5 stars.These headphones are interesting. I've never had around the ear earbuds like these before, though I've had around the ear headphones. I should also say I haven't had any other pair of sports headphones around this price range, so I can only attest to what I have. I own a pair of Skullcandy Method wireless sport earbuds, so that's what I have to compare with these Senso's.When I got them, I was really worried about the hooks. They are REALLY flimsy. They have no backing, and they feel like they weren't going to be functional. I actually almost returned them on the spot because of this. HOWEVER, I decided to give them a go, and worked out with the set. They didn't fall out when I ran, or when I was lifting weights, or doing ab work outs. I was a bit surprised, so I've decided to keep them.My only other complaint with the headphones was the quality of the sound. Granted, I own a pair of $200 headphones, as well as $120 pair, and the skullcandy set. The skullcandy's were crisp and clear with the mids and highs, and had an okay synthetic bass. The Sensos seem to have traded the crispness of the mids and highs for some bass. I was really happy listening to EDM and anything with a good bass kick as the centerpiece. However,vocals, midrange, and high range left me a little disappointed. Again, I have mildly expensive music tastes (never owned beats though, hell no).The reason I gave 5 stars, and why I'm not really using the skullcandy's, was because the skullcandy's fall off my neck every time I laid down; these didn't slip at all. Also, Skullcandy's are about $15 more expensive. So for the price, you're getting something thats pretty decent. I'd like to give 4.5 stars, but that's not really an option. If they somehow cleaned up the sound and made the bands a bit more stiff, I'd be %100 behind the brand.

Excellent sound quality!


I know nothing about buying headphones but wanted them for my iPhone 7. I bought these based on the reviews I read and my needs. I like they go around your ears and you don't have to worry about them falling out when you're running. The wire behind your head is so unnoticeable. It doesn't even bother me.  I don't know it's there. The buttons on the head piece are easy to access and press.  They give you a lot with this product as well. I was surprised to see a three feet dual port charging cable inside the package too. That was a nice little surprise. If you want quality headphones with awesome sound then these are them!  I'm so impressed by the sound quality. I thought I would have to have it up to the highest decimal like my old headphones the whole time. Not these. I have them on half that.  I love them! I bought the grey and black ones and think they look sharp. I didn't want the red or blue ones sticking out and being so noticeable. I had no problem with pairing them either.  Got it the first try.  Was simple. No code necessary. It also comes with an awesome zip up case for them too which is a nice bonus.  You really get your money's worth.

poor bluetooth connectivity


I went through 5 different sub- $50 blue-tooth headsets before landing on these Senso ones.  There are hundreds of blue-tooth earbuds out there... all  of them I tried had very weak sound, poor bluetooth connectivity, extremely low volumes... just 'sucky' in general.  Even the very expensive ones--Bose, Jabra, etc... had mediocre reviews and seemed to suffer from similar problems.  I was pleasently surprised by these.  Very robust, deep sound and good treble... comfort is good... they don't look terrible. They connect with my iPhone 8 immediately upon powering up.  Battery life is very good... I must have listened at least 3 hours so far with no re-charging...advertised to last a lot longer than that.  I had some disconnection issues where audio was interrupted breifly when I walk in the city (NYC)..but I think this is because of all the competing signals/activity in a congested area.  Normally, they work pretty well. The only thing I don't like is the wire that connects them... but resolved to let it just sit in the front like a necklace instead of behind my head which was annoying as hell. I also like the foam ear-plug style bud attachments which does to some limited sound isolation--I noticed this helped on the train compared to the standard bud attachments.  So... until a better technology comes out for individual wire-less buds that doesn't look like Q-tips hanging from your ears, I will stick with these.

Excellent Value


I've used these for over a year with no problems.  I paid so little for them I didn't expect much quality and, frankly, didn't wear them except to try them out to see if they worked.  I continued using my corded Bose earbuds without really giving these a chance.  I finally tired of the cord flopping around and used these - blown away.  I didn't know I could use them for phone calls and stumbled over that when I received one.  They work great and people on the phone don't seem to realize I'm on a headset.  I have a lot of items that use Bluetooth and my phone is normally connected to something - a car, a speaker, or a camera, etc., so I have to go through a connection process if I put them on in my house, but if I turn them on while on my driveway they automatically connect.  That  problem results from using a point-to-point technology with multiple items and isn't the earbuds' problem.

Almost Perfect


I have tried four sets of bluetooth headphones, and these are by far the best in the $20-$40 range. I am using them with an iPhone 7.Pros*The ear hooks help these to stay in my ears, even when I run.*They are connected by a wire so not easily lost.*I can use them to talk on the phone, and the other person can hear me.*The sound quality is good.*I can comfortably lie on my back while wearing these (unlike earbuds that are connected with hard plastic).*They stay connected to my iPhone while in use and have a good distance range away from my phone, at least one room away.Cons*The blue flashing light is SO annoying in a dark room. Flashing to show it is paired is completely unnecessary. I know it is paired because it is working. I read another reviewer put electrical tape over the light. I might try that, but I don’t want my hair to get caught on the tape. Also, the same light is red when it is charging so I am hesitant to cover that.*The sound does not get quiet enough for my taste. I wish I could turn these down one more notch. The volume button on the headphones adjusts the volume of my iPhone and vice-versa.

Worked less than 2 months, 2 different sets


Use them on treadmill at gym.  Gym is noisy, so wanted in-ear style.  They were OK, even with the over-ear hooks having all of the weight at the buds meant they didn't stay in great, but I would have given them 3-4 stars.  Sound was fine.But after about 2 months of use they don't turn on anymore.  I don't expect gym headphones to last a long time, but I expect them to last longer than this...EDIT:  They were good about following up, sent me a new pair with no hassle on my part.  So raising from one star to three.  Because they don't stay on my ears well, I had already moved to a new brand by the time I got these though, so not currently using them.  Gym headphones don't typically last long though, so probably will be back to these at some point...Further edit:  Back to one star.  I started using the new pair about 2 months ago.  They started failing last week.  Several times I've had them just cut out half an hour into a run.  They shut off, won't turn on.  Not low on power.  I suspect it is sweat getting into the charger flap, which seals very poorly.  All three times they started working again after a few hours (without charging).  They dried out?  Anyway, into the headphone trash pile they go.

Great steal, but not without its issues


I'm giving 4 stars because you cant beat the price for what you get. Some people said these sound as good as Beats.  I beg to differ, I don't own any beats but I used to sell them when i was at best buy.  The reason I didn't give a 5 is because, 2 issues, 1 pretty annoying, when I have my phone and apple watch, it always wants to connect to both.  So i have to disconnect from the phone but if the watch doesn't sinc with it and I try to pair again, it will pair with the phone again, so then i have to turn blue tooth off on my phone and turn it back on once it connects to the watch.  The second happened today.  B4 leaving for the gym I check the battery life, it showed 65%, so about 45 min into the workout I get ""battery low"", i check the status on my watch and it showing 30% and 5 min after, it cut off.  I turned it back on checked the battery lvl... 30%... then it cut off again.In addition yes these bad boys sound great!  As good as beats I don’t know but they sound better than the $60 blue tooth phone I have.  One other issue is that it will try to connect to a previously paired device even when u are paired to another device.  Its paired to my iPhone and listening to music, my Apple Watch is charging, when I get into connecting distance it tries to connect and stops playing

These are OK sound quality, but poor UX, and I will buy a different pair next time


These are ""OK"". I'm no audiophile, but I found the sound quality fine. The microphone however, did not seem to work well. Whenever I used these for conversation people complained about my audio quality.I also found that I had a lot of problems with reliable audio transmission; it would frequently ""skip"" a bit. The most reliable way to make it skip was simply to have it pair to two devices, and then walk away from the one you were not using; e.g. I would have it paired to my laptop and my phone, then when I walk away from my laptop while playing audio from the phone. It starts stuttering every 5 seconds or so, I *think* because it was spending too much radio time trying to talk to the laptop? I don't know, but it was pretty annoying because once this happens I can't actually unpair it without going back to the laptop to do so.Also, you can't use them at all while they are charging.

Great pair of headphones for the price. A must have workout accessory.


Excellent headphones for the price. I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones that I can use during workouts and running. But, I did not want to shell out a premium price for something like Beats or Bose. I got these headphones for a good price on Prime Day and boy, are these one of the best headphones that I've used. The sound quality is crystal clear, the bluetooth range is great, you can make calls while using them which is a handy feature and the accessories that came alongwith it are great. One complaint that I might have from these is that the active noise cancellation is not at par with the best in the market. I have a pair of bose over-ear headphones and beats studio wireless which do a good job when it comes to noise cancellation. But again, for the price that I paid for these Senso headphones, I'm totally fine with the quality of noise cancellation. I use them while I'm running and they fit nicely on my ear without falling off during intense sessions of activity. I highly recommend these headphones for someone who's looking to have a good pair for workouts/jogging etc. where you might sweat a lot and damage regular headphones.

Takes some messing with it for good connection to the phone.


I tried, I really did try to like these.  The first set weren't waterproof and died after a couple weeks.  No big deal.  They didn't connect to my iPhone most of the time, anyway.  Got the replacement set and same issues.  Sometimes it would connect, most of the time not.  If I played with it long enough, it would eventually connect with the iPhone.  Then there is the range issue.  If my phone is in the kitchen and I walk to the bathroom, about 25-feet, I loose the signal.  Continuously listening to a book, these earphones are good for about five-hours before they die.  I dared not take them to the water because the ""waterproof"" cover for the volume controls came off one day.  Now for the good news...for the price, they aren't too bad, assuming you don't mind playing with them all the time to get them to connect...let me restate that...they almost always connect but it is almost always a one-way connection.  I can control the iPhone but no sound comes out the earpieces without my messing with it for five-minutes turning off and back on again.  You get what you pay for.

They work, but are poorly designed


These have functioned OK so far.  However, I'm not sure I would recommend them for several reasons.  They are heavy on the bass, but it's not a good sound.  It reminds me of the sound of the cheap car stereo I had in my first car, with cheap speakers.  I would lower the treble and crank the bass.  It was a bad, muffled bass-heavy sound.  So it's not good that these remind me of that.  Also, they are accidentally turned on far too easily.  I keep them in their original case in my book bag. They are off when I put them in the case, and later I often find that they are on and connected to a device.  And finally, they get tangled up with the seatbelt in my truck when I have them draped around my neck, but not in my ears. When I remove my seatbelt, the ear hook of the left earpiece gets caught on it.  On a frustrating day, that nearly led to a ""Snoopy lawnchair moment"".  The cord keeper disappeared on the third day of use.  I never used it anyway, so I don't miss it.  A spare cord keeper is supplied with the earbuds, along with extra earpieces of varying sizes, a car charger, short and long USB to micro USB charging cables with a lightning connector adapter (the earbuds have a micro USB port).

Finally, good ear buds.


For the summary: I love everything so far. I've been through Hell trying to find a decent pair of wireless ear buds, and I've finally found them.I was recommended these by a work colleague and friend whose advice I trust. So I decided to give these a shot. I've been burned before many times, so I was very happy when I received these and......they actually worked! For longer than a week, even!Most of the ear buds I've purchased usually short out in a wire, or are riddled with other problems. For example, poor LED visibility; come on, I need to know if it's charged and it shouldn't take an act of God to show me this very basic information. Or, in one case, the ear buds wouldn't even hold a charge - well, I'm certainly gonna get real far with that setup! It's all supremely frustrating when it happens. I'm happy that I've found something that works!I am very impressed with the quality of the wire connector between the two - it looks and feels heavy-duty. The ear configuration is adjustable, and feels pretty good overall. It was weird to figure out at first, but I'm just stupid and after I figured them out it was easy. Charging time is breezy - I haven't had a chance to fully drain them of power yet but the two times I have charged them it's been quite quick at less than hour or so. I can't really remember the times off the top of my head, but  The LED indicator is actually visible and nice in these as well - the last two pairs I've purchased you could not clearly see the LED indicator. It was frustrating because I had to crane at different viewing angles to actually see if they had held a charge. These are quite the opposite.I was also very pleasantly surprised to receive a magnetic sticker, a magnetized base to hook my phone into in the car, a carrying case, and a wallet card holder along with the ear buds. I don't really need the wallet card holder, but I could see the usefulness of it. The case feels nice and is fairly high quality. It's nice for holding the other sized buds, as well as the charging cord. It has a inner mesh which has a good strength to it. However, I've used it sparingly. That is not for a lack of want and it's very nice - you won't be disappointed.The magnetic phone holder, on the other hand, I needed desperately. I am happy to report that that it's wonderful as well. The magnet is actually pretty strong despite its size, both on the base and the sticker that it attaches to on the phone. I was happy to see that there were two different size adjustments. It's designed to go into an air grill in your vehicle, and while I could see that being a problem (it is blocking airflow in one of the car grills), it's a fantastic trade-off and I love that thing about as much as the ear buds. A+++.Extremely content with my purchase. The designers obviously cared for the product and I'm elated I finally found ear buds that aren't lemons. If I need another pair of ear buds in the future, I know who I am turning to. Thank you!

Okay, but not as advertised.


Good battery life, good Bluetooth connection.  No bass, terrible voice.Listening to music is not pleasant.  The bass is almost completely absent.  They work fine for listening to podcasts and news.  Being wireless is more than just a convenience when I'm walking four dogs.  The fit is comfortable and I can wear them for hours without even noticing they are there.  I forgot to pick up my phone, and the bluetooth didn't cut out until I was at least 30 feet away.  This is a great improvement over past headsets where I had to have my phone in the front pocket, not the back pocket, to avoid losing the signal.  Trying to use them for a phone call is completely pointless.  I sound like I just landed on the moon, but less clear.This set will definitely be useful for some situations, but it does not work as advertised.  I wanted to be able to use them to make phone calls, and that isn't happening.

Pros, cons, and should you buy it? Yes!


The Senso Bluetooth Headphones are great headphones. They sound great, are nice and loud, have good bass, and fit relatively well.Pros: 8 Hours battery life. Wireless. Loud. Nice bass. Not flimsy. Quality plastic. Includes 2 chargers- 2 micro usb, car charger, 1 lightning apple charger, carrying case, multiple earbuds, and a warranty.Cons: Not well balanced. Needs an anchor in the middle to keep from flying all over. The over the ear hooks fit on one side and are loose on the other* (really depends on how big your ears are). Takes around 15+ seconds to connect to phone (could be my phone but previous headphones never took that long to connect and were always instant).SHOULD YOU BUY IT??!?!?!? Yes. You can not find a better deal than this for what it comes with and how well it product is. If they break, make sure you registered them online because then you are covered by a 1 year warranty. Hope this review helps. Would rate 4.5 stars out of 5 but thats not an option.Update: dropped these in a mop bucket filled with soapy water. They were completely submerged. After pulling them out i turned them off to let them dry. These things are 100% water proof. They work perfectly. I was worried that I'd have to use my warranty but i didnt. 5/5 stars no doubt

Decent sound.  Good battery life.  Annoying rattle while running/jogging.


This is my 4th set of these earbuds.  The sound and battery life are good as expected.Each time the content and quality seems to be slipping.  Gone are the foam inserts and the extra magnetic phone holder pieces.  I can accept this - I understand that companies need to be profitable and optimize the product content for things the customer is willing to pay but I do expect basic things like minimal build quality and some form of customer service when things don't go well. .I really wanted to like these earbuds but unfortunately, there is an annoying rattle coming from the right side earbud.  The rattle drowns out the music while running/jogging.  I have attempted to contact the company via their website but no response as of 2 weeks.  I'm a bit concerned they will not stand behind their product.  Just disappointing.  Buyer beware...

Still work even after being washed


As a runner, I got these as a fairly inexpensive option to listen to music but not worry if they got wet during a run and had to be replaced. Not only have I worn them for two years in all temperatures, from -20F to 90F, they’ve been on in snow and rain, and still work. What finally prompted me to come back and write a review is that I accidentally put them through the washer and dryer with my clothes AND THEY STILL WORK. Just wow.Sound quality is good, they stay on well and toggling pause, advance a song, take a phone call etc. is pretty easy to do. I actually had purchased a backup pair for the day they might get wet and stop working, gave the extra to my boyfriend when he was frustrated with the poor battery life on his headphones, and he is happy with them too.

Great for Working out - lots in one package


Purchased this one to work out. The box comes with the headset precharged. Paring it with my Iphone 7 was extremely easy. The sound is excellent, noise cancelling and all. I played with the settings in the iphone (Settings - Music) and it seems to respond very well to the different equalizing options (dance, pop, rock, bass booster, etc). The fit around my ears is excellent also. I used them out of the box without changing the earpieces and they fit me perfectly. Went for a run (5k) sweating quite a bit and they held up perfectly. One of the problems I usually have with these type of headphones is that the cord tends to dance around and that is annoying. These headphones don't have that problem, they come with a cable tie gadget, so I can tame the cable either around my neck or under my chin, nice feature.It also comes with a nice case and and extra charging cable for both iphone and android.Battery held pretty well for a run, and around the house. Finally, I tested the mike in a couple of calls and they went through nicely. Will buy another one as they are excellent for the price.

I Like Them (Factory Reset Instructions)


I really like these. I don’t have a lot of experience with headphones, but they fit nicely without going too far into my ear.The only thing I don’t like is the cord that connects the earbuds. It curls up on itself and ends up touching you on your sweaty neck. So I sometimes pin it up to my hair. For the price, maybe they could have used a better cord.As for sound, I’m a total amateur. I can only tell you that it sounds fine to me. When I first connect them, the sound goes in and out a few times before it settles down and plays, but that only takes a few seconds.Overall, it seems like a good set of Bluetooth headphones.Update 06/23/2018: After 8 months, these headphones no longer paired or connected. I found the instructions for how to do a hard reset and that fixed the problem.1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.I also had to remove Activbuds (these headphones) from each device and re-pair them. Trying to the connect to the old pairing wasn't working.

way better than expected!


I'm not a techie, but more a commuter who needed headphones on the train.  I didn't want to spend too much, but I didn't want to have super crap headphones.  I always had issues with bluetooth headphones and was one of those diehard fan of wired headphones because I hate when someone can't hear you on the phone, or the battery dies and you have nothing to listen to for the rest of your 1 hr train commute.  I love the case, and that they include a charging cord and all the sizes of earpieces so when your ear canal starts aching, you can switch it out to a smaller size, and its all right there in your case!  The battery life has been great so far - I commute up to 4 hrs a day roundtrip on the train.  The one thing is the phone call quality may not be optimal, but who really makes that many phone calls these days?  All in all, great for the price!

The Unit Worked Well While It Lasted


I purchased this unit and was quite pleased with the sound quality.  Finding the right size ear plugs was not too difficult.  The unit came with three different sizes.  The malleable over the ear loop took a little getting used to.  I had very little issue using the phone function.  Most of the time people could hear me when I called them using the phone and the bluetooth function.My biggest gripe is that after six months, the unit has stopped working.  I press the power button on the fully charged headset and...nothing.  No voice stating that my headset was powered on and that I was connected.  I figured it was just a glitch, so I didn't use it for a few days.  I made sure the battery was fully charged with the blue light (blue light = fully charged versus red light = needing a charge) and, still, nothing.I am just going to wait a few days and just keep my fingers crossed to see if this situation changes.  If not, I will try to contact the vendor and find out what my potential options are.Good luck to you all.

The unit itself is very easy to set up and easy to use


The sound quality on these headphones is crystal clear. The unit itself is very easy to set up and easy to use. It comes with a number of different accessories that I probably won't use but it's the thought that counts. Like for instance the car adapter, I must have 30 of these things. 25 in the car somewhere, under the seat maybe, I don't really know, I've looked for one but cannot find it. so I just use the recharge cord in in the house. I had this unit up and running in under 30 minutes, it was easy and I was very surprised at how well it sounded. The headphones themselves are very light and comfortable, which you would think would make this set tinny and not very soundproof, but that's not the case. The music or podcast is very present and noise from the outside does not leak in, even at a low volume. I talk to myself a lot and need this as a way to cover for the voices that I hear, I bought them to be able to pretend to be on a call. Oops, gotta go, gotta call coming in. Would recommend.

Overall, definitely worth the money, but NOT WATERPROOF, MIC. IS NOT GREAT


I think if they were not so much overselling in the title (waterproof, noise cancellation etc.) I would have rated in 5 stars.Cons...First of all, it is not waterproof as I was lucky enough to go through reviews before taking them to the pool with me. They are only advised to be used under rain and not while swimming.Second, they are not noise cancelling, they merely come with earbuds that are very similar to night time ear buds that foams in your ear and blocks some of the noise, but of course this is not the definition of noise cancellation. On the other hand it is a great fit.Third; they seem like a bit heavy on the bass but you can correct that with the equalizer of the source (for ex. when listening spotify)Fourt; the mic sucks, especially if you have paired it with 2 devices. So think twice if you are planning to buy this for talking on the phone much.the mic. seems to have a problem when it is connected to 2 devices. when I am only on my mobile I can talk without needing to remove the ear with the mic and holding it to my mouth.Pros..1- Very light and good fit with the foam like ear buds. however if you need to put on the regular type earbuds because these are somehow small or else than it looses all the touch.2- eventough it is not advertised, they match with 2 devices which is great. so I can listen the music from my computer but talk through them when I receive a call on my mobile. However, as I wrote before the mic. seems to have a problem when it is connected to 2 devices. when I am only on my mobile I can talk without needing to remove the ear with the mic and holding it to my mouth.

Great sound for the price. Good bass!


By far the best and comfortable earphones I’ve purchased. The price is awesome as well. I’ve purchased these repeatedly (I lose them, break them while working-my fault!) and will order a replacement when the time comes.I get 8-10 hours of straight play time.Only two negative things, one is that I wish the Blue LED light was so bright at night. Dark nail polish will fix that!Two, once you determine which soft plastic inserts fit your ear, dab a small amount of super glue so they stay on the plastic ear piece. Other than that, the sound is great, price is great! Recommended. I love them!

Review of SENSO Bluetooth Wireless Headphones by Phillip Elli


The SENSO Bluetooth Headphone is a great value. The unit pairs easily with cell phones, computers, and other Bluetooth devices. The sound quality however appears to be to the base side. There is plenty of volume and the sound is very clear. There were no dropouts as far away as 30 feet with no walls in between. Wearing comfort is better then most units of this type. It comes with a variety of headphone tips to fit big and small ear canals. They are made of a soft rubber material that conforms to your ear canal in a very comfortable manor.  The controls for volume, phone, track ahead or behind, and on off, are easily accessible on the right headphone. The phone functions appears to be adequate under most conditions.  I haven't had a chance to run the unit at length to determine run time before battery recharge. I have used it probably 3 hours at one time and it still appeared to have charge left. Other then the sound being somewhat to the base side, the unit operates well, is comfortable, and clear sounding.  I would recommend this unit to a friend.

Outstanding Value!


I've only had these for a few days, but have used them for close to 20 hours and could not be more pleased.  Since I listen to podcasts and audio books just about non-stop, battery life is very important to me.  I was skeptical of the SENSO's stated 8 hour battery life, due in part to Apple saying that their Airpods (at over 5 times the price) can go only 5 hours between charges.  My experience so far with the SENSOs is that, for the kind of listening I do, the battery last for at least 8 hours.  How long the battery will continue to perform at this level is unknown at this point.  At my level of use, I'll be very pleased if the battery continues to perform for a year.  If it does, I'll gladly buy another pair next year!  One other thing I'll like to mention is the many extras included with the SENSOs.  They come with 3 sets of silicon eartips in 3 sizes and a set of foam eartips, a short ribbon-style charging cable, a longer ribbon cable with a micro-USB plug AND a Lighting adapter for charging an iPhone, a dual USB car lighter adapter and a nice case to hold it all.  All of these accessories seem to be of good quality.  This impresses me since my $200 FitBit Surge  came with a charging cable and nothing else..  They didn't even throw in a USB power source of any kind.  This makes me feel like SENSO is trying to earn every penny I paid for their product while companies like FitBit (they are not alone in their apparent belief that customers are fortunate to own one of their priducts) make me feel like a sucker.

Good for the price…


This is my second pair of these headphones. I use them daily on the construction site so they’re not necessarily getting an easy life. The first pair I couldn’t have wished for better. Obviously nothing is going to last forever. However, my second pair had issues only a few weeks after receiving them and only lasted 3 months before it became impossible to turn them on anymore. Will there be a 3rd pair? Not without trying something else first.

Sound very good, but have to send them back ***Update 8/5/19***


***UPDATE 8/5/19***After receiving my refund in a timely manner, I tried several other types and brands of Bluetooth headphones. Then, I bought a second pair of the Sensos. I have since used them in the same conditions as the first pair over a dozen times and they have performed admirably. Had the first pair worked properly I might have considered a slightly higher rating. That said, I'm still enjoying their use after spending over a year with them.****I really like these headphones. They fit well and sound very good for the money. They are not audiophile quality by any means, but for what I paid they have decent bass. Mids and highs are a little better. Very livable and listenable sound. They fit comfortably and stayed on well, even during  strenuous activities. Buuutttt, when moving around they breakup a lot. With the phone in my cargo pocket less than 3 feet from the headphones and walking they are annoying due to the breakup. Same setup, but cutting or weed eating the grass, they are unlistenable for 20-30 second stretches of time. Tried them with phone and tablet. When sitting still, they sound great.

Buying a second one (because first lost in a marathon) so it must be good to go back to.


Lost mine on the Marine Corps Marathon when I stopped to say a prayer at mile 12 the Blue Mile. Anyway, I’m ordering a second pair after owning the first for four or five months. That should tell the reader enough, I’m buying them again.i run marathons so long runs, these are great. That means between getting to the run and after the run at events, I’m satisfied with the quality of battery life... and I am a year old runner who takes over four hours to finish a marathon.Sound quality... I listen to books thrpugh my iPhone on Audible. I’m happy with the sound. When I do have music on, the quality is fine. I have 60 year old ears damaged from years on nuclear submarines.Appearance... they seem bulky, but again at 60, I’m more in favor of what works than what things look like.Charging... the cord it came with died, but I just got a spare micro usb cord and it works fine.So to sum up... I. Buying again. And at this price, I skip warranties.

Game changers


I was looking for a cheap pair of wireless headphones to use especially for commuting and exercising. I went with these based on the reviews and I am very glad I did. In terms of quality, these are undoubtedly some of the best headphones I've ever owned, regardless of any price range. The sound is perfectly crisp. I listen to various music types, from classical to modern day hip hop and old school rock. All of these sound exactly like they should.I have used these while running, sprinting, jumping and catching (I play Ultimate Frisbee). I wanted a pair of headphones that allowed me to listen to pump up music during warm-ups, and these are absolutely perfect. They have never fallen out, sometimes they slide off a little bit due to sweat, but overall I very rarely need to adjust them once they're in, unless it's a 90 degree summer day with high humidity.The battery life is very good, I always charge them fully before going to sleep at night and they last me all day next day. I use them about 3 hours a day, and have yet to even get the low battery warning, let alone have them die on me.Overall, I highly recommend these to anyone, whether you need these for work, sports or anything in between. Hands down one of the best investments i've ever made

4 Brief Impressions of the Senso Bluetooth Earbuds


4 Brief Impressions of the Senso Bluetooth Earbuds1) Sound Quality: Much better in my opinion that Taotronics that I also tried. Bass and mid-range are excellent for earbuds, although the high-end, treble clarity cannot compare to good quality wired headphones or even my cheap $10, wired JVC HA-EB75 earbuds. Very efficient sound (loud at low play volume levels).2) Bluetooth Connectivity & Range: Excellent! Easy to connect and great range (at least 30 feet without walls).3) Comfort & Fit:  Great if you are just sitting or walking slowly. I can wear them for long hours without discomfort. However, apparently my ears may be on the small side and they don't hold well when I'm running or exercising.  The ear wraps are soft & pliable, which is great for comfort but not so great when you are in high motion.4) Build Quality: Not good at all.  Initially I thought the controls were solid.  Compared to the Taotronics, they turned on quite easily (one large button on the side of the right piece to turn on/off,  two small buttons on top for volume and forward/reverse).  Unfortunately after a few short weeks of constant use, the controls completely failed, rendering the device unusable.  The top tiny controls actually collapsed into the earpiece and the side on/off controls froze. Too bad because overall, I liked these earbuds.Although all the other qualities of these earbuds are above average, based upon the extremely poor build quality of it's controls, I have to give it only one star and I'll be returning it.

Pretty darn good for the price


I use these 3-4 days a week while working out. At least 3 of the days I am lifting weights for around 2 hours, as I do powerlifting. The fourth day is some sort of cardio, usually running. For both the gym and running, these are perfect. You can get them quite loud (if you’re like me and turn it way up when you’re about to do a set) or just mild enough to hear it and not destroy your eardrums. Bluetooth them to my iPhone for the first time and I find that the best EQ for them is “Rock,” which balances the bass out a little more. Sometimes (without the proper EQ and/or adjustments) the bass can be a little crackly and sound like a blown speaker in a car if the volume is up too much or the right adjustments haven’t been taken. “Well why would I want to buy these if I have to do a bunch of stuff to use them?” Well, they’re 20 bucks and you’re just going to workout in them. Go drop 200 bucks on some powerBeats and tell me how long they last. These have lasted me two solid years before I finally broke the earpiece while deadlifting, and the manufacturer sent me another pair.

Good for price, but bulky


I’m not a sound expert, but I think the music sounds fine & I have used them for a few phone calls which has worked well. I’d say battery life is around 4 hours constant use? The part that wraps around your ear doesn’t really change sizes to hug around your ear if you try to squeeze/resize it. It’s too big for my ear, but they stay in pretty well while I’m running. I often have a headband on anyway that I put around them & they are a little bulky for that. There was one day the wind was blowing & I didn’t have a headband on & since they’re a little bulky there was a LOT of wind noise. I was a little worried about the cord flopping around as I ran, but I haven’t noticed it.

GREAT for the gym.


GREAT for the gym. Excellent ear buds. They sound great, and fit well. Very comfortable and very easy to set up. Shipped with various sizes of ear cushions, including an extra spongy earplug like type that blocks even a little more noise than the silicon ones, which are adequate. The noise reduction is decent, although from what I can tell it is not an electronics system like my full size headphones. I don't hear any difference in the background noise bleed when I turn them on and off. But their design does block out a significant amount of background noise. I purchased these pretty much for the gym, as I kept knocking the wire out of my traditional headphones and pulling my phone into the floor when I ran. My full-size wireless noise cancelling headphone sound great, but I sweat too much and they become uncomfortable as well as being large and heavy. I'm going to keep the full size ones for ones for when greater noise suppression is needed, such as on an airplane. I am curious to find out if these have electronic technology or if the physical design itself is the only noise suppression they use. As I said, it blocks out more than enough noise at the gym.

Overall good, with one drawback.


I have had these for about a month, I made the purchase after a second pair of much more expensive headphones stopped powering on.  All in all I think they are a good option, especially considering the price.  For what it is worth I use them with an IPhone6.  A few notes on my experience thus far.- Initial set up of the Bluetooth connection is easy as to be expected.  I pretty much use them every day and haven't had an issue with it connecting to the phone when I turn on the headphones.  I did occasionally have that issue with other headphones.- The controls are easy to use.  The power button is on the side of the right earphone, volume buttons are at the top of the same side.- The fit is okay, but not great.  I would like it if it felt more secure but I haven't experienced any huge issues with it falling out of my ears.  The piece that goes over the ear is a bendable not rigid - I think that probably contributes to the way it feels.- To me the sound quality is good, I honestly can not tell the difference between these and the more expensive ones that I had before.- The main drawback from my personal experience the overall loudness of the headphones.  I obviously don't know if it is something related to just this pair I have or if it is an issue with the Bluetooth connection to IPhones in general, but if I am in even a moderately quiet environment the headphones are loud even on the lowest possible volume setting.  I have to turn the equalizer settings in Spotify to the lowest level for it be comfortable for me to listen.  There is a workaround so it is okay, just a little frustrating at times.  I did not have this is issue with other Bluetooth headphones.

Broke within a month


I ordered these headphones a month ago and the connector to recharge them has broken off inside the headphones.  I've had several pairs of headphones with this type of connector and have never had any issues with them.  So these are now useless as they can't be recharged.Additionally, if there is any slight breeze outside, all you can hear in the wind whipping in the  headphones.  You have to turn up the volume to hear your music, then you are blasting your ears off.  Also, after working out for about 20 minutes (I sweat a lot), the right earphone won't stay in my ear.Terrible headphones.  I would not recommend this brand.

Best Ear Buds for Running


I've had these ear buds for 2.5 years and they hold a charge for 2-3 weeks. During that time I will do usually 8-12 hours of running per week.  They don't slip, and they come with different sizes of ear pieces.  They are easy to charge and I don't lose them because I tuck the wire into my hat or pony tail. Lately, I haven't even been tucking the wire in and they don't move. Missouri heat and humidity means LOTS of sweat. The waterproofing is the real deal. The sound quality is wonderful, too! No way would I switch to something else!

Would def buy again. Great sound quality and volume.


Bought these for use with Peloton bike. Super easy and quick to connect. Sound quality is excellent. Great noise cancelling. I sweat a lot and it hasn’t caused any issues. I wear them walking the dogs and they’re great too. I end up with the wire in front of me bc sometimes it catches on my neck and then pulls but once I flipped the wire to the front it’s perfect. Would order again. Took me a few times to figure out how to wedge them into my ear canal. I usually keep them down on the bike and will charge them weekly but one week I has forgotten and got 6 hours of use in without charging. Don’t know how long charge lasts but so far so great. Quality of sound is rich and loud which is what I was looking for but there are plenty of lower levels that it sounds good at also.

Very loud, So far Good, EXCEPT: causing my music to stop playing randomly and repeatedly?


So far, so good with one exception.  I've been using my regular Bluetooth headphones for a while, and as my review noted, I really like them.  Except for one thing, their volume has gone down so much they were pretty much useless during airline flights where the ambient noise made the music indiscernible.  To save me from crying kids and give me my music, I ordered these Senso headphones.  They look nice and synch'd up easily. They are capable of very loud volume (YES!) and a default heavy base (I had to ramp that down for some music).  I took them for a bike ride and sweated like the pig that I am and the functioned well, the only problem being excessive wind noise.  This may be because I used the standard buds instead of trying a larger set--I'll find out.  The ONLY disturbing feature, and the reason why one star has been docked, is because when I use these earphones, the music player on my Samsung Galaxy S7 will randomly stop playing. No reason, warning or anything given. I have to then unlock the screen, and hit ""play"" again.  Is this something anyone else is having problems with?

Great product for the money


My husband has two of these that he has had for over a year.  He uses them in the jacquzzi and has had no issues with the moisture.  I tried using one during my daily walk to listen to podcasts.  It worked so well that I ordered my own that I could keep charged and paired with my phone.  The sound is clear. It has just enough noise cancellation that I'm not too distracted by outside noises, but not so much that I'm in danger of being hit by a car.  I think there is another model that is more noise-cancelling, but being as I want to be aware of my surroundings when I walk, this is perfect for me.  The ear loops can be bent to fit, and I have had minimal problems with the ear pieces falling out.  I never notice the connecting wire when I'm wearing it.  I charge them after my 90-minute walk, although they probably could keep working longer.  I would buy them again without hesitation.

Excited to Find, Excited to Return


I have been meticulously researching bluetooth headphones for a solid six months now, and I landed on this pair based on the large number of high reviews. After receiving them and using them a few times, I wonder why the reviews are so high. Here's my take:They Stay In My Ears-These things look incredibly bulky, so I expected to have them fall out of my ears with the first few steps of my run. Surprisingly this was not an issue and they stayed in on all three of the runs I used them on (longest one was only five miles, though).Sound Quality Is Masked and Actually Quite Poor-To someone without much understanding of sound mix, it would seem the quality is good. It does SOUND like it has a strong bass, but what they did to make that illusion was muffled the sound. What you get is more base, but you lose the mid-range and high-end. I am a musician, and I mix my own in-ear monitors for each show. These were sub-par at best. Muted does not equal solid bass. I was willing to deal with this, but...Wind Noise Is TERRIBLE-There is a microphone on the set, which is nice if you take a phone call. However, there's no way to turn that mic off (that I could find), so you hear the wooshing sound of wind over the mic in both ears if running outside, even if you're just listening to music.Battery Life Is Good-After about 2 hours of use, they're still full. I like that it comes with several charging options (car charger, lightning-to-USB, micro USB),Bottom line is: these are pretty bad. If you're looking for TRUE QUALITY sound, skip this set. I had to find that out the hard way.

I've bought four already


These are seriously great! After purchasing my first pair, I bought two as gifts and bought another for myself as a replacement. Like any bluetooth headphone, these give me freedom and convenience. Now I can lay on my side watching Netflix on my laptop and not have to worry about ruining the headphone jack. I can also walk away from my phone or laptop and keep listening to my music/show. If your TV is bluetooth-enabled, these are also super convenient if the other person in the room doesn't want to hear the TV. What's specifically great about these headphones is that they're really great at noise cancelling, which is a godsend when you're in a noisy environment and need to focus ;P. They're also fairly water resistant, so I can still listen to my music when it's raining out or when I'm washing my face. Also, the controls (play, pause, skip, rewind, volume up, volume down) on these are pretty easy to use and again convenient. I have three different bluetooth headphones, but these are by far my favorite. These headphones also have a longer battery life than most. Other headphones, which retail for far more ($50-70), typically have a battery life of only 6 hours, but the Senso ones have a battery life of 8, which means they'll last you through the workday on a single charge. If you need to hear what's going on, you can keep one headphone in and use the ear clip on the other headphone on your shirt neckline; this will keep it from pulling on the other end, which can be annoying.

Pretty good quality, but I have several issues.


Exterior quality is pretty durable, I like the soft feeling plastic coating on these headphones. They are very comfortable and stay put in my ear without issue. For running on the treadmill, these are perfect. However, taking these outside and running in wind produces very annoying wind-noise. Using a hoodie to cover the headphones fixes this issue.In terms of audio quality, I was slightly disappointed with how these headphones as they sounded fairly muddled. I'm not very a bass loving guy but this pair does deliver pretty amazing bass. There is a low hum sound coming from the left headphone that gets irritating at low volumes but is drowned out at around 20% volume.The battery life on these guys are pretty good, they last around almost a week with moderate use. The ""battery low"" warning is irritating but manageable.Also now, my pair gets occasional split second cuts regardless of its distance to my phone, which gets pretty annoying after a while.

Best value for your money, best headphones at the price.


I've had my Sensos for a month and I waited to make sure I have them long enough and used them enough before I did a review.  Having gone through several different headphones in the last couple of months I am  extremely happy with these.  The fit is great; comfortable, secure, stable.  Furthermore the controls are integrated into the ear phones so there's no annoying control area that hangs awkwardly.  For the most part sweat is not an issue; the only time I've had some issues with sweat on the buds is at the end of an intense 30 or 35 minute run where I've been sweating for most of the workout.  And even then all it needs is a quick wipe and it's ok.  I'm not an audiophile but soundwise it's as good or better as any Skullcandy or JBL headphones I've had.  For the price I can't think of what more you can ask in regards to that.  You also get a lot for your money: a case which while not crush proof is pretty good for keeping them from getting knocked about in a bag and got keeping things like the charging cable and ear buds together.  Speaking of ear buds they give you nice range of tips, silicone and some some foam ones if you prefer.  There's a few other things they add but those are the key things.  Overall I think these Sensos are the best I've gotten for the price and I'd pick them over headphones I've paid more for.

Have been redesigned and not for the better


This is the FOURTH pair of these headphones I've had, and the company has changed things - not for the better. First, on a weird ""why did they do that?"" point, the feedback voice, which had a slightly British female voice, is now an Asian woman's voice. Have no idea why they changed it. Second, the Bluetooth range is less than before. With older pairs I could walk down the hall and still be connected. Here, if I go into the next room the headphones start cutting out. Third, audio feedback is gone. Previously you would get a tone when lowering the volume one click before the volume hit zero. Now there's no tone so when lowering volume you aren't sure if there's just been a pause/silence in your program or whether you lowered the volume all the way to zero. My last two pairs also had the left ear headphone stop working after awhile - obviously from wire connections from the right ear where the electronics mostly are. Overall I don't think I'll get another pair of these,ORIGINAL REVIEW ON FIRST PAIR: I switched to these after the THIRD pair of Trelab headphones I had gave up the cost. While not as light, the battery life is better and they've worked perfectly . I use them for walking, working out, around the office and at home daily.  When I had a problem with the volume switch getting stuck (so that you couldn't increase the volume on the headsets without using the phone app) Senso support quickly replaced the headphone under warranty without issue.

Fine for the price but that's about it.


They stay in my ears, pair up quickly, and last quite awhile on a charge.  For the price I guess they're OK but these reviews are questionable at best.  Everything about them is good except for the most important part which is the sound.  They sound like a $10 pair of earbuds.  Voices sound muted and any kind of bass like you would find in a typical rap song distorts the sound considerably even at low volume.  Outside, these things are almost unusable on any kind of breezy day as they pick up and amplify wind noise more than any other earbuds I have used.Long story short, I gave then 3 stars because if you just want a cheap pair of sweat proof earphones for use in the gym and don't care much about sound quality then these are probably as good as any other in it's price range.  If you want something that sounds good though, spend the extra money and skip these 'off-brand' models.

Decent, but room for improvement, here is why...


They functioned as earbuds, but just not quite what I was hoping for.  I am a runner and when using these on the run they create a lot of wind noise.  For me, the left earpiece did not fit well and caused pain.  I changed out the tips, and the foam helped a bit, but not enough to make them comfortable for extended periods of time.  I never found a reliable way to hang them around my neck and they have fallen several times.  Not a deal breaker, but this could be fixed with a magnet or clip.  The thing that bothered my OCD the most was the fact that the volume buttons are backward.  You would think that the forward button would be volume up and back would be volume down, but you'd be wrong.  Plugging in the charging cable is stiff and you end up mashing some of the buttons in the process.  Not a huge deal, but as an OCD person it was dissatisfying.  They stayed on my ears quite well, and I had no difficulty keeping them on during runs.

Work well. Around 5 hours of continuous use per full charge.


Around 5 hours of continuous run time from full to completely discharged and then about 1 hour to recharge on, I would guess, a pretty standard USB outlet (I've only recharged them as of now with the in-seat USB port of a plane I was on, so I couldn't say how many mA). Didn't try to use them while recharging (took a nap), so couldn't say if they would work. Paired easily enough with anything I've tried thus far. Controls take a little getting used to, but that'll come with time. Audio quality is sufficient, but (as hinted to earlier) I'm primarily using these for listening to movies in a challenging environment (aircraft in flight) so they may well sound better in a more conducive location.Update: After only three recharges, the red charging indicator LED has failed. I don't think this is the end of the world, nor a reason to ask for a warranty fix or replacement, because (and I have yet to establish this with any certainty) I think the blue LED comes on when fully charged. Also, I've now established that you can't use them while they're recharging.

Don’t buy these. Hit or miss.


Ok. I love these headphones in theory because I am a runner and these stay on and they are comfortable and not too expensive.  I have had one pair that lasted almost 2 years until one side died and I decided to order another pair since it was no longer in stereo.  Here is where the 1 star comes in.  These headphones are really hit and miss. I have ordered 4 different pairs of these and 3 out of the 4 died or were defective within the first month.  Since I had one pair that lasted awhile, I really wanted to believe these were flukes and people were asking me why I would order these so many times—-nope.  Time and again these died and I don’t mean the battery died and had to be recharged. Something in the wiring makes these really sensitive and they just don’t work.  Won’t turn on. Charge them fully and still nothing.  I even tried not letting them sit on the charger too long. I tried not charging them until the battery was completely dead...to make a long story short.  I am now going to reluctantly look for a different brand.  The one pair I had that worked for almost 2 years was the fluke.  Don’t waste your money.

Amazing sound! Amazing Price!


Let me start by saying that I am a Crossfitter and an obstacle course racer. I have had many pairs of headphones that I have blown through because of sweat and maximum use.I have been searching for a pair of wireless headphones that were easy on the bank account but had great sound and were sweat/waterproof. I stumbled upon these and after reading the reviews, decided to give them a shot.I will say I was a little worried when I got them out of the box because they were a bit bulky and the piece that goes around the ear is very flimsy. However, the additional items you get are awesome!I wore them to Crossfit and we had a pretty intense workout (running, tire flipping, kettle bell carries, mountain climbers, tire jumps and sandbag work). Not once did they come out, feel uncomfortable or bother me.Even more so, the sound is incredible! The noise cancellation is so good that even with music off, I could barely hear my coach. The bass is deep, treble is loud. I would compare the sound quality with that of the Beats.The change song, volume, pause and other options on the headphones were surprisingly easy. The only thing that I would say is a bit of a downer is the controls are on the earbud portion and not on the cord so it is a little harder to use vs having them on the cord.Overall, these are a steal for the price. I look forward to wearing them in my races and hope that they will last!

LOVE THEM!!!


These work great! I would compare them to PowerBeats2, which cost 3-4 times as much as these. I borrowed my son's PowerBeats2 for several months but needed to get my own pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones. I did my research and decided on these. I have used them only for 2 days, but am convinced they are just as good. Time will tell on the longevity.Of course the ear buds come with a charge cord. But also included is a BONUS charge cord!! Those are always needed at our house! The bonus cord in the package is a USB-to- lightening plug/mini-usb cord. It's so very convenient!! It's either/or lightening or mini-usb! I can use it to charge my iPhone, or my portable battery pack, or several other electronic devices which require mini-usb... all in one!I appreciate the case also, which is a sturdy plastic that zips shut.They are comfortable also... there are several sizes of ear pads to find the comfort needed. The memory foam pads they come with are very comfortable... but they drown out any external noise. That may be desirable to some, but I use them mainly to walk or ride bike and need to hear a vehicle coming.The battery charged very quickly when I got them... went to fully charged in 20 min., and are still going after about 2 hours.I also like the fact that when I put them on, and turn them on, a voice in the ear buds say ""power on""; when connected to device, says ""connected""; and likewise when ""disconnected"" and ""power off""... since the lights aren't always easy to see. This, to me, is an improvement over the beats, which just made a certain noise when turned on, off, and connected.I personally love the idea that they are connected to each other, with a small cord, and fit in, as well as around my ear. I keep things for a long time, and I am certain if they were smaller and not connected, I might lose one.If you are looking for this type of wireless ear buds, I highly recommend these!

I'm amazed at the sound from these little ear buds


Wow! I'm amazed at the sound from these little ear buds. I would preface this review by saying that, if you are using any headphones with a smart phone or PC, you should first of all get yourself an equalizer app for the phone or equalizer software for the PC. It simply will make any headphone set sound better. That being said, these SENSO buds are awesome for sound. I like heavy bass and they give it! I never would have expected sound like this from such a small headphone. The larger headphones like my BEATS are much larger with much bigger drivers to give sound that isn't that much better than these. But remember, if you aren't using an equalizer, you will definitely be missing out their full capability. But even at flat response they are great. I'm not using these for athletics so I can't comment on how they do or don't stay put in my ears other than to say that, while I'm sitting in my easy chair they don't eventually loosen and degrade the sound like some others do. They stay put. Don't hesitate to spend your money on these. I'm sure you'll love them.

Good product with horrible service behind it


So, i purchased the original set less than a year ago, and although i really liked the product, it started to loose around out of the right ear, so i decided to contact customer service as it was under warranty. They were very quick to reply, trouble show and ultimately yo replace the ear buds. So i thought i was extremely satisfied at that point bases on the experience. As everyone should know, a product is only as good as the service behind it, as it will eventually need servicing, so here's where things completely changed. When I got my replacement bud, one plate was completely off, which I managed to snap in place, but another piece, the one that controls volume and forward-backward movement was missing, rendering it pretty useless. So I contacted service, this time, NOBODY contacted me for DAYS, and they said they would help. Since then, I have emailed with two people from service team who helped me with the replacement (4 times) I even sent them pics of the missing piece and they never even bothered to reply, much less fix the situation. Since I am in technology, I know how critical service is to its success, and at this point I want to discourage anyone from purchasing this product based on the complete lack of service from their team.what if the same thing happened to your car?? There are too many other great options for wireless buds on the market to go with one who is so careless and blatant with their lack of support. I will definitely not recommend that anyone but this product unless you want to go thru the same headaches I have. This is a real shame!

Excellent so far - UPDATE, Not as excellent anymore...


Update: Dropping my review from five to four stars after, having only had these a few months and not using them heavily over the last month+, I go to use them today and they are cutting out frequently. Tried restarting them twice, and there's been little to no noticeable improvement. I'm hoping this is not something permanent, as I really do like these headphones overall. I can't stand it when audio cuts in and out, especially when I'm trying to concentrate.I've only had them a few days, but I'm loving these headphones so far.They stay on through a sweaty workout without having to constantly be adjusted - a problem I had with my original set without the over the ear piece and non-silicon earbuds. The sound quality and background noise blockage are fantastic without having to turn everything up too loud.The amount you get for the price is really unbeatable as well. I appreciate that they come with a somewhat hard carrying case that allows me to pack them in my purse without too much fear of them getting damaged or accidentally turned on - which is a very real possibility.At this point I would definitely recommend these earbuds, especially if your work outs are a bit harder. I'll edit later if that changes for any reason!

Want a good workout earbud that won't fall out?  This bud's for you...


For the price you pay, the sound is more than decent.  If you want perfect, studio quality sound while in the gym - it doesn't exist - unless you want to wear large, cumbersome, over-the-ear head phones that cost you $300+If you are like me and looking for something you can wear in the gym, that you can run in, jump in and do burpees and all that jazz, then this is the pair you want.  The best thing about these headphones is the reliability.  You can expect them to ""work"" every session as long as you keep them charged.  Ehh, the occasional vol +/- button failure but it will still play.  Absolutely sweat-proof.  I am a very serious sweater in the gym, often times I walk in with a grey shirt and come out with a black one with sweat dripping off these buds and they keep going.  If the buttons break or won't respond or anything else goes wrong, you can always call Senso and claim the warranty.  That is what I did and they sent another pair out to me very quickly.  I definitely recommend these over those $100+ earbuds any day!  Hope you found this review helpful

Outstanding customer service


I do like these, they removed the cord version from my cycling.  I have to ride with one in my ear and the other out, when on the streets.  Wwhen on bike paths I can utilize both ears.  I have recommended these to my friends and family6/24/18 I initially thought these were good wireless headphones, but though further use, this is not the case.  I have had issues with the music fading in and out.  It was apparent when turning my head right or left it was most notable.  I tested wireless speakers on a bike rides and have not had the same issues.I bought these for activity purposes but they do not seem to function well in that environment.6-24-18 follow up.  I reached out to Senso and they gave me directions to reset the headphones, which thus far fixed the issue.  I will further test them in the environment I was having issues and give a follow up.I gave them 4 stars because of the prompt response and the issue seems the be fixed.  The response was even on a Sunday< Which shows they stand behind their product.

Great for running or for the gym!


I use my Senso bluetooth headphones at least 4-5 times a week at the gym or for running on the trails, and sometimes for long bike rides.  They are fantastic for the price.  Yes, I've listened to much more expensive earphones that had slightly better sound, but honestly, these are among the best-sounding I've experienced in the lower price range (and I've tried quite a few over the years).  Someone left a fancy pair of Bose active earbuds at my house once and I ended up using them one day out of curiosity.  I could hardly tell the difference. Connecting to bluetooth on the Senso is just a matter of holding the button in for a few seconds, and the same goes for turning it off.  As mentioned, I only use these for activities and they never fall out of my ears, even if I get pretty sweaty. The fit quite comfortably. Highly recommended if you're looking for decent workout earphones for exercise and don't want to spend big bucks for a fancier brand that might only be a tad bit better.

Awesome for most!


These headphones are an incredible value! They sound great and work pretty well. My main struggle with these types of headphones is that they don't stay in my ears very well.The rubber that wraps around the ears isn't very stiff so for people who already struggle with the rubber type of earbuds are going to continue to struggle. The wrap around piece keeps it in the general location, but isn't stiff enough to hold it in the ear canal. As a result, when I'm running, I'm constantly pushing these things deeper into my ear. Without an airtight seal in my ear, the bass goes to crap and I go from listening to booming Lindsey Sterling to something out of a Super NES game...I give my genes 1 star for giving me crappy ear canals, I can't blame the company for that. I just wish the wrap around portion was stiffer to hold it in better.

Poor Quality Sound with the SENSO


The sound quality is very bad.The instruments are all smashing along in the same bass range, meaning the music sounds dull and muffled. There is so much difference in sound quality compared to another Bluetooth headphone I use. I am considering sending these back.Edit: To clarify; I would say the audio is slightly better than that heard from earbuds you'd purchase at Five Below. There seems to be slight distortion in much of the audio (presumably from the ""deep bass"" advertised). There also seems to be lack of ""crystal clear treble"". In fact, I would not call anything about them ""crystal clear"" as they sound slightly muffled, like they are being played into a pillow. I tried pairing them with multiple devices (in case it was the device and not the product itself), but the audio was the same across different songs of different genres. I'd say these are barely worth $15, let alone the ""on sale"" $36.97 or the ""original"" $169.99. (Star deducted for asking price). Please note that I also attempted the ""factory reset"" with little to no improvement in audio quality.

Quality wireless earphones


I've really enjoyed using these while running during the last few months. I'm pleased with the sound quality and ease of use, and I rather like having the wire connection between ear pieces because if I need to take them out, I just drape them over my neck until I resume my listening. They've lived up to their water proof claim, too: I was caught in a torrential downpour a little while back and my personal soundtrack continued on just fine. My small notes: 1. Even with everything snugly secure in and around each ear, they do feel slightly loose. This lets outside noise in, but for me I'm glad to be more aware of my surroundings. 2. The audio warning that the battery is low comes on maybe five minutes before the battery runs out (at least at my volume level) so occasionally they've died while I'm mid-run. So I try to charge them after three hours of use so I'm not left without my tunes later. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the battery life. It can be easy to lose track of the total usage time per charge, so it would be nice to have an earlier warning. Overall: they're a solid and budget friendly set that I'm quite happy with.

Not a bad product, while it worked


I got these for my wife in January 2018 and she loved them. Would use primarily at the gym while paired to her Galaxy S7/S8 and perform considerably well for her needs. But after a more-than-usual sweaty workout about 1 week ago, she plugged the headphones in to charge but returned to them not turning on at all. We made sure they were fully dry and left them to charge longer than usual with no luck. These wireless headphones were supposed to be IPX7 waterproof so I'm not sure if the problem was due to the moisture or some other electronic failure. The reason I won't give a rating less than 3 stars is due to the fact that these things worked very well considering the price. I'm really disappointed because I didn't expect them to fail after only 10 months of use.

Take a Chance; These are Totally Worth It!!


Ok, so like many other people on here, I have tried everything. I settled on a pair of Beats that my husband  bought for my birthday. That was January 2016 and I was a casual user. Fast forward to April 2017, and I started training for a few 5Ks I wanted to do in the summer. After 1 month of hitting the gym 5-6 days a week the Beats stopped charging. Since they were out of warranty, nothing short of throwing $$ away could help them. So, I came to Amazon. This is where the thousands of reviews on this item helped me make my decision to buy these headphones.When they arrived I was stoked and threw them in my gym bag for the morning. Completely not thinking about charging them. I got the gym and prayed they would work and luckily, they turned on and paired. It would be two full weeks of gym use before I needed to charge them!!! This is straight out of the box!! Since then I have used them almost every day and through about 6 different 5K races! They stay in my ears, don’t bother me with my glasses, have kick ass sound and were $30!! I was blown away by how much better they are than the Beats that were about 5 times more money. Take a chance and get these!!

Great Headphone, good quality with mobile phone, not that good with laptop.


They are pretty awesome for the price. They are easy to pair, good Bluetooth connection, small, comfortable, lightweight. I pair it with my iPhone and it's working perfectly, however, I pair it with my laptop and every time I'm listening to an audio (from a video or from iTunes) there is a buzzing behind the music. If I pause the song or video it will become louder. I will only stop when I close the app or change the video web page. I don't know if this has to do with my laptop settings or the headphones but it's driving me crazy. That's the only reason I gave it 3/5 stars.--------UPDATE ------I'm starting to hate this buzzing noise behind the music, I need to have the music very loud for not noticing the buzz. Next step is to return them. I have another Premium quality headphones and I don't get this buzzing, maybe this one is way too cheap for my taste.

Excellent product for the price


I wear these headphones when running and am very pleased.  Sound quality is great, noise canceling is good, pleased with the battery life.  They stay in your ears when running, if you are on the treadmill you can hardly hear the belt.  I use them with a 7th gen iPod nano and they sync quickly.  Ive tried them with other devices and they have no problem syncing.  Had them on the other day and left our workout room in the basement and went upstairs and noticed they started to cut out when I was on the patio, then I realized I left the nano downstairs: These things are awesome for the price!  I can't understand why anyone would buy one of the high priced sets like beats, other then they want to show off.

All around a fair quality for the price.


I've bought several of these over the last year. It seems that each one lasts at least a few months before issues arise, but that's nothing new for earphones, at least in my experience. The sound quality is great, and it fits comfortably in my ear. The package comes with different-sized earbuds, so anyone concerned by that should rest assured; it is possible to change them out for comfort. The battery life is about 10-12  hours on average which is nice. The range is around 8 feet if the right earbud(where the signal is received) is pointing to whatever the Bluetooth is connected to such as your pc, phone, etc. If not, the signal will cut out fairly quickly which can get annoying. Another thing that may not annoy you, but it certainly did me, is the part that loops around your ears. It gets old fast, and the earbuds stay in your ears regardless of the loops being there or not so I always decide to cut them off. As far as I'm aware it does not damage them in any way, and I certainly have never seen a reduction in listening quality because of it.

Comfortable, and good sound, but signal distorts easily. Melted charge port


Comfort is excellent and the sound is good. The challenge I have is that I am experiencing signal distortion whenever my exercises (ex: leg stretches, phone in my pocket) put more of my physical body in the way of the direct signal line. For reference, I am about 6’1” and 200lbs. Once I straighten up, the signal strength restores and sound quality is great. Due to this experience, I am convinced that the published distance between device and headphones is drastically overstated.I wish there was a way to send the signal from the headphones to the phone that would skip the song. Currently, I can stop/start the song and adjust volume, but must pull out my phone in order to skip the song.Update: the charge port overheated and melted the plastic frame. Now the charger cannot fit back in to continue charging.

well priced buds for running


these are the best headphones I've used for running to date.  I previously used wired variants ( Bose & Monster earbuds, Klipsch on ears).  and the Sensos by far are best suited for this purpose.  when paired with the comply tips, the headphones provide a snug fit and a decent seal.  the sound quality is clear with more pronounced highs than lows (but this could be ameliorated by using larger comply tips).  the volume output is robust as well and often find myself lowering the volume from the default setting.  there is some occasional static when adjusting the earbuds for better fit  or when controlling the music app (Spotify in my case) while running but this could be caused by sporadic Bluetooth signal while being outdoors.  these are well priced headphones with high build quality which I hope will contribute to its durability.

Not sure how they could sell these for $170.00 but at the current($37) price point they're a great deal! First, the audio is pretty good, the sound is nice and clear also they can get quite loud if you need them to, the bass is fairly decent. The range is also a plus from my old ones I can leave my phone on one side of the gym and they still come in. (decent size gym) the case that they come in is a wonderful added bonus and the looks of the headset and the function are nice. So now the flaws first which I am most disappointed in and I took a star from it is the rubber things that go around your ears they hardly help, I wish they were a little stiffer they're soft and doesn't feel like they help all that much keeping them there. I mean on the other side they aren't hurting your ears if you have em in your ears for long periods of time which I don't really. But they don't slip out that easily they do feel slightly lose tho maybe just cause of my ears and other people might not have this problem but I seem to. I can't question the durability of these since I just got them but they do seem like they'll last unless the have some hardware problems down the road which I'll update if so. So yeah overall no regrets getting these and what everyone has been saying is pretty much on par.

Would not buy again


Have been using these earphones for 4 months, primarily during workouts.  Sound is decent, however I've had 3 issues:  1)  Battery charge doesn't last longer than 2 45-60 minute workouts.  Have to recharge to frequently.  2)  When connecting bluetooth, 50% of the time it does not connect and you have to go into Android connection settings to turn on ""Media audio"" which randomly turns itself off.  Not sure if it's an Android issue or an earphone issue, it doesn't matter to me which one it is because it's a pain.  3)  The cord connecting the two ear pieces is a little too short and rigid.  Because it's so rigid, if you turn your head, it doesn't gently rest at the base of your neck, but gets turned around and hangs awkwardly on one side, or pointing up at the back of your head.  UPDATE:  Since writing this review 3-4 weeks ago, the volume up/down button is broken.  The volume is stuck on low with no way to increase it due to the broken button.  I revised down from 2 stars down to 1.

They worked great, while they were working.


Have had mine for a year, treated gently, and not very often.  But last night, the left side started going out.  It would crackle and intermittently go on and off depending how i moved it around.  From experimenting, it appears the problem originates where the wire comes out of the right side to go to the left.  Holding the right earbud and moving it around a little would cause the left earbud to come on and go off intermittently.  I really liked these, but am definitely let down by the fact that with the little amount of use, and treating them gently over the last year that I've had them, that they would stop working properly.  It's possible that this pair somehow slipped past quality control.  I don't think I've ever had a pair of bluetooth headphones that broke down after one year, because as I've stated, I've always treated my gear very carefully and gently.  I have been using these headphones for 3-4 hours, one day a week (Fridays) for online gaming and that's it.

Good for music, not for using as bluetooth


I work outside and was looking for a headphone that would allow me to be handsfree when recieving phone calls, this is not the headphone you want to purchase if you are looking to use it primarily as a handsfree Bluetooth headphone for phone calls. The microphone picks up too much background noise and the other caller will not be able to head you if there is any noises around you, this includes wind noise on trip in your vehicle. I took the risk when purchasing because there weren’t many reviews on people who used it for phone calls but after having them for a month I could firmly say they are not beneficial to have for using to talk on the phone via Bluetooth. As for listening to music, they work pretty well, nothing spectacular but they work well. I will say however, the company provides some pretty great extras which is keeping me from returning the item because it’s too good of a value for decent music listening headphones. I would recommend these headphone if you are looking to Only use them for listening to music..

Great!..until it the sound from the left ear starts to cut in and out


Brought this on 03-2017, originally was very impressed with it's sound quality and battery life (only charge it about once a week or until the battery dies on me) and it stays securely and comfortably on the ear. Definitely a 5 star worthy product, one major issue and a minor one prevents it from getting a 5 star. The minor issue is that when you're in an area with many Bluetooth users (aka a busy gym) you will most definitely will experience interference.The one major issue with these is that the longevity, what I mean by that is I've had these headphones for a year and seven months and the left side is starting to go. Now you can believe me or not, but I make sure to take care of all my electronics (Never once expose them to extreme temp. (sauna/steam) or water, and with these I kept them in the case that was provided when not in use. So I am definitely disappointed with these, since they only lasted me a year and some change.

high expeditions but failed...several issues


OK, where do I start? I read all the reviews which prompted me to purchase this set.  initial use I found the headset lacked bass response. I contacted the company and they asked me to do a reset.  The reset seemed to address the bass somewhat to an acceptable level.  I tried using these in the evening to sleep with and found that the blue blinking power light was bright enough to notice it in a darkened room.  The only workaround I discovered was got place a small piece of electrical tape over this light. The final issue that forced me to return these was that several times after powering these onI would press the play button on the headset and the music would simple come out of the iPhone and not the headset.  The headset buttons were controlling the volume and pause the music coming out of the iphone speaker no sound was coming out of the headset.  Maybe I received a faulty set?  especially since there seems to be some many good reviews.  But this has been my experience.

I have personally bought 6 pairs and the last two were duds and they aren't honoring the warranty


Look I know I can be hard on my headphones it's why I went with bluetooth headphones in the first place wires are my nemesis. When my first pair broke I knew it was my fault. Then I lost the second pair, I still have the third pair and they work, gifted the fourth, however the last two who boy. The fifth and sixth pairs both broke in the exact same way. They just stopped charging. I have told so many people about these headphones. I can't believe I did. The fact that the warranty is a joke and they keep telling me I need to reset them. Sorry that doesn't work they won't turn on or charge anymore. I won't be rebuying or telling people about them again. At least not until they can figure out how to actually make their warranty worth it. Ordered May 2018, broken by September 2018; ordered October 2018 broken by January 2019 lasted less than 6 months for each pair.

Tinny sound and uncomfortable, non-adjustable ear hooks- RETURNED


I had another pair of Sensos for about 5 years until they recently stopped taking a charge.  They were never GREAT, but they were cheap and adequate for listening to music or podcasts while working around the house. The old pair also had flexible adjustable ear hooks that I could bend and mold to fit more comfortable over my ears.So, I came back to this product page (which helpfully informed me I had bought the same product 5 years previously) and ordered a new pair to replace the dead ones. The product I received was NOT the same as the one I was replacing.The earpieces are fixed, no longer bendable.  The sound is incredibly tinny and a bit crackly.  The earpieces feel considerably lighter and generally cheaper.I sent them back a few days after receiving them, so I can't speak to their battery life or charging time. At least the return process was painless (brought them to Khol's) and I was refunded the same day I dropped them off.

Good sound quality and quite comfortable


These little bluetooth over the ear headphones are great. They have an impressive range, and still work with clear reception when my phone is downstairs and I am upstairs. They're quite comfortable in ear, and the grip around the ear is soft and very flexible to keep the earphones in place. The sound quality is great, very clear, but not fully noise cancelling. For me, as every day headphones, this is totally fine. For an airplane or a loud situation, I'd probably still opt for higher end headphones (bose, etc), but these are very good for day to day stuff. They stay in place, don't shift around, and all of the controls are easily on the headphones, so you can turn them on/off, adjust the volume, etc. without having to touch your phone. For the price, these are great, comfortable headphones for blue tooth enabled devices.

Don't waste your money.


These are awful.  Don't waste your money.  They are easy enough to use and set up but the quality is awful.  The range is also terrible.  If you are standing 1 foot from the phone in direct line of site and standing still you get a clear signal.  Turn your head and the sound skips, pick up the phone and the sound skips, put it in you pocket and it skips.  Forget about exercise.  I can't speak to the battery life as I could only muster 2 runs before I returned them.

Insecure fit and signal interference


These head phones had great sound as well as packaging but a few problems were so overwhelming that I ended up returning them within a week.1) Would not remain in my earsThis was the main problem. For the life of me I could not keep these to remain in my ears during workouts. They remained in walking but any vigorous movements would progressively dislodge them (within minutes) until they eventually would fall out. I tried all the extra ear plug inserts but none worked. If the component that wrapped around the ears was more rigid, it possibly could have prevented this.2) Interference in signalWhen using these headphones around the gym, I suffered from varying levels of interference where there was quick signal breaks, while the phone remain paired with the headphones. This happened well within the Bluetooth range (under 5ft). I believe this interference was due to other Bluetooth devices because in a room without any other devices would remain connected without problems. I had not experienced these problems as severe before with other blue headphones. If this was the only problem I would still be satisfied with the product.Reading the other reviews it appears that I am an outlier with the fitting problem. As far as I know my ears are normally sized but for some reason these headphones unfortunately would not work for me.

Excellent value for the $$$


Originally I had bought a lightning connector adaptor to use my earbuds with my iPhone XR, during workouts at the gym the cord was just a hassle and I decided I would look into some inexpensive wireless blue tooth headphone options. Did not want to invest a crazy amount for what were going to be basically gym wear and found the SENSO's got good ratings and for the price $20.00 bucks I took a chance. I got the red one's and they have very good sound, great battery life and easy to use buttons to control volume, skip songs and have been a pleasant surprise and I recommend these for a alternative to the higher priced ones if your looking for something for the gym that won't fall out, hold in place on the tread mill or while lifting these won't let you down.

Good Headphones GREAT Customer Service


The headphones are pretty good and just what I expected.  What was surprising however, was the customer service I received after the sale.  After about 6 months of every day use during exercise, the SENSO headphones failed to power up.  Without much hope, I sent an email to Invotek on a Sunday morning to let them know they stopped working.  To my surprise, I received an email a few hours later (on a Sunday) with a few things to try in order to repair the headphones (essentially a factory reset).  I was able to get around to trying that on Monday morning and unfortunately that did not work so I emailed again to let Invotek know.  They responded again extremely quickly and notified me an order for a replacement set had been processed and was on its way.  For the price paid for the headphones I was happy with the product.  I am blown away by the customer service though and will certainly recommend them as a company that stands behind their product.  Get these headphones, you will love them for exercise and every day use.  You will have piece of mind knowing that if something should go wrong, the manufacturer will be there for you.

Amazing headphones


I was looking for a pair of headphones that  1) Fit my tiny, child-size ears without falling out and being uncomfortable to wear.  2) Wireless, that could be used with all of my devices so I didn't have to carry multiple wired sets depending on the device(s) when I travel.  3) Have decent sound quality. (I wasn't looking for perfection, just something that didn't sound tinny or scratchy.)  4) I didn't want on-ear or over-the-ear full headphones that are bulky.  5) I wanted a pair with a built-in mic.Results:  1) They actually fit snugly and fairly comfortably. So far, they haven't fallen out but I haven't used them while exercising.  2) You can actually pair with 2 Bluetooth devices at the same time but only 1 device can play music or phone calls with the headphones at any time.  3) Sound is awesome. Because of the snug fit, most ambient noises are not heard. This isn't true noise cancelling but it's a close second.  4) With the over ear loops (which are a bit large for my tiny ears) and the angle at which the buds are attached to the over the ear loops, they are significantly larger than the plain in-ear earbuds but they are still small and the two together help to create a good fit. I wear glasses and the loops fit outside the legs of the glasses just fine.  5) I tested the mic on a phone call by putting the phone down in one room after making a call and moving to another room about 40 ft. away. The person on the other end said I could be heard clearly although it sounded like I was talking in a tunnel.Cons:  1) Pairing isn't always instantaneous. It can require multiple tries on every device.  2) The constant flashing light to indicate what mode the headset is in can be very annoying. I can foresee passengers on an airplane sitting next to you getting a bit peeved if using these on red-eye flights. While watching a movie on my iPad, the blue flashing light every 5 seconds to show that the headphones were paired to my device reflected on my glasses. (Why is there a need to show it's paired when I am already hearing sound through them? Obviously, they are paired. And there is an audible ""Power On, Connected"" and ""Power Off, Disconnected"" announcement whenever each event occurs.) My plan for this is to put a sticky paper dot over the light. This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.Bonus:  1) All the goodies that came with the headphones: 2 USB cords, 2 wire ties, a car charger, extra earbud tips in various sizes and a small zippered hard shell carrying case.  3) For the price these headphones are outstanding. They were about half the price of a wired pair of in-ear buds I purchased from a touted company that didn't fit as well, became uncomfortable after about 1 hour and worked their way out of my ear. And, no extra goodies, except for the standard set of earbud tips.NOTE: The first time I used them, I wore them for 3 hours and the charge did not run out. They did get a little uncomfortable but adjusting the angle helped.

If you need something that won't fall out of your ears


Pros:1. Won't fall out of your ear when you're active like Apple Airbuds.2. Sound quality is good, but I'm not an expert audiophile. I use them mostly for audiobooks.3. Easy to pair to iPhone (after paired first time).4. Volume controls work well, as well as on/off.5. Has a case for the buds, although it could have been slightly larger. As it is, it fits into pocket or purse easily.Cons:1. Sometimes won't cling to the ear right away. The ear-hangers are malleable so you can get a grip.2. Everything is black, so don't think of setting these up in a dark room.3. Will work best line-of-sight. Mine would not work well in another room from source.

Treasure to Trash


Since 2017, I have purchased nine of these Senso headphones. (Yes, I can back that up with my purchase history.)  I purchased so many because they've been durable and at a really great price so I recommended them to family members.  Something has changed in the manufacturing and these went from treasure to trash.  As soon as I opened my most recent order, I noticed that these headphones were ""lighter"" and not as solid as the ones I've gotten earlier.  I use the headphones often for running.  These headphones seem to ""skip"" the music every 20 seconds or so.  Really annoying. Based on moderate testing, it's because I'm swinging my arms when I run.  If I stay still or bring my iwatch closer to my head, it helps.  It's a real shame and I'm going to have to look for something else from now on.

Worst portable speakers ever


PRO - You get some free completely unrelated crap with these headphones: card wallet (w/ adhesive to attach to phone case), extra ear plugs of various sizes and materials, and some car vent mounting accessories but none of that matters because that's not what you're looking for are you? You're looking for headphones, but whatever. Everyone loves free crap even if you probably would never want to be seen with said crap.CON - The ear loops are made of play dough or something as you'll be constantly fixing them as you move around. Same with the cable management ""buttons"" that are just a little softer than the ear buds themselves. It takes very little effort for the everything to become loose and useless. What good are headphones if you can't keep them on?TL;DR - The loops are made of cooked spaghetti and the cable management is held together by hopes and dreams. Buy these if you don't plan on actually wearing them.

Excellent times 3


Not too many years ago, I purchased a set of highly rated, ""state of the art"" and expensive wire connected in-ear head phones. They were quite good.When I purchased these Ivotek wireless SENSO Bluetooth Headphones  for my wife who listens to music with her iphone while at the gym or at home, I didn't expect they would be as good as my older ""state of the art"" wire connected earphones. I was wrong. These Senso Bluetooth wireless headphones sound just as good and are better in terms of comfort and convenience....and they are less than 1/5 the cost of the  highly rated, ""state of the art "" headphones  I purchased a few years ago.Of note too,  is that the owners of this product have followed up this purchase with an email to be sure I am completely satisfied. If I am not satisfied or am having problems, I can respond directly to the email or call  the provided telephone number.  A very good product at a very good price and dedicated customer service rates 5 stars.

Great Running Earbuds, But Sound Needs Customizing


For $35, these Bluetooth earbuds are a decent buy.PROS:- Easy to connect to your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device or computer.- They won't fall out of your ears while running.- Comfortable to wear.- No excess noises when running (like footsteps), blocks out noise somewhat well.- Easy to turn on and off, and change songs / volume / pause music.- They come with a ton of accessories including charging cable, other earbud inserts, carry case, car charger.CONS:- Sound: The main con for me, an avid music listener, is that they don't sound optimal and crisp at first. There is too much muddy bass on these and musician vocals are too low. However, you can fix this! Tweaking some sound options on your phone Equalizer in settings, or using an Equalizer program on your Mac will let you get a great sound out of these. They have potential, but it takes a little work to make it sound nice. But if you're someone who doesn't need perfect-sounding music, then consider these 4/5 star earbuds.- Apparently the battery life isn't extremely long on these, so just charge them when you go to bed after heavy use. But if you use it for an hour a day, like me, you won't even tell.- I'm personally not a fan of the 'shape-molding' ear inserts, so I replaced them with the rubber inserts from the AmazonBasics earbuds, perfect fit.Overall, 3/5 Stars Earbuds

Returned, but may work for others


I unfortunately had to return this headphone. Even though I returned it, I give it 3 stars because I want to be fair in my review.POSITIVES- Excellent sound quality- Proper fit (left ear bud) really cancelled out noise- Proper fit (left ear bud) was very comfortable- Easy pairing with my iPhone 6 plusNEGATIVES- Over the ear hanger would not stay in place (I have very small ears)- Improper fit (right ear bud) resulted in the earbud popping out- Improper fit (right ear bud) was very uncomfortable that it caused painThe improper fit of right ear bud may be just my ear. The left ear bud fit perfectly that I wonder if my left ear canal is just a tad tinier. ?? I think some people, like myself, just can't wear these types of ear buds. For me, the Apple type ear buds sit nicely inside my ears -- no pain. Otherwise, if you can wear this type of ear bud, it is exceptional.

Updated Review at 3 years--


This is my update. This product offers excellent price-performance-reliability for earplugs, especially at this price-point. I have had mine for 3 years and are going strong.  The one ding is that the shelf life of a charge is not very long.  So, I charge mine overnight and they are ready to use in the a.m.. 4+ hours of constant listening.  Enjoy!Original Review;  This product would be 5-star as far as I can tell in the few days I have used them.  Very easy to set up with two devices and the instructions are very well written to be operational in a few minutes. The sound quality is great and the noise canceling is great on a plane as well.  My only issue is the lack of low volume control.  The lowest setting on my old APPLE wired headset is perfect in a quiet environment.  SENSO lowest volume setting, iPhone X is also set at the lowest setting, the unit is still too loud in a quiet environment. I will do another airline trip with them because this is the best value for sure!

For the price, who’d dare complain?!?!?


It’s amazing that you reached out personally. The verdict is still out but, I can tell you that these headphones have beat out 80% of the ones I have tried lately. On the hunt for that perfect pair (for me). That includes fit, sound, and durability.  Fit I give a solid A/A-, sound=B+ and too soon to say about build but initially I’d say it’s pretty good but I’m very careful. For the price I have to say an overall A. I am just need that solid sound and I can’t say I feel that just yet. But they will stay in my collection at the top of my choices. If you have any new ones you have developed, I’d love to give them a try. Let me know what you recommend. I’m ordering a new pair today of another brand to compare.Your approach to customer satisfaction is bar none!!

Absolutely fantastic and super cheap


I used to own a pair of $90ish bluetooth headphones, and I loved everything about them with the one exception of the troubles with talking to people over the phone. One day they broke and I couldn't afford new ones, so I looked for cheaper ones and these were the best rated for the best price. They absolutely live up. It's easy to talk over the phone which is a fantastic addition to my life, the range they have from my phone is really really good (10 or 20 feet maybe?), and the sound quality is prestine. I did add little plastic things to fit them inside my ear to keep it from moving around (I have no idea what that thing would be called), but these things are fantastic and very affordable. The battery life is pretty good, I'm not sure exactly how long it lasts but it gets me through a couple days generally. I wish that it was easier to find out how much battery was left before the annoying ""BATTERY LOW""  constantly going off in my ear, but I've more or less figured that out.

Great workout solution to so many problems


I have particularly small ears and always struggle with ear buds no matter the sizes offered. I needed earbuds for cycling and long distance workouts. I also needed Bluetooth because cords pulled my earphones out no matter what. Sound quality was a factor but not first priority...until I got these Senso headphones! Sound is amazing and the Bluetooth range is phenomenal- trying them out, I can walk all over my house without disruption. The headphones stay on well so far but it’s winter so I am only using trainer for rides. For is great so far, though it took some adjusting to make secure. I have high hopes for these headphones! Better than any I have tried and the price makes the trial well with it! Shipping was faster than expected and the case is great size for in my bag & won’t lose them. Extras are fantastic and so appreciated. One charge has lasted three days so far w about 4 hrs of use.Seller was fantastic and easy to order from, packaging was secure and I had nothing but good experience with this Seller and product!

Great headphones for the price and customer service is super


Probably doesn't get any better than this for price + quality. I sweat a lot, especially when I run and living in the south. These don't ""wick"" any moisture from my sweaty ears and I'm often pulling them out and wiping them when I can because they slide around when they get sweaty. I wear a hat now when I run so that helps. They cancel noise pretty well, except for the wind ""whooshing"" sound you can sometimes have on a windy day. The sound quality is superb. These aren't Bose or Apple headphones, but I was blown away by how deep and clean the sound was for how much they cost. You're also not paying Bose or Apple prices. Plus, if you're using these to workout/run, you don't need the crispest sound--at least I don't and I'm very picky about audio and headphones.One other thing: My headphones actually stopped charging about a month after buying them. I tried manual restarts and different chargers--everything. So, I contact customer support and within hours they responded, and within days they had shipped me a new pair of headphones that, so far, are working fine. Just be sure to register your headphones on their website.

Reasonably Priced, Reasonable Quality Wireless Headphones


I have enjoyed using these headphones. Obviously, they are not the best, but they are definitely a set of reasonably priced, wireless headphones that function well for the average user.Pros+ Connect to multiple devices without issue.+ Clearly displayed when on and connected.+ Easy to use, turn on, and connect to a new device.+ Decent battery life.+ Decent microphone.+ Comfortable! Have had no issues with either the earpieces or the over-ear loops being uncomfortable.Cons- Soft buzz/white noise in the earpiece. For me, it is in the left earpiece. If they are turned on, but no music is being played, it is not there. However, as soon as I hit play (when connected to any device) there is a constant white noise that is quite noticeable, especially when music is quite or in between songs. This is the most annoying aspect, but I tend to eventually block it out and ignore it.- Band that connects the two earpieces takes getting used to and breaking in. It is a material that catches if you turn your head. For example, if I turn to the left, it will often grip my shirt and I feel the cord pull on the right side. It has not yanked out (due to over-ear loop), but can be annoying because I have to reposition it each time.For the average user seeking a pair of wireless headphones for exercise or regular portable use, while also not wanting to spend $50+, I would recommend these headphones - they get the job done.

Had high hopes this would be a great bluetooth headset but it failed.It's supposed to reach 30 feet, but all I could get out of it was 3 feet and then it would get choppy and sometimes even lose connection.  I made sure everything was fully charged.  Reset to factory settings, re-paired with device, still the exact same problem.  Tried multiple times (with multiple devices) following the reset re-pair instructions but it did not help.  Clearly defective.I tried jogging with them and the sound of wind was not cancelled out at all, so not that impressed with the sound canceling claim either.2-star for decent sound and a good price - it would be great if it actually worked as they claimed.

Fantastic sound but needs work on comfort


SOUND AND NOISE CANCELING: The sound is amazing. As a bass head and a person who listens to bass heavy music. The bass is kicking and vocals are clear. Not the best but its good. Noise canceling is pretty good as well. I use these when I go to the gym and they work seamlessly. I don't hear guys grunting and screaming when they lift weights or them talking about protein shakes etc. It all goes away and its wonderfulFIT: However... the fit is not as great. Its too harsh and really stiff. I tried different earpieces the box gave me but it still felt hard and uncomfortable. It really needs some work. The earpieces feel too solid and it pushes against my ears way too hard.KIT: This things comes with 2 cables (iphone and android), a carrying case, car charger and ear pieces and wire ties. Its pretty loaded with stuff and its helpful.OVERALL: Great set of headphones sound and noise canceling wise, I was very bummed it was not as comfortable as I hoped it would be.

Wasted Money


I bought these to listen to audiobooks on my Kindle so audiophile sound quality was not my goal.  Good thing too since music production was mediocre at best.  I chose these because they were the ""recommended"" earbuds by Amazon for the Kindle.  Bad on you, Amazon.  When rating the stars I was unable to evaluate the noise cancellation, if any, because they were so ill-fitting and uncomfortable I could not wear them for any length of time ...ditto for moisture-wicking.  They were not worn long enough for moisture to accumulate.  I too am suspicious of the 5 star reviews.  I am currently in possession of MANY different brands and styles of headphones and earbuds.  While these are not the worst I have encountered, they are definitely in the bottom 3.  Look elsewhere.

Very nice product


Construction quality is superb; the operable buttons are well placed and mechanically feel good. Ear fit is good and intuitive, and probably appropriate for most (perhaps all) ears, given the simple design and the accommodating ear hook. Three sizes of plugs for the ear canal as well as foam plugs come with the device, and all are of good quality. Pairing with an older Macbook Air containing a USB Bluetooth dongle for the current Bluetooth protocol was seamless. Sound quality is more or less comparable to that of the wired sports model from the maker best known for noise cancellation headphones. Senso has better bass, no doubt because they fit closer (and comfortably) to the ear canal, and was one of the reasons I made the purchase, since these are designed to fit into the ear canal (whereas my other sports earphones are designed to sit adjacent to ear canal entry and thereby bass response and overall immersiveness is diminished).  In contrast, the treble range seems to have a bit of harshness to it; this comparison is made while sitting in a quiet room and simply listening to the headphones. Based on my experience with a pair of audiophile-level in-ear monitors that sound terrible if the plugs are not fully seated in the ear canal but exceptional when seated properly, it is possible that working toward a better fit with the plugs will improve the treble range quality. So far, I have only used the default pair of plugs, and my ear canals are approximately average in size -- but shape must also be considered.  In terms of sound quality rating and as comparison, I have high-end magnaplanar open headphones with matched external DAC and headphone amplifier, which would net 4.5 stars -- as there are always areas in which earphones can be improved.  Four stars for the Senso represents very good (and probably the highest that such a device would be rated by me) for what is a relatively low-end audio transducer.  It is likely that while listening during physical activity -- the primary reason for my purpose -- the sound will be ""better"" though I have not had an opportunity to yet do that.  The noise cancellation feature was not tested.  Overall, the product (so far) is well-worth the Amazon price.  I was contacted twice by email from the company making sure that I had no problems with setup; impressive.

Convenient & Simple.


These are by far the best earphones/headphones/earbuds I’ve owned. I’ve never shelled out on Bose or Beats so I can’t tell you if these are better than those high end brands. But compared to the other earphones in the same price range, these take the cake. I bought these because my old earphones gave up on me because I use them to the gym and sweat on it a lot. I will probably add on to this review after a few weeks at the gym to see if anything changes. So far, at home, it’s been holding up well.I have small ears so the silicone ear hook doesn’t really hook on my ear but I haven’t had an issue with the earphones falling off.Functions are super simple/user friendly. There’s only three buttons. A volume up button, a volume down button, and a multifunction button. I find this great because as a gym goer, I hate accidentally pressing the wrong button and changing a song by accident while I’m in my zone. The volume buttons are at reach. Other Bluetooth earphones have their volume buttons and power on/off button on the wire, and a lot of people let the wire hang behind their neck rather than in front of them, having to put the volume up and down with those types is a hassle because you’d have to feel around for the buttons or take your earphones on and pull the controls in front of you. I’m glad these have the controls right on the ear part. Super convenient.The box includes three different silicone ear-tip sizes, 1 pair of foam ear tips (good for noise cancelling + conforms & fits many sizes), USB Cable, carrying case, wire ties, and additional things like a cellphone card wallet & car mount. I don’t have these pictures because I already used them.

Don't last


Updated Review: they just died in me after only 7 months of use. Battery won't hold a charge and keeps disconnecting from both phone and tablet that I've used the whole time. Unfortunate, because these were my favorite so far. Wish they lasted longer.Previous review:These are great! I recommend them. I've had them for months now. Use them daily at work. Hold at least 8 hr+ charge. Connect quickly. Sound quality is clear, crisp highs and deep full lows. Volume is powerful, sometimes have to lower volume because they are that loud. They stay in my ear and don't fall out. Work well with 2 devices at the same time. They work well at cancelling outside noise. Only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because sometimes on a call, I'm not heard clearly because the Mic picks up too much background noise. If I'm driving it's great, but in a public place not so much. I would purchase again, since I don't use them for calls, but for music and videos.

BROKEN PRODUCT


My wife has bought two of these headphones for me.  The first one a few years ago and used them religiously mowing grass and while working at my full time job.  The amount of battery life was good wished it was longer but they were good.  However the second set she bought me were horrible quality.  I think dollar tree has better wireless headphones.  First thing that happened when trying to switch the different ear bud size I popped the speaker off the headphone figured it was designed to do this to clean it better.  Should of been my first warning.  So I grab the included charger wire and plug it in no issue the light turns red.  However I noticed the light went out completely.  Checked the charger and it had completely broke inside the headphones making it now useless as it wouldn't even charge.  And to finish the icing the other ear piece came out completely to the point the wire stripped lose.  Absolutely garbage quality control.  She is sending it back for full refund and I supplied the 1 star review.  Guess it's time to find a better product.

CONTINUED LEFT SIDE PROBLEMS!!!


The perfect headphones in my eyes and my daughters.Well here it is just a few months after I purchased these headphones and they wont turn on now. My daughter is a little disappointed to say the least so make sure you buy a warranty if you do purchase these. They stepped right up and replaced them as soon as I contacted them. I'll keep updating as I go.Well just a short time later this pair of headphones also crackled out on the left side. In reading more reviews it seems to be a common problem. Now I have to return this defunct pair of headphones and be without for what is an obvious ongoing manufacturing problem. I know I am getting turned off more and more buying ""Amazons Choice's"" and not liking that I am paying to get taking advantage of.Here it is just a six months after the second replacement pair and they died. I spent 23 bucks for a pair off ebay 5 years ago that still work no problem....

Don't Buy if You Expect Warranty on This not so cheap Headphones


I purchased them to primarily use with my Apple Watch when on the go and honestly was very excited until I actually started using them. I will start from the beginning and support I have received. I am not the person to complain but really when I do I want to help others before you make a purchase.After finding the right earpiece thats both comfortable and doesn't fall out I found the two that fitted perfectly. Not until I actually went for a run and experienced that left headphone just kept slipping out of my ear and I was so annoyed by it and tried cleaning my ears, changing earpieces  - even wearing different sizes on both ears, but nothing it just kept popping out every time I went for a run.Ok, I got used to just adjusting them about every minute because the left one kept FALLING OUT of my ear (Yes, I actually got used to constantly fixing them). Then I ran into another issue and this time I DECIDED to contact support about their product. This issue was - left piece started to wearing out or fading out with losing that coating they are in.So, I contacted and their typical response is to try different earpieces and cleaning ears - sure, but comon ""do they think I haven't tried it all already?"" I was just so disappointed and tried to really think maybe my unit is defective because the issue happening only with left earpiece (1. falling out and 2. discoloration is happening).It gets betterYesterday all of a sudden they have completely lost the base and no longer usable, so here I am trying to share my experience with everybody because if you want or at least HOPE to get a replacement, then good luck to you and that warranty they come with, where did that go?!Also notice that this is just a headphone piece and there are many alike, they are just using the manufacture to put their branding which is ""Senso"" on them. You can find identical ones with different name, so beware.Avoid and instead spend some extra money to buy headphones with actual warranty

Best workout Bluetooth earbuds


Here’s what I can tell you: I’m what my friends and family consider a gym rat, and I love to run. I’ve had multiple headphones, ear buds, Bluetooth things, etc, but this is the only brand I’ve ordered multiple of. The last pair I lost during a 12 hour commute home (they fell out of my bag somewhere) and I cried. Literally. I was exhausted and delirious, but I still cried.It comes with all the components to make Bluetooth earbuds worth it. Multiple types of squishy things? Got it. Charger? Got it! Container to keep them safe (which I clearly forgot to use)? Got it. It even comes with a sleeve you can adhesively add to the back of you phone case, and it works WONDERFULLY. I’ve always been in love with this brand and it comes so highly recommended. Will it stop when you take them out of your ears? No. But they will withstand all the sweat, the tears, the anxiety, anger, and everything else you throw at them that other brands can’t. You won’t be disappointed.Also, I have a long term dating relationship with an audio engineer who says that they’re not bad for their sound quality either. “Great for a bargain” were among the phrases used.

Bad bluetooth makes these annoying


These headphones are decently comfortable (could fit my ears better but are fine) and have decent sound especially for the price, but the bluetooth connection is highly annoying.For starters, I'm pairing these with an iPhone 6s running iOS version 12.1.2. Pairing these is relatively easy, which is a good thing. With bluetooth turned on for your phone or iPad, you turn the headphones on my pressing and holding the main button on the right ear bud. They announce ""power on"" through the speakers, then you'll see them as an available bluetooth device on your phone. Push connect and they start working. Battery life is decent (lasts several jogs or long walks before needing another charge) and the sound quality is decent except in windy conditions.So what's the downside, especially for $30? Well, that's the first time you connect and pair the headphones with your device. The second time, the headphones pair automatically with your phone as you power up. Unfortunately, on the second and subsequent pairings, the bluetooth connection drops about every 5 seconds. There will be a soft beep, then the headphones go silent for 2-3 seconds, then another beep and they re-connect and resume playing. That keeps happening over and over. I found that to avoid consistently dropped bluetooth connections I have to go into my phone, find these headphones from my list of bluetooth devices, have my phone ""forget this device"", then re-pair the phone and headphones as if it was a brand new set of headphones. If I delete and re-initialize the headphones before every time I use the headphones, they work great. If I just turn the headphones on and go, they really suck.So... Maybe they work better with Android devices or phones newer than an iPhone 6s, or maybe the next iteration of iOS will fix this bug. I'd likely have given these 4 stars if they didn't have to be re-initialized every time I used them, but I can only give them a single star so long as this defect continues. In the end they work well, especially for the price, but they are super annoying.

Ok. Not great.


I'm a bit of an audiophile and a former hip hop producer, and while I did enjoy the deep bass, the treble just isn't there. I EQ'd while connected to my phone and computer and could never balance things out properly. The bass is so intense that it really muffles anything on the rest of the spectrum. I bought these so that I could listen to music and take a phone call as needed while at the office, but the mic quality is awful. I attempted to make a couple phone calls in my office at work and my home office and the audio was so poor that using them for calls simply wasn't an option. I returned them and purchased a similar item.The positives: they have great battery life. Although I didn't use them for long phone calls, I did listen to music on them for 7+ hours a day and found that the battery life on them was around 9 hours, which was more than I expected. They charge quick and are easy to use. The additional accessories were really nice to have, so I'm disappointed that I had to send them back.

Quality control issues


This is the 4th set of these headphones that I’ve bought, and until this one, I’ve been happy. This set has an on/off button that works only part time. Sometimes it turns on the first time, but sometimes it takes 10 or 15 tries, which is very annoying, and shouldn’t happen.  I’ve initiated a refund, and will order again to see if this is a one-time quality control issue, or if this is the case with all their headphones.

Bent USB charger


For now I will only rate it 3 stars because I just received it and don't know how is the sound quality, battery life an so on. I will for now give it that rating because as soon as I took them out of the package I started checking everything that came in the little box with this headphones, which I have to say I'm pleased. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the USB charger was slightly bent and couldn't plug it into my USB port. Since I bought two of this items, one for my husband as well, I compared them and his looks perfectly fine as you can see in the pictures. Other than that it looks pretty decent. Now I just have to put it to test when I workout. I will be coming back to rate it again.

Didn't Work For Me At All.


Hated everything about these headphones. The actual bud is rigidly fixed to a very clunky piece that looks funny on each side of your head. The angle of the ear bud didn't fit my ear, and became very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes of use. I tried my son's Beats sport headphones, and they fit extremely well, so the issue I had is with these specific headphones. I tried a variety of different rubber pieces to see if that would help, but there is really no solution for the pressure point issue on the inside of the ear. The clunky rigid case is then connected to a very soft rubber ear wrap. These headphones won't fall off of your head, but there is zero chance that the ear buds will stay in place. I was constantly pushing them back into position. The battery life was every bit of 8 hours, but the battery warning comes at the very end of life. I was five minutes into a 20 minute walk, when I got the first warning. Then the warning interrupted the book I was listening to every couple of minutes for the next 10 minutes, and then the head phones died. Even my older style Fitbit gives me a rough battery level. You would think that ear buds could give you an indication of battery level when you make the Bluetooth connection. And is there some reason why I need to be reminded every two minutes? The head phone performance was poor. I connected them to a brand new Samsung S8+, and with the phone in my pocket the sound would cut out every couple of minutes. Even the internal voice that says 'Power On' played poorly and had an amazing amount of hiss. I've used sport phones with the controls on the cord (basically just below chin level) and on the ear piece like these headphones. Personally, I prefer the controls on the cord, but that is a personal preference.  I'll be returning these headphones.

You get what you pay for - bad bluetooth tech


The only reason I am giving two stars and not one is because these are the first pair of in ear headphones that I've been able to run with and not have to constantly mess with them to keep them in my ears. That being said, they are worthless to have on a run because the bluetooth tech is not nearly good enough. Using these headphones reminded me of the day when you'd run with a discman and the music would just constantly skip. You'd try to hold it in a way so that it wouldn't skip as much, then you're paying more attention to the device than the music, run, or anything else. My first attempts were with the apple watch and those results were by far the worst. I ended up just taking the headphones out because they were just distracting with the skipping. I thought, ok maybe it's the combination of the watch and the headphones that they just don't have a strong enough signal, so I tried running with my phone. That did improve a bit, but it was still not good enough to continue using. I'm just passed the window for returning or I would. If you are going to run with bluetooth headphones, don't buy these.

DON'T BOTHER BUYING!!


I bought these wireless headphones a couple of months ago and I have been regretting it. Let me start by saying that I only use these once every week or so maybe every like 5 days, so I've only worn them less that 15 times total at this point.They are a total pain in the neck! I go for runs with them and one of the ear buds is ALWAYS FALLING OUT, even with the things that curl around your ears which SHOULD HELP keep them in, but barely do. Because I have had them for over a month now I don't have an option in my order history to return these for a refund.  (Keep in mind that when I had gotten to the 1 month mark I wore them maybe 5 times so at that point I didn't think it was that bad)The only nice thing I have to say about these is that the sound is good... But so what, I have 2 year old wired headphones that have great sound and they were less than $10. These are not worth $35 just for Bluetooth and good sound.  Unless your dieing for wireless headphones that are cheap, I would either get better ones that will be more expensive or stick with wired ones that are just as good for half the price.

Poor sound quality, bulky construction.


I ordered these headphones because they had lots of good reviews on Amazon. However once I received them I was disappointed with there overall product.What I liked:- they where only 20 bucks- they came with a nice storage caseWhat I disliked:- cheep bulky construction- poor noise canceling (if any)- horrible sound quality- no fine tunning volume adjustmentThe headphones where bulky and did not fit snuggly in my ear (even with the difference earpieces) they definitely we're not noise canceling.The sound was vary bass-y okay for pop or like Daddy Yanky but you didn't get a nice crisp sound. Also at higher volume it was very distorted.I was unable to make fine adjustment to the volume at lower volume. It was either way too loud or not loud enough.I will be returning them I'd trying something else.

FINALLY!!! The perfect pair of headphones!!


I've been an avid exerciser my whole life, both as a runner and a gym rat.  Nothing irks me more than having to stop and fiddle/fix my earbuds, much less have a pair that keep falling out.  The SENSO Bluetooth headphones not only sound great, but are comfortable and stay in place quite well.  They also have remote controls for power and sound control on the earpiece itself.  Syncing it with my phone was a snap and the charging port couldn't be more simple.  It comes with adapters to get the perfect fit inside your ear, but I didn't need them. Adjusting the outer hook was also easy. I also really appreciate the small case it comes with to protect my headphones in my gym bag when I'm not using them. You would think a product with  all these features would be so much more expensive, but for the quality at this price, there is no reason to spend more!

Broke after two weeks use - won't turn on, replacement pair melted while charging!


I purchased these for my son for a Christmas present.  I had owned a couple of pairs over the past few years so I thought they were pretty good.  He finally started to use them about three weeks ago.  They stopped turning on after two weeks use.  But, it was more than a month since I had purchased them (before Christmas) so I could not do an Amazon return.  Very disappointed in these.  I guess I am done purchasing this product.  I was going to update this review to mention that the seller replaced the headphones and was very responsive.  That is great.  However, the replacement headphones after a month, melted down (literally) while charging overnight!

The newer ones aren’t as good


I have bought this product numerous times over the course of two years. The product usually lasted 6 months until it fell apart but I tolerated it because the sound was so good for the price. Unfortunately that is no longer true. The newer earbuds have no bass compared to the older ones. I still have an older one (slightly falling apart but still functioning) went ahead and bought a new pair. And immediately I could tell a big difference in sound quality. I thought it was a fluke and bought another one. Nope the bass just sucks now the music sounds hollow without it. Definitely returning and no longer repurchasing.

Head phones were OK up until the first song with Bass played...


Big disappointment... I bought these headphones b/c the apple buds are really uncomfortable and I needed something that would tend to stay in my ears while being active. While bulky the earbuds were comfortable and for the most part stayed put while riding my bike which was a nice surprise. Things went downhill from there really quick as I noticed the sound quality was far from great.. the bass is absolutely dreadful. The speakers crack and distort with the slightest bit of bass and that's a real disappointment. These headphones are just about useless if it can't play music with reasonable sound quality. Will be requesting refund.I'm surprised by the 5 star reviews honestly... I read through a lot of them before buying but I'm starting to think that maybe these were fake reviews now.Don't buy this product if sound quality means anything to you.

... using these for about a week now and really like them. These are my first pair of wireless ...


Have been using these for about a week now and really like them.  These are my first pair of wireless headphones so I don't have much to compare to but comparing them to standard wired headphones, they're awesome.  It's SO much nicer not having to deal with the wire hanging between which bounces around annoyingly when jogging so you have to hold it or tugs and gets ripped out sometimes when lifting.  Loving not having to deal with that at all anymore.I like how these came in a hardshell case with several different ear bud piece sizes and car port charger.  The button functionality on the ear piece to modify volume, answer/end calls, pause music and etc. seems nice though haven't used it much.The only dislikes I've experienced so far is the wire between the ear pieces that goes behind the head seems like it could be shorter.  It's good, though, that they provide a little thing that you can feed the wires through to tighten it on the back of the head.  The first time I wore these jogging I wasn't wearing glasses and the right ear piece kept popping loose so ended up just taking it out and only using the left one.  The other times I've been wearing glasses which helps anchor the pieces.  Not holding much weight to this criticism right now given I'm not sure if I just didn't properly input that ear bud that time or what, but just wanted to be transparent with my views.

Stays Put, Bad Sound


These are the first wireless earbuds I've owned. I was looking for good earbuds that would stay in my ears while running or biking trails. They come with lots of extra accessories which you may find useful but the most important parts for me are the ear hooks and foam tips. The hooks are comfortable and keep your headphones where you put them, and the foam tips will prevent the muffled ""wire bouncing"" sound that you get with properly sealed silicone tips while running. The unfortunate thing is they don't sound good. It's as if everything you play through them is a YouTube video on the ""240"" setting. My daily earbuds are Skullcandy Titans which I've had for over 5 years and the sound quality on the these earbuds doesn't come close to those. SENSO got everything I wanted into these headphones except for good sound quality, which ultimately leaves me where I started: searching for good sounding workout headphones. Verdict: If all you're looking for are headphones that will stay put through a ""high impact"" workout, these are great for the price. However, if a noticeable lack of sound quality will distract you (like it does for me) I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

Great Product


I've been running for competition and health for over a decade but I never owned blue tooth headphones (you never miss what you never had, but now that I have it I'll never run without it). (1) Comfort: Excellent. I didn't even notice they were on. Easy to put on, and they never slip out or fall off. I never had to rearrange them as I almost always did with earbuds. (2) Sound: Excellent. The music I run to starts off with AC/DC's Hells Bells. The sound was crisper and clearer than any headphone before. The surround sound is excellent. I will say that at first I found the sound a bit light on the bass. It took a few miles to get used to it, but from then on the sound was perfect. I think I shoved my previous earbud in too tight. (3) Bluetooth: here is my one question. Several times in the course of an hour run, the sound would give out for 1/2 a second. I think I lost connection. Its not the music because I've ran to this playlist for months. Is it my iphone, or new headphones or some external interference? Don't know because I'm new to blue tooth devices.

Going on two weeks now...still working well.


Dispite their strange email to me to review their product only a day or two after I receiived it and obviously not enough time to review anything I'm now ready to give you / them a review on this product.After having used this product for a couple weeks now I do like this product. I use it driving to and from work listening to audio books or music in my car.Pros - Nice sound, easy to use audio controls and I think they are fairly comfortable to wear for an hour or so.Cons - Somewhat bulky and there is an obnoxious flashing LED light. My drive is in the early AM i.e. still dark out. This headset has an LED (light) that flashes every few seconds which throws off an annoying strob-light effect in my cab ""and"" bounces off the corner of my eye glasses. This is very annoying when driving. The fix? I put a little piece black electrical tape over the light. Much better now.As for the battery life, I'm only getting about 5.5hrs before I'm hearing the battery low alert from the headset (5 hrs is more than enough for me).Regardless of the cons I've mentioned. I would definitely recommend this product. Good price and after two weeks it's workiing well. Four instead fo five stars for the battery life discrepancy.

Fantastic sound. Easy set up. Volume button popped off.


These have been a great asset to my workouts with fantastic sound at the gym. I can block out the world (and other 5am people) around me, set my phone on the treadmill while it plays my music, and saves my spot, and walk away to do a 2 minute weight circuit and back again before the timer goes off on the treadmill. My only issue is that the volume control button popped off out in the dark parking lot one early morning when I was removing the buds from my ears. It was a lost cause trying to find it. I usually leave them around my neck while I walk out to my car so I don't tangle or cram them into something that will destroy them, hang them on my rear view mirror, and hang them on a hook in my bedroom. They still work with amazing sound, but I can't control the sound from the earbuds any more. It's not a big problem since I can still use my phone, but it would have been nice if the buttons would have stayed on.

Faulty charging cord-Non responsive warranty!!!


I like the headphones. I will give them 4 stars. It also comes with a very nifty cord that doubles as headphones charger and an iPhone charger. I love the idea, but the cord became faulty within a couple of weeks. I have been traveling for the last two months and this was my opportunity to write about it. Shame about the cord. The cord gets 1 star.After contacting Sensi several times, I have given up on them. They promised a replacement cord 3 times and I have never received it. Their comments below did not follow through with the mailing of the cord as promised. The headphones are worthless without a charging cord. Another product goes to the trash!!!August 12: Update: The replacement cord finally arrived after several months. Buyer beware!

I am very pleased with the quality of these speakers


I am very pleased with the quality of these speakers. These don't sound like low-end headphones at all when the price clearly states. They come with different sizes and style earplugs, my favorite was memory foam type. First time of my life I feel like headphones are holding gently to my ears and music quality does not change that much when I move around. I live quite active lifestyle and these are perfect for me. They wear them when I work, run... bike.. hike... they just good. If I have to name at least one downside then it would be battery. Everything else is pretty nifty!+ Pros:* amazing audio (smooth bass and clear trebs, no crackling or screaming menus, same pleasing experience as my old 200$ ones!)* reliable BT connection with iPhone (no hassle, fast one touch control, connects every time, no dropping)* ergonomically pleasing* great bang for the $$- Cons:* battery time (not horrible but I'm considering getting another pair to always have one charged, they die faster than most of my BT headphones)

No regrets


I am very satisfied with my Senso headphones. The sound quality is great, battery life is sufficient, and the comfort/fit is perfect. I recently had an issue where they stopped charging for some reason. I contacted customer service through Amazon and within two hours they sent me an email with steps that resolved the issue completely. I'm very impressed with their customer service and how they stand behind their product. My ONLY wish is that the ear loops had an ability to be shaped a bit to be more snug to my ears--but that's a very minor issue and doesn't affect the five star rating.7/5/17 UpdateI had an issue with connectivity about 30 minutes into a run yesterday. Once again, I contacted customer service and they responded within two hours. I was very very impressed. They walked me through how to do a factory reset. It was quick, easy, and resolved my issue thoroughly. I really love the quality of sound, ease of use, and customer service I've experienced with Invotek and their Senso headphones!

I am annoyed that I bought these again but the new paid actually great.


Aug 2019 Aupdate - - - -I bought another pair just because the value is hard to beat and I have to say these new ones work really well. The connection is great. Call quality brand new is very good, I am sure they will fail after a year of use like my first 2 pairs, but I think for the price you get the value you paid for.I use these to run several days a week, charging almost daily, and they work well.--------------Its my second time buying these headphones. My first pair had really good range. i could be over 100 ft away from my phone with no issues. These ones barely go 30feet which forces me to stay close to my phone at the gym.Update: 1 year on, the headphones are no longer staying connected to bluetooth, they disconnect quite a bit. They get dislodged from the earlobe pretty easily while running, which is very annoying. This happens even more often if you sweat

Best wireless head phones Ive ever owned


PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEWSo I'm purchasing my second pair today. Not because there was anything wrong with the first pair, I just rolled over them with my desk chair yesterday and although they still work, I had to glue a piece back on so I'd rather just go ahead and buy another pair. So the review, before these headphones I owned a pair of Bose, and 3 pair of Beats by dre... all of which broke or shorted out within 6 months of purchase. I use headphones primarily for the gym and I cycle to and from work. I am a VERY heavy sweater and that has been a major problem with other headphones ( BOSE, BEATS, Panasonic, ect) because the volume control and microphone  for those were on the cable connecting the two headphones so all of them ended up shorting out after a few months of use. With these the controls are on the side of the eadbud itself. I used these from the end of May 2017 until yesterday (Oct 3 2017) and I never had a single issue with them, EVER. the sound quality is as good as BOSE and the BEATS were. That is why I am buying a second pair.

Great sound but only lasted 3 months before they stopped working!!


UPDATED REVIEW:5-25-2017So like I said these headphones are the best out there!!!The Invotek sellers are super professional and they handled my issue with so much care.  I contacted them regarding the issue I had(read previous review)  and they immediately communicated back. They had kept communicating with me via email, walking me through a reset process of the headphones up until they sent me another pair.  I couldn't be any happier.  I honestly did not wana buy from another company because I have come to love these SENSO headphones that much!! I got my new replacement pair that they sent me and am listening to music right now as I write this review.  So if you are looking for Bluetooth headset, please stop looking and just go ahead and buy these ASAP!!!  You will that me later! 😊×*******************************************************************************************************************************●_●●_●●_●●_●●_●●_●●_●♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ These headphones are awesome. They have amazing sound,  they stay put in your ears and you won't feel them. Super comfy. I have had them for since February 2017. The reason I have them a 3 star is because as of yesterday  May 1st they just stopped working. I didn't drop them in water, I took great care of them. Used them everyday because am a very active woman.  Am very disappointed that they only lasted 3 months!  So now looking for a replacement 🙁🙁

Very good at this price


These are about as good as you can expect at this price point. I've never owned high-end bluetooth ear buds, but these sound good to me, and I learned an important lesson. My first pair (I received them as a gift) lasted about 1 year and then a short developed in the wire where it connected to the left ear. It occurred to me that this could happen to any brand when you throw this into the gym bag and cary them around unprotected. But even if you put them into their case every time, you're still folding and bending that wire. So it seems like more expensive brands would be subject to this and therefore a waste of money. I purchased a second pair and they are working fine still. I recommend these.

It's not that these are a bad product, just highly misrepresented as waterproof and useful ...


It's not that these are a bad product, just highly misrepresented as waterproof and useful for sports, which is the reason i bought these.  If I were using them indoors I would probably be happy with them, but I bought them to use while bicycling.  The wind noise with these is absolutely terrible.  Riding into a headwind creates a roar that drowns everything else out.  I tried taping over the mic hole but it made no difference.  Also, I soon as the buds got damp they did not want to stay in...When I got home from riding I wanted to rinse them off.  IPX7 means they should be submergible, so a quick prince under the faucet shouldn't harm them.  So I rinsed them, very quickly, and there is water still seeping out of them, and the USB port was full of water even though the cap was secure.  If I was only using these indoors, again, they would probably be fine, but definitely are not as advertised.Finally, I started looking for something else after I got back from my one ride, and it appears there is an identical version of these being sold under another brand for a little more than half what these cost.  Spend your money elsewhere....

Great for gym workouts


This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I love them so much. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones for the gym--I admittedly do not do highly vigorous workouts, but for a light jogging, weight training, or cardio machine workout they are great! See below a list of pros/cons as well as a more in depth reviewPROS:- Comfortable!!- Easy to pair with phone- Long battery life- Noise cancelling is top notch- Easily packed up for traveling- Stay put in your earCONS:- The volume/skip buttons can be a little confusing at first (back button turns up the volume/skips the song, front button turns it down/goes to previous song)- The ""low battery"" alert can get annoying during a workoutFULL REVIEW:These headphones are amazing! They are so comfortable and TRULY noise cancelling (though you can still tell if someone is talking to you--just not what they are saying) I wore them for an at home workout while my roommate was watching TV in the same room and couldn't hear a thing other than my music. I wear them to the gym and can go 8hrs+ without having to charge them (so 8+ workouts, depending on how long my workouts last) The wire connecting the ear buds at the back of the head doesn't bounce at the nape of the neck, so you never have that thumping noise from the wire banging against things, and the ear buds themselves stay put and are comfortable. They are really simple to pair up with an iPhone (and I assume any smart phone), and now that I've paired it once, all I have to do is press the on button and they automatically sync. The only complaints I have are (1) the buttons on the side (for volume and skipping songs) took a bit of time to get used to, they felt ""backwards"" to me--the button in back (closest to the back of your head) is used for turning the volume up and skipping a song, and the button in the front (closest to your eye) is used for turning the volume down and going back to the beginning/a previous song (2) the low battery alert is frequent enough to be annoying during a workout, but happens so infrequently (because the battery life is so good) that it doesn't merit losing a star.Overall--I would definitely recommend these!

Poor Quality - Returned to Give a Lower Rating


These headphones are not quality connecting at all. It is taking me 5 or 6 tries before they will connect to my phone, even after they've been paired. The overall quality of the headphones feels like cheap plastic that will soon fall apart; which is confusing because the actual quality of sound and noise cancelling is decent especially for the price. It doesn't help if I can't enjoy the music though.Seriously considering returning them after only a day.I gave these my best shot, kept them beyond the time to be able to return them (honestly die to covid) but I am decreasing my raing to only star. When they connect and actually hold, decent sound quality. That's all I will give these. Not recommended at all.

I did not want to lose them as they come out of my ear easily. I must say


Bought them in January... Died today.... that is exactly less than 6 months of use.....Now the review...Pros: Incredible sound!, I bought these because I wanted to use for working out, I have a pair of apple AirBuds,  I did not want to lose them as they come out of my ear easily. I must say; these headphones have incredible sound, most inexpensive headsets you have to crank up the volume to get good quality sound. Well, you wont have to with these ones, lows are solid and mids and high are clear to the point that the volume can stay consistently in the mid range of the music and it will be pleasant whether you are running or at the gym or simply working with them.Cons: They died today... I have yet to put these thorough real hell, I am an avid runner and most of the time I run in dry weather, I do sweat, but no different than anyone who runs 5 miles at 8-9 minutes per mile.... For whatever reason, when I hit the 3 mile mark today they just stopped working and the blue light stayed on..like solid ON! I was not able to turn them on or off again... so I put them in my pocket and finished running... I placed them in my bag after getting ready and drove to work, just now as I type this review I am attempting to revive them and nothing... the light is now Solid RED! and they do not connect... SO I take they are finished... it is a shame that they did not even last 6 months...I guess is the last time I buy them

Solid sound quality, but a fairly cheap pair of earbuds


So to begin, I come from Jaybird X2's that i unfortunately lost while running (battery died so i put them in my not deep pocket...expensive mistake). So, I had just recently bought these for my GF, which instead I used. At first, I was very impressed by the sound quality, fitment and comfort-ability within the ear and to remain in place, and overall performance. Now after actually using them regularly for maybe a few weeks I've noticed the battery life is very weak and they need to basically be charged daily. Also, now while during runs (not related to low battery) the headset is randomly disconnecting from Bluetooth and my iPhone while on treadmill. Overall, decent pair of earbuds for $30, but the quality I don't believe is there since now that I am actually using them they fail. My suggestion is if you actually run regularly multiple times a week to go and spend some coin on a trusted brand that has proven quality.

Excellent Customer Service!


I’m giving this company 5 stars for their exceptional customer service. They were prompt, courteous and professional.  The product is great when it’s working and if it hadn’t stopped working suddenly I would’ve given it a 5 for the comfort, the range, the sound, and the price!Five months after receiving my headphones, I started having issues—they stopped working suddenly. Had a crackling noise from one ear bud, then it would fade out completely until one day later they stopped working. IImmediately  contacted customer service. They were prompt in responding (under 2 hours of sending my email) and provided the necessary instructions to attempt to reset my headphones. Sadly that didn’t work and my headphones still did not work. Since my headphones came with a 1 year warranty the company is sending me new headphones! Not only am I receiving new headphones but the company was very apologetic and had a very customer-oriented mentality which I appreciated.  The email was kind, professional and focused on making sure the customer was happily satisfied. I am! Thank you for your help! I look forward to receiving my new headphones in the next few days.

So Far So Good


I bought these headphones to replace a pair of 1MORE fit in-ear bluetooth headphones. If you're not too worried about the sleek design, these are a good (cheaper) replacement. The sound is comparable and the the over ear hooks HELP keep the buds in place. The over-ear hooks, however; can't be adjusted or manipulated to fit to the ear. They fit okay, but while going through daily tasks around the house, one occasionally needs to be adjusted because it'll come loose from the ear. The package came with additional rubber buds to help fit into the ear, but I haven't tried other sizes yet. This may help fix this issue. I can't imagine using these for any kind of recreational sport. The blue tooth range is fine. The charging cable has to be forced into the charging port; it feels like it's not supposed to fit but it does. Overall, they're decent for the price. Time will tell how durable they are.

More than satisfied


Needed a set of Bluetooth headphones for work. I was beyond frustrated using the wired headphones which came with my Galaxy S8 due to the wire constantly getting caught  in anything and everything; thus yanking the ear buds out of my ear(s).Let me say I am more than satisfied with my purchase. These earphones perform ALOT better than I had initially expected. The sound quality, clarity and bass level are perfect. The pairing process was simple as every, there are several options for earbus sizes, a nice storage case a charger and other items. The earhook sits comfortable around my ear, the hook material is soft and flexible. Due to being so light and comfortable, one can't tell a set of headphones are on. The noise cancelling is pretty good as well.Prior to my purchase, I scrolled past many, literally several other Bluetooth headsets reading through all the customer reviews and obviously I decided to go with this set. So happy with the choice I made.

Not even worth $20


If you are looking for a pair of headphones with a spotty Bluetooth connection and that crap out in the middle of running a marathon, you’ve come to the right place. When I first received these headphones as a gift, the connection was spotty but I chalked that up to my phone being a little older. When I got a new phone, the connection improved... but not by much.This past April, I ran the Boston Marathon. The night before, I made sure that these were fully charged and ready to go only to have them totally crap out at about mile 10 (about a hour and 20 min into the race). Thankfully, I packed my apple headphones as a backup and was able to switch. If it weren’t for the decent sound quality, I would’ve given these headphones 1 star.Save your money and spend them on higher quality headphones.

Died after 8 months, no response from customer service


I got this pair of headphones on 02/19 of this year while training for a half marathon. This year I ran around 15 races, the last one on 10/05. I decided to use them again while running errands in early November & noticed they were totally dead. I didn’t think much of it since it had been about a month since last using them, so I plugged them in to charge. Within a few seconds of plugging them in, a lil red dot will light up, & once fully charged will change to blue. The red light never came on which I thought was odd so I waited for a few minutes but still nothing. I even changed up the outlets, allowing it to be there for at least 5 minutes at each one, but nothing. I found the 1-year warranty I purchased & reached out to company on their website on 11/05, explaining the issue & asking for a replacement but never heard back. I’m disappointed because I really enjoyed this pair of headphones; the sound was good & they fit very comfortably in/around my ears. Unfortunately I’m dissatisfied with customer service & with the battery quality as they only worked for 8ish months before dying.

Sound quality is good but controls are backwards


The sound quality is good.  The fit is okay as well.  Not great.  But they do stay on.The controls are the exact opposite of every other Bluetooth headset I've owned.  When listening to music, the front button is the ""back"" button to repeat the track.  The back button is the ""skip"" button to go to the next track.The sound up/down and skip/repeat functions are also the opposite.  I'm used to tapping the forward button once to skip a song.  But with this headset, you have to hold it down and wait.  So if you're trying to skip multiple songs at the same time, it takes FOREVER.The quick tap function is to raise and lower the volume, which is something I rarely feel the need to do.  Certainly far less than skipping/repeating songs.  So like I said, the functions are opposite from what they should be.

Very pleased thus far


I haven't used earbuds in years because normally I can't find any that don't fall out of my ears, regardless of material that supposedly molds itself to your ear or a multiplicity of different sized inserts. I've been using headphones but they're bulky to pack and I travel a lot, so I decided to give one of these hook-over-the-ears models a try. I did a lot of research and these SENSOs had the most and best reviews for something under $50.  I'd had Shure earphones before (cost $150) and they sounded great but always fell out.So far I'm very pleased with the SENSOs. They sound close to the Shures and they stay in my ears, plus they have the microphone and controls to answer the phone, which the Shures (which were wired, not Bluetooth) didn't have. I also like the audible feedback for power on and off and pairing state.I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need the absolute best sound quality, but I hate tinny sounding audio. These provide good balanced bass and clarity and that's good enough for me. They definitely sound far, far better than my Samsung Galaxy S7's speakers.I've only had them for a few days so I can't speak to durability, but they appear to be well made and I'm hoping they'll last a long time.

Great Product and Great Customer Service


I bought a set of Senso S250 earbuds back in March of 2018. It has been great for working out, for travel, listening to music at work. I highly recommend the memory foam ones.Last week my earbuds just stopped charging. They would turn on, connect, work, but could not connect to any of the micro USB chargers I had. I reached out to customer service around 6:45am on Thursday morning, and by the next Monday I had a new pair in my hands. Quick, easy, and courteous service.I love these earbuds and would have gladly bought a second pair, but the 1 year warranty awarded me a pair to replace the non-charging ones. Just in time for another trip! Those memory foam earbuds are great for airplane pressure and sound blocking!

Excellent Customer Service


Had them about 4 months, had an issue with them. Up until then the headphones are amazing, can handle getting wet from sweat, and give a crisp sound. I work out 7 days a week in them for about an hour to 1.5 hours daily. I only charge about 1-2 times per week. They hold their charge. The issue of them not powering on was resolved by customer service on 12 hours, and I was emailed and kept in the loop about the replacement. They honored the 1 year warranty and within 12 hours of my complaint and provided prompt and courteous service. The replacement was in the mailbox within a day. The best customer service I have received in a long while compared to my other experiences. Their customer service and quality product, I would buy another pair.  They are awesome at Senso,and put the customer first.

Almost perfect.....almost


These are good for the priceFirst the voices of the music is crystal clear but the bass is flat and just tries to hit to hard and muffled..which can be fixed with Apple's built in eq or a third party app for Android, I used equalizer and bass booster..see photos for my settings...the battery last a really long time and it came fully charged. They are more comfortable than my beats and lightweight the foam tips are great and they do not fall out...however due to the size protruding out when I'm biking they pick up allot of wind noise..I can pause answer the phone and skip songs with them..they are loud allot louder then my wired headphones and maybe even my beats....I would say fix the base and the size of these and they would be my go to every time...even if they cost $100....I like that they say power on and power off when turning them on or off...their is a flashing blue led of the front of one of them that I could do without...its a little annoying when I use them to watch tv at night..but not a deal breaker...for the price with a couple tweeks you can't go wrong..my comparison are based off power beats and and Jay buds...

get better from previous versions. noise canceling and stays firm


Let me talk about my routine and then you are going to understand better.I run everyday 6 miles which is around of 45 minutes more 30 minutes of workout. I was taking shower everyday with my phone. I just don't want to stop listening to the podcasts. I always charge once and run for two days. For some reason when I went for the second  day the phone was dead. If i put it to charge again it will work normally. For that reason I look for something new but I couldn't because the price and quality is really good at this phones. The other reviews from other phones are always about some problem. So yesterday I bought a new one and I noticed that the size decreased, the sound improved and it fits better (maybe because it is knew, i don't know). So if you don't want to get bothered with your headphones and you just want to complete your workout with quality, I think that's a good option. Sincerely....

These nice headphones pair well with the Lantoo 2-in-1 3.5mm Audio Wireless Adapter


I used these with the Lantoo 2-in-1 Audio Wireless Adapter. To save time I'll paste what I wrote below. Very nice product, came with accessories and a carrying case, simply plugged into USB and charged an hour or 2. I watched an entire movie, listening to the audio on my computer in these headphones, acrosss the room. I recommend!On Transmitter Review:""I bought this Bluetooth Transmitter to send audio from my laptop (which is attached to a bigger monitor) to a SENSO Bluetooth headphones. I was able to lay in bed and watch from across the room. Pairing was surprisingly easy, just had the headphones close and held the button on the transmitter until it began pairing. The audio dropped a couple times when I was first getting comfortable in bed, I think it was because I was resting my head against the wall?? I simply put a pillow more between my head and the wall and it was fine. Using the Senso headphones, I could walk around freely in my room and hear it the whole time. It's a simple to use product that's effective for the purpose I mentioned.""

The incoming sound quality is excellent, loud and clear


The incoming sound quality is excellent, loud and clear. The outgoing sound quality sounds like a desktop speaker phone and that's very good considering the microphone is above your ear. I love the controls, particularly compared to the big name competition. There's one big button that turns it on/off and answers phone calls and pauses what's playing and the button always knows what you want it to do! There are other buttons to raise and lower the volume and they are positioned so you never get confused or accidentally hit the wrong one.The ear loops are an absolute necessity if you are going to move at all while you're wearing headphones. There are various sizes of ear ""plugs"" provided but the ear loops are not adjustable. If you like a real snug fit this may be disconcerting but they do stay in place well enough to hear clearly. These are the least expensive ear buds I own and I like them the best.

Outstanding Invotek Service


My 5-Star rating is for the quality of service I received from Invotek and not for the quality of the headphones.  I bought these headphones because I read a newspaper or magazine review that these headphones were comparable with $150 Apple headphones.  I can't compare these with Apple, but these headphones are simply OK, not fantastic.  I would rate these headphones as about 4 stars on it's own merits.  It's fine for my use at the gym or out running, but if I wanted quality sound this would not be it.The reason for my 5-Star rating is that these headphones died on me after just over a month....too late to return to Amazon.  I then contacted Invotek's customer service on a Sunday, and by Wednesday, I had already received a brand new replacement set.  These headphones come with a one year warranty.  Backed by this kind of service, I really feel I got my money's worth and and happy with my purchase overall.

Nice sound, Blutooth fails


I'm trying to decide how I feel about these wireless headphones. I bought them because my last set (Platronics) had finally crapped out. I didn't want to spent $80 on another set, and the Platronics didn't perform well in the gym. They were designed to allow external sounds into the ear as well as music, for safety reasons. But, the Platronics were overwhelmed by the gym's music system and when walking, road noise. So, I settled on the Senso headphones because they were reasonably priced, they supposedly had noise cancellation capability, and the reviews on sound quality were good.  But .......I just got the product from Amazon this week and I've used them at the gym on three seperate days. On each of those days the Blutooth crapped out about the same time sweat began to appear in and around my ears. Attempts to restart the connection, restart Spotify, and changing the order of attempt steps ... all failed.  I tried waiting five minutes and trying again, no dice. At one point I thought it might be something in the gym environment, so I left the gym while I was still a bit sweaty, went to my car, tried again. No dice. I could tell the headset was trying to reconnect with the cell (iPhone 6s) and it would succeed for a second or two and then drop.So, after these failures, I would take the buds out of my ears, leave them for 15 to 20 minutes, try them again, and everything would be working fine. I'm going to give them one more try this weekend and if it's another fail, I'm sending them back.I want this product to work because the sound quality is pretty good.There's one other concern. I normally don't expect headphones used for exercise to last more than 6 to 8 months. Between sweat and gym activity, it's a tough environment for headphone survival. This set has a connector wire between the ""phones,"" and I am extremely skeptical about it's surviving that long.It's possible I may keep this product and just use it for listening at home or while doing more gentle activities, but I'd really like to see if the product design is the problem or if it's this particular set.UPDATE: I attempted to resolve my issues using advice from Senso Support ... which was a repeat of info found in the instructions. It made the problem worse. So, I went through the 1900 negative reviews and noticed Bluetooth issues were a fairly common problem. I'm sure the company will figure out whatever issues they may have with Bluetooth, but in the meantime, I reordered the wireless Platronics Backbeat Fit. They're more expensive, they are not designed for noisy environments, but the product is sturdy and highly functional, and the sound produced is good quality.This whole experience had me wondering about Amazon's ""Best Buy"" designation and the draw of high numbers on ""sponsored products."" Checking against independent resources like CNET or cell phone sites, there are significant differences between what Amazon sponsors and what independent sites label as best buys. For me, it just means that I have to avoid mistaking review numbers as the deciding factor in what I buy and to look at resources other than Amazon when determining what I want. Buyer beware, I guess.

I leave my parting honest review for these amazing earphones.


These earphones, I have purchased in December 2016 were the first wireless set that I have used and they had an exceptional sound quality to them that could not be beaten for the price that was paid for them. These earphones were able to pick up other sounds in songs that other earphones in it's price range simply missed. The 8 hour battery life claim is accurate on these earphones, since I could keep listening to music for most of the day before having to recharge them. The IPX7 waterproof claim is also true for these earphones, since you can run them under some water and they would still work. Just don't expect them to survive when being worn for swimming. The overall comfort of the earbuds are so great that you shouldn't have any ear pain after wearing them for long periods of time. I will warn you that the noise cancellation in these earphones are powerful too, so expect to turn your volume down very low if you want to hear someone talk while wearing them. The only real problem I've run into with these earphones is the mic, which had it's times of being mediocre when others would mention that my voice sounded too low.Unfortunately, my pair reached the end of their life span after almost 2 years, as there was a short in the cord that caused one of the earphones to go out. Earphones were never made to last forever, but with that... I leave my parting honest review for these amazing earphones, so that others can see that they are worth giving a try.

This product mostly works well, and I am glad that I bought it.


I bought these headphones so I wouldn't have to hold my smartphone with my hands while out walking in the cold.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work so well.  Either the Bluetooth from my phone isn't strong enough or the receiver on this unit isn't strong enough to pick up the signal.  I still have to walk with my phone in my hand and my hand raised up a bit above waist height.  The volume on this unit is either too strong or too low.  There is a volume rocker (?), but I can't adjust the sound as I would like.  Usually when I am walking, I leave the earbuds out a bit from my ears so I can hear but I don't hurt my eardrums.  When I am inside and don't have to deal with outside noise, though, I the lower volume setting is just right.  I like that I am not attached by a wire to my smartphone.  Recently, I have begun using these with my new computer which has Bluetooth.  I am enjoying these earbuds.  I just wish I had a better connection to my smartphone while walking.  I don't know where the fault lies.

Muffled sounds and disappointment


I am hard of hearing and this was my best hope for really good sound quality. After looking at other reviews, many said it sounded amazing and the sound was only at 50% volume. I figured this would be too good to be true at this price. I figured, what a steal! It came in and the packaging looked great. I took them out of the case which comes with everything as shown in the product images. I paired them with my Samsung S7 and it paired immediately. Then I put them on and for me, it was not as comfortable as I hoped for. I changed out the ear buds and it then felt better.Time for the music! I eagerly then browsed through my songs looking for one with the right amount of bass and rhythm and found the perfect song. I started playing it at 50% volume and my expectations came crashing down. The sound was very muffled and i figured I'll boost it up. At 70%, the sound was obviously there but the lyrics were not clear and still muffled.Then brought it to 100% and it sounded tinny. Not clear at all and muffled. For those that praise this, it works for you but if you are hard of hearing, I highly recommend going with Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, or Sony headphones because those have always sounded crisp and very clear to me. Although they are more on the expensive side, it is will worth the value whereas these only led to disappointment. You do not know until you try though!

Impressive out of the box, but some charging problems.  5-star service in addressing the problem.


I just got my new wireless headphones.  I was impressed with the packaging and the instructions.  Pairing with my iphone was a breeze.  The controls seem simple enough, and I have the volume and forward/back figured out.  Now for the big test.  Today I am off to the gym to try these wireless babies out!  A quick update.  I loved them at the gym, and the battery life was great.  Not the ""was.""  I was unable to get the headphones to charge, so I had to return them to Amazon.  However, I am keeping the 5 star rating and assume this was an aberration.  I will be taking pair #2 to the gym tomorrow.  They are so good that they deserve a second chance.  A quick update.  My second pair failed after 45 days, too late to replace them with Amazon.  They simply quit charging.  I called Senso, and after a short conversation they said that the product was covered under their 1 year warranty and that they would ship me a new pair.  I am keeping the 5-star rating.  I hope the third pair is the charm!

Stopped charging - Updates!


Purchased on May 29th.  Stopped charging yesterday.  Tried several different cables and chargers.Charged these less than 10 times since purchase.  Very disappointed.---Updates!Customer service at Senso is awesome!  Quick response by email and stand by their product warranty!Pretty sure I had a fluke pair.  Cannot wait for the replacements to arrive!---Updates!It is October 11th, and my 4th set are on the way.  Newest set charged once, and never again.While the customer service is amazing, the product quality... ehhh, maybe not so much.  Charged the last set using ONLY the supplied 12v adapter and still crapped out.

Decent


I like these ear buds except for a couple of things.1.) I have yet to see them last 8 hours before going dead.2.) They take forever to charge for only lasting about 6 hours.They do fit comfortably though, and the sound is decent, but I wouldn't say the sound is Great.I was really hoping they truly did last the full 8 hours. I use them to listen to music and the gospel while I'm cleaning or working out.Update: We bought two of these 4-2017. I gave one pair away and the other my husband uses daily. The other day I came to Amazon to look for another pair of sporty headphones which is how I realized my husband has used the same pair without issue for a little over TWO years. That's pretty great to me so I'll be buying myself another pair of these. We bought two of these 4-2017. I gave one pair away and the other my husband uses daily.

Great sound quality, stands up to running.


These are the third pair of wireless headphones I got (after returning the first two) and I absolutely love them.  I'm a runner and have taken them on just a couple of runs so far (~10 miles), but they've stood up to sweat as well as to the constant motion.  Things that I love about these:1. Sound Quality - Bass, mids and heights all sound awesome.  Who knew that I didn't have to give up quality sound on a run (at this price)?2. They don't move around while running - an earlier pair that I returned had to be adjusted a lot3.  The wires do not stick to the back of my neck as I sweat - again, the other pair stuck to my neck and pulled on one earbud or the other.  I had to put the wire to the front of my neck with that other pair to avoid this annoying feature.If I were forced to mention a downside - they're a bit larger than I expected, but nevertheless still very light - so really I do NOT have a complaint about these headphones.

Great headphone for money but the EQ of them needs some work.


I like everything about the headphones except the EQ of them. They have too much low end and not enough mids and highs. In order to get the mids and highs up where they need to be you have to turn the volume up and then the mix is too loud and the bass is distorting. There needs to be a way you can change the EQ and then I would give it a five star. I'm a musician and a sound guy so this really sticks out and bothers me. The way the headphones feel on my ears is perfect. Once they are on you can't hardly tell they are there. Connecting to the headphones was no problem. My iPhone 7 plus connected to them right away. As far as the user controls on the right headphone, they are pretty good. The big button on the side turns them on/off and answers/hangs up calls nicely. The volume/track buttons on top are crisp and also work like a champ. The volume these headphones can reach is definitely way more than anybody needs. But if your listening to metal or hard rock the bass is so high that the mix sounds really muddy and distorting. I realize these are only $36 so I really can't complain to much about the sound. For how much they cost you can't beat them. But if your going for sound quality, you get what you pay for.

Really, Really great earbuds!


I only received these earbuds a few days ago. Upon first use after(just trying them on and playing around with them)is they are literally the most comfortable earbuds I have ever owned. You can just barely tell you have them on.  So I wore them to workout today, they didn't move, no cord noise and I wouldn't call them completely ""noise cancelling"" they are real damn close! They sound better than any set I owned too! I've owned at least a dozen in the past. They feel like they are built with quality. Not cheap feeling at all.  I wear them at work and the gym. For being under 40 dollars you cant go wrong. My wife usually cant stand earbuds of any type. After she tried mine out she requested I get another pair for her. I really cant say enough good things about the feel or sound or price! I'll just have to wait and see how long they last. Get a pair of these, you'll be glad as hell you did. Thanks Senso!

Decent but full of odd annoying quirks.


For what I paid, these headphones are decent. I haven't paid much attention to battery life, but it's sufficient for my needs. A few complaints:1. The earbuds will randomly beep LOUDLY in my ear, usually when my music is paused, but not always. This always startles me and physically hurts my ears.2. The sound is a little muffled. I don't notice it after awhile, but it isn't the most spectacular sound quality.3. The earbuds hurt my ears after awhile, so I'll have to try out a different type of wireless earbud that doesn't wrap around my ears.4. The minimum volume required is too loud. By this, I mean that whenever I try to turn down the music on my iPhone, the sound on the earbuds gets muted. In order to use my earbuds, I must turn up the volume uncomfortably loud. This is a huge flaw that leads to hearing damage, and it's very frustrating to me.

Great product but the wire is a little annoying.


This is a really good product. It has a lot of great features, most of which have been touched on by other reviewers. I was pleasantly surprised by how multi-functional the buttons on the earpiece are. They also come with a bunch of charging accessories that honestly seem like bonuses. It can't hurt to have them around! The sound quality and range are pretty good. The only problem I have with it is the little wire that connects the two earpieces. It's quite short and ends up touching my neck. I generally don't like things touching my neck and this can feel kind of cold. In any case, I would really love it if they came up with a fully wireless headset. The right piece can receive the signal from the playback device and then send the stereo signal to the left piece. I'm not an engineer, so maybe this is not a good idea, but the wire is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.

I wish I could become the music...


I bought these because I no longer wanted to be tethered to my phone. I was ever so slightly put off by the low low price but...These headphones are a steal at the current price. The guy that mentioned the bass was to heavy and needed to be reigned in must like his music sans bass. The bass in these headphones is clear and doesn't muddy up the sound. I have tested these with bands from Radiohead, to Rush to Nine Inch Nails and have had no reason to adjust the bass and the music sounds really good, . These things are crisp and clear and I prefer them to my Bose headphones.On another note, I have small ear canals and the smallest earbuds they include fit my ears fine and I don't have any fatigue so far (longest listening sessions was 4 hours or so). I like them so much that I just bought a second pair. I will be sad when, as invariably everything does, they break. I may hold a funeral.

So far so great


I'm rating these after only a few days, but so far these are outstanding. The over-the-ear piece is very flexible and not rigid making it very comfortable for extended wearing. The inner ear piece fit comfortably and did a great job of blocking sound without giving me that pressure feeling in my ears. I used the largest buds to keep them from inserting too deep in the ear. My favorite thing, which I wasn't sure I'd like, is having all the controls on the earpiece. My previous set from a different manufacturer had the control dangling from the ear on the cord and the persistent bouncing and assymetrical design of having that on one side always caused problems pulling them out of ear when running. This pairs, that is not an issue. Minimal buttons with maximum control options and they aren't too bulky on the ear. They didn't budge through my hour long run or get uncomfortable or lose power. Sound is plenty loud enough and the sound quality is above average but not audiophile worthy. Excellent for working out. I swear a lot and had no issues. Last manufacturers didn't last more than 4 months. I will update this review if something happens. Also the included accessories were a welcome surprise. Great product(so far) and great price. Nice work.

Not great, could be worse


Spotty connection.  Can't figure out how to consistently connect.  Sometimes I can workout and leave my phone on the bench, no problem.  Other times, I get really messy audio unless I'm holding my phone and wearing these.  Microphone is garbage, I have not been able to use this for phone calls.I did think there was a problem fitting these to my ears, but it comes with different sized ear-buds, so I went with the smaller ones and fixed that issue.  Charges relatively quickly, though the lightning charger that comes in the case worked for less than a day.  I threw that out thinking the rest of the package was good, so when I started encountering all the problems with bad connection, I couldn't even return the device.I would recommend this to someone listening to music at their desk, or on a train, or somewhere relatively sedentary.  Would not recommend for workouts or anything that separates you from your device more than 2 arms' length.

Very useful for a service tech’s job


Very useful for a service tech’s job.  For the money it is a good deal.  In the field I can take calls and listen to other people talking in front of me. For music quality and comfort, I find headsets are better and more comfortable than earbuds, but these are okay even though they are earbuds.  For listening to music hours on end use a headset.  This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  This is no black mark, because Apple’s earbuds are similar.However, they have advantages over headsets.  These do the job well for answering short calls in the field without whipping out my iPhone. They are very easy to use and don’t get hot on your ears in the summer like headsets.  Also,  they fit better under a cap during the winter than headsets, because headsets are more bulky.  I recommend them.

Meh...missing features.


Not bad. Sound is very good with Good Bluetooth range.The ear hook is very soft, which is good, this and makes for a comfortable fit. The cables impart quite a bit of vibrational noise into the bud as your head moves.The Audio level steps are kinda big. In other words, one click up may make it too loud but one click down is too quiet. This brings me to my biggest complaint.When connecting to the headphones the Phone Bluetooth audio level is used. The headphone them selves don't have there own ""remembered volume"". In my car or other devices the phone Bluetooth volume is 90-100 %, so when I switch to the SENSO the volume is PAINFUL. add to this that there is no soft on when connecting. SO the quiet of the in ear buds goes to Max volume instantly. Other Bluetooth headphones I've owned in this price range have their own volume control that is independent of the Bluetooth volume of the phone and the level is saved connection to connection. I am going to order a different brand put these in my office drawer permanently.

Great bluetooth earbuds for a very reasonable price.


I've had these for almost a month now and have been using them nearly every day. They last me about 2-3 days of heavy usage, and almost a week if I only use them on my lunch break.The sound quality on them is pretty good, overall good response from low-end to high-end, and they can get LOUD if you need. They also do an acceptable job of blocking out unwanted sounds. These come with 3 different size earpieces so you can find the size that fits (I need to play with these too, mine slip out a bit, but I'm still using the earpieces that it shipped with.) The ear hooks are quite comfortable and completely flexible, a definite bonus for me since I wear glasses.My only gripe is the cord that connects the two. Having come from recently using a set of LG Tones (R.I.P.) I am somewhat used to being able to only wear one earbud at a time if needed (Such as being on a phone call at work or listening to music while I work) and not having the earbuds slide around on me. I am getting used to working with this, and have found that hooking the earbud I'm not using at that moment to my collar seems to work acceptably and doesn't pull the one in my ear around.Overall, a definite buy recommendation from me.

Best bluetooth sports headphones I've owned


I have owned several different pairs of bluetooth sports headphones but nothing compares to the value, quality, and generosity of these so far.  The price is a good balance - all of the others I bought were way too expensive.  Yet, the quality was the surprise - I thought for the good price I would get poor quality but the care put into the construction of these, the packaging surrounding them, the audio output (including noise cancellation), the carrying case to protect them, the way they seem to be durably made to last a long time, and the extras included, simply blew me away - it was a delight.  Finally, the generosity of the company - providing extras (the car mount, the card holder, and even this arm band) were a total surprise - something I haven't seen a company do in years - I wanted to express how appreciative I am and simply cannot express the surprise and joy it brought me.  Please don't change anything - keep a good balance (so that you earn well but customers save enough), keep working on quality, and don't let accounting folks tell you that delighting people (with extras) will lead to decreased bottom line - it will cause your product to get recommended to others and will continue to be a bestseller, well reviewed, etc.(NOTE: I've owned these five days now - will update this review if any negative experiences or more positive ones arise over time)Update 6/8/2019 - It has been a few more days and I've exhausted the battery first time  - charging now.  The first chink in the armor is found but it is really a design choice.  I got a warning 'low battery' during exercise and was hoping it was like an hour away warning and would happen every ten minutes or so.  The warning was about once every two minutes.  And I was about six to eight minutes away it seems.  Then device shutdown leaving me a little bit miffed.I doubt firmware updates can happen on these - so want to make a suggestion for future batches of this product: Please have it announce battery level much earlier and less often (hour away ideally, every ten minutes).  Add a 'battery about to run out' (or 'battery critical') at the six-eight minutes mark.  And ideally, if possible, have it announce battery level (yes, 'high', 'medium', 'low', 'critically low') at initial power up.  If you make a set with these features, please let us know, I'll gladly buy another set (and will use these as my backup then).Not enough to take any stars away - I'll work around it but would rather not run out of battery via surprise again in the future.

If you have small ears.....


I could not get this things to stay in my ears no matter how hard I tried to jam them in and twist them. I kid you not I spent probably 5 minutes trying to get them to stay in, and when I'd finally get them to sort of stay in, they'd pop out if I moved my head slightly. They come with different size removable ear buds, but even with the smallest ones attached, these things still wouldn't stay in my ears. I guess I have super small ears??? (I have no problem with iPhone ear buds staying in though). Also, in the process of trying to get them to stay in, I kept accidentally pushing the buttons, one of which causes the iPhone to call the last number that was dialed. Super annoying. The hooks that go over the ears didn't fit me either. Way too big.EDIT: Bumping these up from 1 star to 4. If you're having trouble getting these to stay in, see fit adjustment suggestion from the manufacturer in the comments section below! I tried what they suggested and now I can get these in my ears and it didn't take 5 minutes of struggling to get them in, either.

So I have been searching for a good set of headphones


So I have been searching for a good set of headphones, earbuds, whatever you want to call them for some time now. I wanted bluetooth, wireless, whatever you kids are calling it these days because I'm tired of pulling out the plugin all the time, especially when mowing and exercising. I have found the solution, and not just a good set but a great set. These earbuds stay secured in my ear, even when I'm stumbling and bumbling around. I'm not tangling myself up in the cord and best of all the charge lasts forever or close to it. I have now went through 4 workout sessions over 6 days without plugging them in. Awesome. Now Spring just needs to get here so I can test them out on the mower. Oh and the sound quality is great, my kids have Beats by old what's his name and they sound great also but with my ears I can't tell the difference, Howard Stern sounds great on both. However, my wallet can tell the difference, if you know what I mean. One other thing, they came with a charging cord for my iPhone, not sure why, but it's the most durable charging cord made, what an added bonus. Thanks SENSO, keep up the 5 star work! You kick arse!

Truly the Best Buy with a great company to back it!


This is such a wonderful product. In every facet of performance it has been excellent. Customer Service people are top notch as well. Had some problems with the battery I believe. After 5 months of pretty constant use the battery Just gave up the ghost. Wrote a note to customer service and they got back with me promptly.... less than an hour! They were very helpful in giving me some instructions to troubleshoot the problem. When that didn't get the desired result, they notified me that they're sending me a new one...which is another thing to remember: this awesome item I believe has a 30 day no questions asked return policy and a ONE YEAR MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY!! I am a witness to this companies backing of its product! Their Customer Service were awesome and made it painless and pleasant! They've got me hooked. As long as they will make this product, I'll be buying it! Thank you Invotek! You're awesome!

They work, but only expect thin, shrill sound compared to even standard name-brand earbuds.


I am surprised there are so many people buying these, that can't tell a difference in sound quality between these and even standard name-brand earbuds that are twenty dollars more. After reading all the highly praised reviews, I thought I'd try a pair. I compared it to my current Samsung ""Level U"" standard earbuds I bought a couple years ago, and the SENSO doesn't even compare. The SENSO is like instant coffee, and the Samsung is gourmet. Actually any name brand earbuds would be much better then these. They have a shrill, thin sound. I am returning them, and will gladly spend much more money, to get better audio drivers in my earbuds. I am returning these, and will gladly pay more of a premium to get better sound quality. Life is short.

Great for running


Overall an excellent value.  I use this headset for running and based on the last two 10k runs, I had no issues whatsoever with these falling off or the cable bouncing against/irritating my neck.  The foam-earbud especially will fit to the shape of your ear canal and stayed in place.  It fit so well that it filtered out most of the external voice so you'll have to be careful if you want to hear a bit of external noises. As other review suggested, there is a wind noise when running outdoor but I ran indoor most of the time.The headphone works great and connected to my phone without any issues.  Great sound quality and different earbud sizes ensured a great fit.I received a newer version of this which doesn't come with the car chrager and charging cable but instead a card pocket and car mount for your phone.  Upon contacting Customer Service -- they were very responsive and straight up with this transition and opted to ship out the accessories that was listed in the Amazon description.

Loses connection often


These are the second pair of these Bluetooth headphones I purchased.What I like: They are very loud. I have no problem hearing them in a crowded subway or on the street. They stay firmly in your ears when working out, and don't get in your way. They are double as earplugs.What I don't like: They are VERY loud. Sometimes the lowest volume setting is too loud and I am worried about ruining my hearing. The worst part is that they keep disconnecting from my phone while I am listening. I'll be listening to music or a podcast and it will just stop, with no warning. Then I have to wait a few seconds for it to reconnect. I don't know why this happens. It was fine for the first few months, and then it started doing this. Another annoyance is that there is about a 5 minute warning from when the battery is low until the headphones die. This is especially frustrating if I haven't charged it and I have already left my house for the day.

Terrible fit


I do not normally leave reviews, however I feel the average number of stars for this product can be very misleading. My review does not reflect the sound (which is good), but rather the fact that I cannot use them at all for the purpose I intended them to, which was working out (I'm not even talking about high-impact work-outs, but simple ones like riding a bike). The piece around the ear is so incredibly flimsy, it does not adjust and does not hold around my ear, and the pair just keeps on falling if I don't readjust them every 30 seconds. It is quite frustrating, so I just stopped using them and unfortunately missed my window for return. I do not use them at all. My boyfriend does have the powerbeats, so I had that sturdy pair to compare these to. If you plan to use them for anything other than sitting still while listening to music, I suggest to spend your money on a sturdier brand. At the very least, physically try on a pair before you purchase online.

Don't buy these headphones!!! Customer Service it the worst


Well let me start out by saying that I have bought some very quality headphones over the past couple of years. These headphones are actually really good for the price, but the headphones that I purchased worked great for about a month. The button on the side of the headphones while listening to music one night stuck in the casing, it would not pop back out. I tried to use a very small sunglasses screw driver to pull it back out, but it was stuck in permanently. I called the insurance first as I paid the extra money for this plan, just in case I broke them as I do on most all of the stuff I buy. The insurance told me that this is a manufacture warranty and that I need to contact them, so I did. I first contacted them on Feb 21st by email. I received an email back on Feb 22nd saying:Senso Support 1 (sensohelp)Feb 22, 5:18 AM PSTHello Eric ,We are really sorry to hear about the issues with the headphones. We appreciate you reaching out to us and giving us this valuable feedback.  We take customer and product feedback very seriously and our goal is to ensure that each customer gets the highest level of quality products.Please send us your Amazon Order ID so we can look into this further.  Rest assured, we will take care of this issue for you to ensure you are fully satisfied.Thank you,Sebastian LemondSenso SupportSo, I thought, wow what great customer service. I responded back immediately with my order number and waited, and waited, and waited.  On March 16th, I sent another email stating that I have not heard anything back and can someone please reach out to me to let me know what I am suppose to do with the headphones.  March 19th, today I received an email stating:Hello Eric,We are sorry to hear that your headphones got damaged. Unfortunately, the Senso 1 Year Warranty covers functional defects and not accidental damage. We will not be able to offer you a free replacement but can offer you a 10% discount code that you can use to purchase a replacement.Really??I never said that I damaged the headphones. They never even saw them or asked me what happen to them? I thought that they take customer service very seriously? This is not what I would consider customer service. I sent them a follow up email stating that I did not damage them, so we will see what happens. So, with all that said do not buy these headphones unless you are okay with them breaking after a month, just to go buy another pair.

Super Great Minus One Thing


I really like the sound quality of the wireless earbuds, however for people with small ears they do not fit very secure. They kept falling off, which was irritating. The over the ear piece is not adjustable or bendable to wrap around. But again, they sound super good! Noise cancellation FIVE stars! I don’t hear NOTHING! That was the one thing kept me giving it 5 stars. Your ears may be bigger than mines and fit perfectly, mines not so much. I have to find another pair now, I need something more snug. I wish they came with changeable over the ear pieces they would get 10 stars from me!

2 years and 5 months later they finally died -- here's what I did to these things


I used and abused these headphones. I originally got them in March of 2018. I jinxed myself and re-marked to someone how my little cheap $25 headphones had outlived 2 of their 'airpods' and of course they died this month. Stopped syncing to my phone.I used these things almost daily to do workouts like running, lifting weights, burpees, listening to audio books for HOURS at a time. I even threw these against a wall in a moment of frustration over something completely unrelated to the headphones and the housing came open. I snapped them back together, STILL they did kept working!For $25, these were amazing while they lasted. Is it the BEST sound quality? No. Is it amazing for battery life? No. Do you get 7 to 10 hours of them? Easy... Does it do an incredible job for the price and if they break you don't feel like you are out a ton of money? Yes.If you are looking for some headphones you can use and abuse and if they get lost you don't feel like you need to sell a kidney to replace them....these are an awesome choice.

Solid first pair of wireless earbuds.


I really like these.  First set of wireless buds for me.  Highly recommend wireless.  The multitude of uses without having the wire is huge.Good.  Comfortable.  Multiple buds to fit your ear.  Unless I'm exercising they remain where put even without the loop over the ear.Length of battery.  About 8 hrs.Recharging.  Quick.  Not sure of time bit 30 minutes gets you plenty.Sound is as good or better than other buds.Water resistance has been solid.  Through rain. And lots of sweat.Look - I like the fact I don't have a battery sitting on my neck.The less than goodSize is not huge bit is noticeableWind gives a ton of noise.  Would be unusable on a windy day or on a bike.  I use on a unicycle and still get noise.Range .  10 ft at best.  Even at 6 I tend to get disruptionOverall solid pair of phones for this price.

Good for the price


Got these over a year ago and they are still working like when i first got them. The only issue is sometimes they dont connect to my phone right away and i have to turn them off and on again for it connect. I work out maybe 3-4 times a week and for up to an hour and a half and only have to charge these maybe once in a week, sometimes in two weeks. they are definitely worth the money would never spend the amount of money it cost for beats. the other thing is that in the title it says 'noise cancelling' but i can still hear background noise while at the gymUpdate: Sept 2nd 2019These bishes still work! Havent notice any change in the battery or sound quality since the first day i got them!! Def will buy again if these suckers ever dieJanuary 28 2021- still working! what the heck!

Not the same


I've been buying these same headphones for years. They used to last atleaet a year before the battery started failing. Now, I've went through 4 pair in 4 months. I'm a construction foreman and have them in most of the day so that I can hear someone calling me. The static and feedback in the calls is terrible. These used to be different. Best for the money. Now, not so much. Would not recommend at all, garbage.

REALLY DO LIKE 'EM ..........NOW!!


It took a while to get used to these headphones but I really do like them now. When I first started wearing them, they didn't seem to fit tight enough into my ear. They seemed to flop around and always came out despite the ear hook. I played around with them and finally found a way to get them in and have them stay. (Kind of ""screwed them in"" helped) Now I put them on and wear them while working on the pool and haven't drop them in ONCE!!!  I can put them on and  they pretty much cut out all sound around me.  I put a pair of ear protectors over them for mowing and they work great. The battery lasts at least  4-5 hours of continual use out of a charge and they recharge up pretty quickly. They may last longer but I don't let them totally discharge. You do get a verbal warning when the battery strength is too low-scared the hell out of me when it first happened.  I'm satisfied with this purchase and would buy these again

Nice but compromising to use if active


There a few nice features to these headphone, and a few compromises I've had to make to use them. The sound is really good, bold and loud! They charge really fast compared to the other three bluetooth headphones I've owned, and that has made them super convenient to use often. There are no doubts when they are charged, when they are connected to a device, and when they're powered off. However, they struggle to connect with devices, meaning the sound is really choppy at the beginning when they are supposed to be connected, and then it kicks in after about a minute, even when fully charged. Also, it has been difficult keeping a steady connection when my iPhone is in my pocket, and haven't had this problem before with other headphones. The biggest issue for me is the headphones pop out of my ears constantly when I am doing something active, although I've tried two different sized ear buds that came with the headphones. I haven't experienced that before with similar earbuds. Could be the weight of the earbuds is causing them to pop out. The ear supports really do not do much because they are flimsy if you are doing something active while wearing the headphones.

Good, Not Great


I got a fancy pair of wireless earbuds for Christmas that didn’t fit in my ears comfortably.  It prompted the search for “earbuds that fit in small ears,” which is how I found these guys.  For $20, they’re great.  I will say, they fit GREAT on/in my tiny ears.  I took them to the gym, and they work super well while running, lifting, etc.  However, during the course of my 30 minute workout, the music was cutting out really bad on two separate occasions.  Mind you, my phone was in my pocket, so it wasn’t a proximity issue or an accidental button push thing...  I ended up having to pause my music and restart the app.  This never ever happens to me with other Bluetooth headphones, so it leads me to believe there’s something funky with the buds.  But, like I said, for $20 it is what it is.

Poor microphone quality (cannot use for phone calls) and faulty USB charging cable.


Headphones work ok (not the best sound quality, but ""good enough""), however, the microphone has never worked well enough for making phone calls as people on the other end of a call always complain they cannot clearly understand me. I have been told me it sounds like there is a lot of noise on the call and it is impossible to have a conversation. Customer support has told me it is likely due to the other person's service, but if I switch to using normal headphones, the call quality is fine.In addition, I was initially happy with the extra USB charging cable that is included with the headphones, but that cable stopped working after a few uses. Very disappointed with the quality of this product and materials.Unfortunately, I only use these headphones a few times a week at the gym and they started to break down just after the 30-day mark, so I am unable to return them or exchange for another pair. If you use them daily, I would suspect they would break down much earlier.

I owned two versions of this product, it's gotten worse


Update*** yeah, save your time and $$$, and get a better pair. After sending me a message to find out what the issue was, they copy pasted an irrelevant solution message, which did not work. Since then, crickets— despite their suggestion that the unit was under warranty.I bought my first pair in 2017 and really liked it. The sound quality was fair and Bluetooth connection worked just fine unless it was windy outside. I unfortunately yanked the chord by accident and I had to purchase a new pair in August 2019. By this time Senso replaced the harder plastic that clips on your ears with a more flexible, malleable one. This version was harder to keep on, especially when working out in an interior environment. The sweat made the clips easily slip off. It stayed on much better while running outside. But after less than a year, the unit stopped charging. When I connect the USB chord, the charging light does not turn on anymore. Ultimately, it's a decent, affordable product but it has a short life span.

You Will Love them!


I am not one to leave long reviews but these deserve it. from the moment you look at the packaging you will be asking yourself how can they afford this quality packaging for $30. then when you open the box and see a dual port car adaptor (1 1amp and 1 2amp), 2 charging cords, a very nice semi hard carrying case, and 3 sets of different size tips you will think great these are going to sound awful. I charged them up and then quickly turned my Power Beats 3 off, paired these and left for the gym. although they don't have quite the same deep base and sound quality they are far better then any other wireless headphones I have used. they are also louder then the beats! remember these are $30 and the beats are ~$180 I have only used them one day but the battery was still showing 100% on my phone after 3 hours. The down side is they ear hooks are a little big and as they did not fall off my ears they did fall of my daughters. I liked them so much I bought 2 more pairs for my buddies to try out.

Excellent Sound Quality


Although I returned this item I actually truly liked it. My issues were1. the ear hooks were not adjustable and was too big for my small ears.2. mic was located on the ear area and between my soft spoken voice and my hair covering the mic, others had a bit of trouble hearing me.3. the ear pieces have some good weight to them and I basically use only one ear for phone calls so by them being heavy there was no way to clip the unused side to clothing and keep it from sliding down and tugging on the ear in use side. I purchased separate hooks to solve this issue but decided to send this headset back in the end for reasons 1 &2Positive note: They are of excellent quality, the sound is incredible. If you use both ears be sure to turn your device volume down, yes they are that good.If the mic was closer to my mouth and the ear hooks fit better I certainly would have kept this one. Hated to send them back.

Caesar never had it this good!


I planned to listen to recorded tour guide comments as I explored Ancient Rome and the Vatican City. Wireless headphones seemed like a good idea so I could keep my iPhone hidden in a pocket as I moved through the tourist sites. These headphones were the perfect answer to my wishes. I was pleasantly surprised that they worked so well. I used the headphones to control the narrative volume and to pause the narrative while I took photos or discussed the details of a site with others in my group. I also used them on the plane to/from Italy as well, where the noise cancelling feature was put to the acid test. All for a very low price. I am very satisfied! Julius Caesar never had it this good!

Very good earphones


Good basic headphones.  If you are looking to re-create a past experience  from a night at the Metropolitan Opera, these may not be for you.  They work fantastic for me to listen to talk radio or classic rock as I walk my dogs.  The loops around the ears keep them in place far better than the ear buds without the loops.  So far, battery life has been a non-issue.  I have yet to run the batteries down.  They are also nice and light so your ears don't get sore from wearing them.*UPDATE* I've had these a while now and I have to bump up my rating. For he money these are great. As of my prior review I had not changed out the earpieces to the smaller size. Fit is everything with these headphones. Now that they are properly in my ear they sound fantastic.  The battery life has been perfectly acceptable.  I'm sure you could spend a pile of cash and get some that sound better, but for the money these are great.

Terrible quality, tried 2 pairs, buy something else


I bought my first pair and they were ok. Paired with macbook pro and iphone just fine. Calls were terrible as described by others, the people on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me at all, so do not use these for calls. Then after a bit the left earbud started buzzing. It was a constant buzzing that was super annoying. I contacted the seller and they were nice and sent me a free replacement. After a few months the right earbud started being super quiet compared to the left. I tried factory resetting it and unpairing and repairing and also fully charging several times. No change. These are just horrible quality earbuds. If you want to get these cheap ones, there are much cheaper options around $10. But just get something nicer or name brand. THESE ARE HORRIBLE

On the positive side the sound quality is pretty good. They synced really easily with my phone


It’s hard to complain about these because they’re so cheap. However, they don’t fit around my ears correctly. As long as I don’t move they fit just ok but the second I move they fall off my ear. So personally I would never wear these for anything but sitting still at my desk at work.On the positive side the sound quality is pretty good. They synced really easily with my phone. I just turned them on and opened the Bluetooth on my phone and they were synced. They also make sound in your ear telling you they’re synced. Another thing I like is when they’re connected to your phone it shows the battery level on your phone so you know when to charge them.Ultimately these are great for the price but I had to give them a lower rating strictly for the fact that they don’t fit the shape of my ear well or stay put.

Sound doesn't transfer to headphones after a few weeks


These worked great for the first 2-3 weeks. Now, just under a month of having them, they are acting up. When I turn them on, they connect to my phone right away, but the sound does not automatically transfer to the headphones. I usually have to disconnect them, reconnect, and even then sometimes it won't work so I'll do it a couple of times. This is quite obnoxious when I'm trying to get my workout started and I'm fumbling with the headphones.EDIT 5/9/18 - Had to downgrade to one star. The headphones just won't work properly. I am having the same problem that I wrote about previously, but it's much worse. They connect to my phone and the headphone button will play/pause the sound, but the sound still plays on the phone. Really really annoying.

Easy setup, easy pairing, good controls, great tone for the price point!


Easy setup and pairing.Bit confused about the tie-cord thingamajig, but quick googling showed me what that little bit was for.Sound quality is much better than my previous $19 pair I got as a gift.Strong wind walking home, which snuck in a bit, but I haven't played with the various ear-plug sizes to see if that would limit the outside wind interference.  That said, a little bit of a bump up in volume (I tend to run volume on the low side) and the clarity compensated for the gusts of wind pretty well.No other internal interference -- my old pairs had an annoying sound of rubbing cables or static, but not this pair.I think there were a few bluetooth hiccups/pauses, but I'm thinking that may certainly have been my phone dropping in/out of wi-fi and pausing Spotify.

A great find!


I was ruining my bluetooth Bose headphones at the gym.  The ear pads were getting funky from all the sweat.  I knew I had to find something to replace them and I wanted bluetooth earbuds; no more funky, sweaty ear pads.  I took a deep breath and ordered these.  I thought, ""Well, they're not terribly expensive, so what have I got to lose?""  What a great find!  I'm used to the sound quality of the Bose and I gotta tell you, the sound on these little babies is pretty darn good!!  Okay, so what about distance?  Can I put my phone in the cubby and still receive a signal on the other side of the gym?  Yep, Sure can!  What about the battery?  Honestly, I only use them at the gym .. max. time 90 minutes.  When I get home, I pop them on the charger for about 30 minutes or so and I've never had a problem.  What about the cord?  This is where I was concerned.  I have waist length hair and was afraid the cord would get tangled up in my hair.  Nope, not a problem.  I'm pleasantly surprised and happy with my purchase.

Poor audio quality.


I don't write a lot of reviews. I really expected a lot more from these earphones because of high ratings on Amazon. It's obvious that $29 earphones can't deliver audio quality as good as a set of $300 from Sony.  Unfortunately I can only compare SENSO's audio quality to earphones sold at a Dollar Store or the earphones given away for free to airline passengers. Senso's mid-range is muffled, high range is almost non-existent and bass is very muddy. I've had much cheaper, Bluetooth earphones with a MUCH better sound quality.Audio quality gets ONE STAR! Overall rating deserves 2 stars because they included a free cellphone mount with the earphones (wonder why?).I wouldn't recommend this product if you expect a half-decent audio quality.

Batteries went bad on 2 sets, will not buy again


This is my second pair of these earphones. They work fine until they don’t. The first pair starting shutting off after only an hour or so. I would charge them and again, after an hour they would shutdown. Since I didn’t know what was wrong if anything I continued this loop for a month or so. I call the company and was told that they were out of warranty by a couple of weeks.Since the phones worked well in the beginning and were rated so well, I thought they were lemons. So I bought another pair. Guess what, the same thing happened exactly again. This time I tried recharging for a week or so. When I decided thta the same thing was happening again I checked my Amazon purchase and found they were out of the year warranty by 2 days. Called the company and they refused to warranty.Batteries seem to be a problem with many, maybe all of these types of phones. I WII NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.

OK if you never use them outside. TERRIBLE wind noise. Waterproofing suspect.


These are comfy and pair pretty easily, and the sound quality is OK for the price point. However, the shape and construction ensure that even the tiniest breeze will translate into a ton of wind noise in your ear. Trust me, no one can run slowly enough that this won't be a problem.  I also have sever doubts that this meets an ipx7 rating, which should mean these could be submerged underwater for half an hour. The little rubber gasket that covers the charge port is flimsy and insubstantial, and on mine, it doesn't stay in the charge port, falling out with the slightest handling of the earphone. I don't need to sink these in water, but I sweat enough to destroy electronics that aren't truly waterproof, and there's no way these will stand up to real summer running without getting soaked. Sadly, I'll be returning. These will be OK if you are only using them inside or on an airplane or similar.

Already dead :(


UPDATE on 10.15 - I was trying a variety of things hoping to make them work again, and I guess eventually something worked (not sure what exactly) so even though I appreciate being contacted by the company immediately, I will not be calling them, at least for the time being. I have headphones again, they’re working just fine at the moment, so there’s no reason to call customer service (unless god forbid they conk out again). But thank you for the quick response and attempt to resolve the issue!Approximately 3.5 months since I got these, and they've stopped working. At first, I loved my new headphones. I had no complaints, everything about them worked for me. I waited to write a review since I haven't had them for very long, but I was ready to gush about how amazing they are. Then today all of a sudden they won't play anymore.  It said ""connected"" and my phone showed that it was connected but I got no audio. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting them, restarting them and finally resetting to factory settings. Nothing.

Fantastic Bluetooth Headphones - Great Bang for the Buck


I've had mine for two years when Amazon had it featured as a ""Lightening Deal"".  There are a lot of cheap AirPod knock-offs and most are not very good.  This isn't trying to be an AirPod, as there is a cable between the left and right earbuds but they are bluetooth (thus wireless) to the device.  But these ARE very good- they are durable, lightweight and sound great.  I am no audiophile but I wear them running, biking, mowing lawn and other physical activities and after two years are as good as knew.  My son was impressed that instead of paying 7x for a pair of AirPods he liked these and is happy with them for his Iphone (I use Android).  Mine came with extra ear tips, micro USB cable and a sturdy but lightweight carrying case.  Now it appears they also add a wire tie, cellphone card wallet and car mount- a nice bonus if you need them.  A great value for sure.

A company that stands behind their products... Impressive ha?


I do not leave many reviews... much less many 5 stars. Why? maybe im not a fan of the costumer review system as i feel it stears me wrong sometimes. I will perhaps say that i want to leave reviews that reflect customer service interactions. IF the product goes in that review then that is ok too!

Thinking the company was going to blow off my request for a replacement i just went ahead and bought these. I didn't even give them a try to make it right. Except the second pair that i ordered came with a software defect that was quickly fixed with a hardware reset. When i informed them that i bought the new one just to replaced the old one the immediately offered to replace the old pair. Now this i did not ask for. They offered! These are the things that i give 5 stars for! Good customer service! Read other reviews to see how good these headsets are ( they are loud clear and have plenty of base!) If you are looking for a great pair or behind the neck headsets at a bargain price these are it! But what makes you come back is a company that stands behind their products! THis felt like an Apple kind of response but this is a small company that wants to build its reputation! IM convinced! Good job ! Very impressed!

This is the best ActivBuds update yet!


I'm on my 3rd pair of Senso ActivBuds and I'm really impressed by the product. The earbuds always comes in a nice box with a circular zipped earbud carrying case (which is great quality, I use it to store my other electronics), a faux leather business card holder for your phone (good quality, but not quite my style, so I don't use it), a magnetic phone clip to fit on your car vents (it's super powerful, however I don't use it because I'm concerned about having such a powerful magnetic near my phone), and best of all, they offer an assortment of small, medium, and large buds in case you're like me and tend to share my earbuds with people who like to change up the fit of their buds. In this most recent version of these earbuds the curved part that fits around your ears is bendy and moldable so you can make it fit around any ear. I love this addition because I just got four new upper ear lobe piercings and I can bend the earpiece to avoid touching and contaminating the area. Also included in this newest version are hard buttons! In former versions I've purchased the volume up and down buttons on the right ear bud were very soft and difficult to push but that's been remedied!One criticism that I have that has remained consistent through every pair I've purchased is that the power button has a thin matte layer of 'film' on it and it always ends up getting scratched. Cosmetically, it doesn't look very good so I always end up scratching it all off with my fingernails. It doesn't impede the power button in anyway however, so it's just nitpicking at this point.This is a great deal, trust me as a person whose bought $60 pairs of LG earbuds only to hace half the battery life and to fall apart in under a year.

Great choice for small ears!  Nice sound quality.


So far I am pleased with these SENSO headphones.  I have very small ears and have a difficult time finding earbuds that work for me.  These fit securely and comfortably.  Fantastic!  Having the option of different sized earbuds is great!  The sound quality is quite good.  They are comfortable and extremely lighweight.  The headphones came charged and ready to use.  Only negatives are: 1) Callers hear background noise. 2) USB port on the device is supposed to have a tab to pull it open.  It's just a nub, so I had to work on it with my fingernails for quite a while to get it open.  It seems a little easier to open as I use it.  3) I like to wear a headset around the house and not have to have my phone on me.  When I do this I notice that if I go in another room the connection is spotty.  If you are wearing it for working out and your cell phone is on you then there is no problem.

High Fidelity for Low Cost


High Fidelity for Low CostI didn't think that would really be possible, but these really are worth the money...  I was coming off of losing my Shure's and those were only ordered after 10 years of loving my Etymotic in-ear monitors that finally broke...  So spending the money on these wasn't the issue, but I read several reviews from users as well as industry reviews all of which said to give these a try.  For the money, it was worth a try - and I'm glad I did.I tried the original silicone buds at first, which were nice.  BUT when I changed to the foam which is much like my Etymotics use to be, it was even better...  great sound isolation (not noise cancelling) and solid performance.  I can't imagine the other ""big boys"" being worth the extra money over the sound quality I'm experiencing out of these.  I ordered 2 more sets for my girls...I would recommend!

They have actual customer support!


This is my second pair of Senso Bluetooth headphones. I use them almost daily for exercise and when on airplanes. I was so impressed with my first pair (which continues to work great after 2+ years) that I bought a second pair for my travel bag. Unfortunately, after 5 months, these S-250 headphones suddenly started connecting and disconnecting from my iPad during a treadmill run then went dead. They will not charge, respond to any button, respond to being connected to a charger, light up, etc. Dead...  I called the customer support number (which was answered directly by a customer service agent!!!) and they tried to troubleshoot the headphones with me. They confirmed that they were defective, confirmed my amazon order number and purchase date, and sent a replacement set right away. I was THRILLED with the customer support experience.So here I sit with dead headphones waiting for a replacement to show up and still I give these a 4-star rating? Yep. My other pair is still going strong after 2 years and with the customer support I just received, I’d still recommend the S-250s.  My original pair made it through several marathons, all of the training runs needed to get ready for them, and the rigors of traveling with me constantly working for an airline.

Had to return it I went with the Taotronics instead


I was extremely excited to try these headphones and when I first used them I was extremely excited. However it all went downhill from there.The first issue is the sound quality, I'm kind of an audiophile but didnt expect much from cheap headphones as I knew they wouldn't be great cause I was just gonna use them for running. Sadly however the bass was extremely muddy especially in much of my edm music I listen to. I had to resort to the 5 dollar walmart headphones in order to run happily lol. (I have separate over the ear headphones I use when at home)The Second issue was the wind. When running you can audibly hear the wind hitting the headphones and polluting your music... Not only that when riding my bike people couldn't even hear me over the phone because the wind would overpower my voice on the mic.I'm giving this three stars because of all the extra stuff it came with and how it came with foam tipped eartips which I enjoy. Also if your just using it in your house and nowhere else it would be great just don't expect to use it outside very much :/

Perfect for the gym


For this price, and for the purpose intended, these earbuds are perfect for me.  In short, I wanted something that worked for the gym:  stays in my ear while I'm sweaty and jumping, makes a good seal to block out external sounds, and something with no wires to deal with while lifting weights.  These do the job perfectly and for a great price.  Outside the gym I always use wired earbuds.  So this review is for one context.  I would definitely buy these again if needed in the future.I won't repeat much of what's been said.  I wanted to address a few concerns I had before buying these and one thing I read in some other reviews (wind noise).- Will that loop over the ear cause my ear to hurt?  I had earbuds with that loop many years ago and they hurt my ears.  No, the loop on these do not cause pain.  At all.  Of course, your experience could differ based on ear size.- That said, there is one part that can cause pain.  Look at my included picture.  For me, that part that sticks out right behind the earbud, circled in red, touches my ear.  And if I wear these for a prolonged period while they are dry and tight I get a bit sore there.  This has happened to me with many earbuds I've owned.  Perhaps I'm sensitive or my ear size is troublesome.  Overall I don't care because I just wear them at the gym and there they don't ""stick"" into my ear so tightly they cause pain.  Read on...- Will they stay in my ear during a workout?  Yes!  Absolutely.  Over many workouts that have included jumping jacks, burpees, sprints, and jump rope they have not fallen out once.  Now, as you sweat, they will get a tiny bit loose.  So you might find yourself repositioning a few times during a sweaty workout.  But I had no other expectations for workout earbuds!  If an earbud is so tight sweat doesn't make it wiggle a little, then they would have to be too uncomfortable to wear.  I think these are a solid middle-ground.  If I don't bother to reposition them, they do not wiggle so much they feel like they will fall out.  I never worry about that.  They still stay solid enough in my ear that the seal stays and music sounds good.  Getting the right tip is important.  I'm really just referring here to the way the body feels on my ear, not how the tip stays in my ear.- As others have said, battery life, fit, and sound is awesome.  Can't add more.- Wind noise:  Yes, if you run in these there will be wind noise.  Sprints make noise like crazy.  But this is basic physics.  You shouldn't have any other expectations for buds of this style.  They stick out to the sides and are not at all aerodynamic.  My friend with the Beats in this style says they do the same.  In another review, a SENSO rep states you should make sure they are sealed properly.  I have been wearing in-ear monitors for 14 years.  I know for certain I have mine sealed properly and am using the right tips.  That will not help.  Again, this is physics.  Those boxes sticking out from your ears WILL make wind noise and that noise WILL transfer to your ears.  This is unavoidable.  If you are primarily running, these aren't the buds for you.  In my experience, low-profile, wired earbuds do great for running.  Even if you get bluetooth for running, I can't see why you would need this much grip.  I have never once had earbuds fall out only due to running.  I need something like this for active workouts in a gym.  I'm not really sure there is a great single solution for both.  That type with the wing that goes in your ear might work for both, but I fear the wing will cause my ear to hurt.

From workout to shower to work to travel


I would buy them again...and almost had to. I had them for two months, took one out and it broke apart. They weren't eligible for return through Amazon so I thought I might have to buy them again but then I noticed that they had a one year defect warranty. I contacted the main company's support team and within a day, they sent a replacement. They were very nice and the replacement process was smooth.About the headphones: I love how noise-cancelling these headphones are. I wear them on planes and I don't hear any external noise.I go straight from the workout to the shower with them. I don't run them under the water or anything but a little splash doesn't seem to damage them.I'm a short distance jogger and they stay in my ears. They are comfortable too. I wear them for hours at a time and I have even slept in them before.I didn't want to spend the money to buy them again but I would :)

Fantastic value, robust


I have had these for 6 months and have used them pretty regularly.  The sound quality and fit is very good for their size and in particular, their cost.  They readily connect to my iPhone 6 every time.  The earbuds do a great job isolating outside noise...the sound comes through clear through the wind noise when I am biking.  The battery is nicely sized as I can use these for a good number of workouts and rides before needing to recharge.The sweatproofing works very well -- I inadvertently put these through the washer when I left them in the pocket of my biking shorts.  Once the unit dried I could not detect a dropoff in sound quality, connectivity, or battery life.  The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the cord will swing up and catch on a shoulder as I run or ride which creates an unbalanced feeling.  The headphones feel very comfortable when the cord hangs behind my neck.All in all, for $10 more than wired earbuds from Apple that hang from your ears you really can't beat these!

Nice, high quality earpiece headphones - bluetooth


Once these earphones finally arrived (Amazon lost them somehow but did refund the order and express shipped another) I quickly paired them with my Motorola Droid Turbo 64, a phone notorious for it's low volume on audio/video playback, I played some classic Pink Floyd to really test them out.  They passed with flying colors.  Light weight, comfortable to wear, controls easy to use, as was pairing, voice confirmation of commands.  All in all, I found them to be better than I expected.  Note:  I've not tried a phone call through them yet, but I'll update this review if it's not as good as the basic audio/video delivery.They also come with a nice little hardshell case to store them in and various wire connections along with 3 sets of ear pieces, small, medium and large.  Mine came with the large installed and those were quite comfortable.  They appear to be made out of that spongy material that disposable earplugs are made out of so they conform to the unique shape of your ear.

Ehh..Bluetooth connectivity issue


I’ve been using this headphone a couple times a week during my commute for about a month.Brought this after my friend recommend this brand.At first the headphone was great.  But now I get connectivity issues.  For an example, I would hear the confirmation that “the headphones are now connected” (if my bluetooth is on when I power on the headphones) but it will not connect to my phone until a minute later or more, or until i go to my phone settings to manually connect.  Sometimes I have to restart the headphones several times.Sometimes the volume buttons don’t work and I would have to change the volume using my phone. Sometimes the buttons do work, but I will have to press super hard.I really don’t have any other headphones to compare to as this is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. My friend doesn’t have any issues with her headphones but that maybe because she has the older version.

I own a good blue tooth headset but the bulk around the neck ...


The price was right -on sale! I own a good blue tooth headset but the bulk around the neck was getting uncomfortable with some health gear that I must carry.  The Senso seems to be a good choice but I'm going to use the slider that come with strap to pin the headset to my clothes.  It is so lightweight I am afraid I will not feel it if it comes off.  The sound is a tiny bit tinny it is not bad. The on and off function is a bit fickle and sometimes requires multiple attempts to turn the earphones on or off.One drawback is that there were virtually no instructions with the headset. Fortunately its operation is fairly intuitive. It did not say how you can make a phone call. I discovered that if I said Okay Google and then stated person's name with the word ""call"" before it works better than the other headset.  It also would have been helpful if there were directions with the 3 ft cord.  I discovered that there was a slider thst when pulled would reveal the connector to an android  phone.  I will probably go to the manufacturer's website and see if I can find comprehensive instructions.

Overall a great product!


These ear buds are exactly what you hope they would be. They are comfortable and do their job great for their price point.Pros: LOVE the soft cord to go around the back of your head. They are comfortable on the ears and you don't have to worry about adjusting them mid-run.The buttons are easy to find and clear instructions for how to set them up/work them.They come in a nice, hard-shell case to keep them safe and to find quickly in your gym bag or purse.Sound was crisp and clear!Cons: You get what you pay for. I'm super pleased with these for the discounted price of $30 when purchased through my Prime account. They do not cancel outside sound so in the gym (I think you'd need full headphones for that quality) I did need them up to the second from max volume to hear what I was working out to. I think they will be perfect for outdoor running though.Overall, whatever can make my working out easier and more enjoyable so I want to go to the gym or go for a run, is awesome. These are great little buds!

Low priced for entry level.  They do everything I need them to do!


They fit great, with plenty of range and battery life.  I have used them for 6-7 hrs at a time.  The only trouble I have had, and it doesn’t bother much yet.  The small ear plugs that go into your ear, that you listen thru.  They sometimes come loose and have to be screwed back into earpiece.  They have really small wires attaching them to headphones.  I’m afraid they might break.  I probably will glue them.  The Bluetooth connects super.  Answering phone calls is good and up and down volume is easily learned.One problem I have had is that the little hearing tubes that go in your ear come unscrewed.  I needed to glue one tube back in because it broke off the ear piece.  They doo sound as good as I like and do not fall off or out of ears.

You get what you paid for.


So far used it for a month. I wear it when I run for ~30 min everyday, on 10-25% volume, hooked up to my iPhone SE that is in one of those armbands. Overall not impressed, but I feel like I got my money's worth.Pros:Clear sound - I'm no audiophile, but I can tell there's an improvement in quality over the cheap bluetooth earbuds I bought in the $10-20 range.Decent battery life - recharge every 2 weeks, so i guess 6-7 hours of battery life on that volume.Easy controls - no buttons have broken yetStays on your year - haven't had issues with the earpiece falling offFast chargetimeCons:Weak signal - The on/off is in the right earpiece, so I guess the bluetooth hardware is there too... If i wear my armband on my left (opposite) arm, the music will often stutter. When I wear the armband on my right arm so it's close to the earpiece, almost no issues. Support told me it's something about resetting the pairing, but I think it's a hardware issue.Poor low battery indicator - The ""Low Battery"" voice will pop up about 2 minutes before the battery runs out. I went out for a run yesterday, and in the beginning of the run I heard ""Low Battery""... and the earbuds powered off 2 minutes later.

Average price - Average performance


Decent price, sub average performance.  I have used these a month, they barely meet expectations. The rubber ear brace is too flexible, gives no real support so when the very thin (and easily breakable) middle cable (or any small vibration) jogs the earpiece- it comes loose or falls out, you lose the sound level and hear the noise around you. When you adjust the ear phone on the right - you will inevitably bump the power on button and stop the audio, so you have to be careful not to touch the button built into the base or this will be a problem. Sound is ok, and battery retention is very good.  Peeps say tgey can hear me fine, and vice versa. Get rid of the rubbery ear brace and these are winners for the price.  )3/31/17UPDATE: I had power on button fail  with the phones + Cathy at Senso support sent me a replacement pair lickity split. They have been working for 3 weeks so far so good.  Overall, these phones are ok for the price, I am getting used to them so I upgraded my review to 3 stars from 2- if amazon lets me.

Comfortable and works great!


I did so much research and read so many reviews.  I needed something that would allow me to work hands free around the office and construction sites.  I first tried the Plantronics Voyager but although it functioned perfectly and I liked the voice controls, it was very uncomfortable no matter what configuration I tried.  And it was so small it was easy to lose.I also tried the Plantronics Back Beat Fit but the design is just ridiculous with parts that won't stay on, it takes 10 minutes to try to situate it properly in my ears, it wouldn't pair with my Galaxy Note 8, and I don't have time for problems.  I need solutions to problems and I'm busy.  I really was hung up on the Plantronics name but it just doesn't' work for me.So I tried this less expensive Senso Invotek model and it works great! It's comfortable and has great stereo sound quality.  The controls are simple and easy to use.  While it doesn't have some of the bells and whistles I liked in the Voyager, and it makes me look like a bolt-head, it does have all I need and I don't care what it looks like if it works.  It stays in my ears and allows me to answer the darn phone hand free while I'm working.  Thank you very much.

I have been using these earbuds for almost a year. I am generally happy with them and use them primarily for listening to audio-books during my commute on the bus. I do think they are a great value. A friend spent 5 times as much on a pair of Beats that look/perform/sound almost identical. Some pros and cons:PROs:Very good sound, deep baseEasy to pair with my iPhone 7 PlusComfortable in the earEasily start and stop your audio with button on the right earpieceCONs:Battery life is definitely shorter than advertised. I get about 4 to 4 1/2  hours.I do get skipping audio at times. Not sure the cause - could just be a Bluetooth thing.Not really a flaw - but I do wish there was a a way to plug them into the phone directly when the battery dies

Basic Earbud


It's ugly, clunky (large) but functional.  A lot more awkward than the ones that just drop into the ""pod chargers"", but that also lack the over-ear hook which is what I was trying to get.  Don't think I'd recommend it, but it's been doing what I needed it to do.

Good for the Basic Exerciser


Good sound quality for music. I intended to use the headphones for listening to workout videos. I live with other people so it would have been nice to be able to workout without disturbing others. When connecting the headphones it caused interference with wifi to the point of wifi just stop working. I emailed the company for these were my first set of bluetooth headphones. They said that I need to switch to a more stable network and it was not the headphones interfering with the wifi. I am not well versed in technology so I was not able to change the wifi setting to make it more stable even though I pay for high speed and quality internet. I also noticed that the piece that goes over the ear can be bent out of shape real easily.Best for people who use the headphones for just listening to music. These did not fall out when doing my pilates, did require readustment when doing HIIT workouts.

If you contemplating these after reading reviews - trust me. Look further , Spend more


First pair stopped charging within 5 months. Sebastian at Senso as many ppl have mentioned in their reviews was great and they replaced the unit after weeks of waiting. Those burned while charging. I thought it was my wife who was cooking on the stove  too close to them.. assuming it could have been human error I ordered them again because you can’t beat the sound volume and charge time for 20 bucks. This new pair lasted one charge that they came with and then one more charge at home. As soon as the battery was dying I charged them again and when I went to use them again they had not charged nor could not be charged. Completely dead. Tried everything. I contacted amazon who listened to my experience and are shipping me a new pair overnight even though I’m passed the 30 day return and I told them that Senso take weeks to replace them.... i get it... 20 bucks or so is not that much and so we can only expect so much, but now every pair so far has stopped working well within the first 6 months... it would be better to just advertise them as the 20 buck Bluetooth headphones - you will most likely get your 20 bucks worth.... it’s crazy how many they have sold and how many reviews there are .... I assumed that so many positive reviews and qtys sold they would work and would be happy to buy a pair annually as I use them for the peloton only... it’s a sad world that all this fancy marketing and the amazon algorithm creates false value. They are just junk guys.... so what’s the answer? Spend 50 bucks, spend 70 bucks or spend 150 to 200 and get a branded name to which there are too many to list.... I don’t want to damage my AirPod pros or lose them while riding outdoors but will a pair that costs somewhere in the middle last longer than these ones? In the end rather attempt to find out with a slightly more expensive pair than this because as much as I want to see these work on the 4th pair something tells me they won’t.... you get what you pay for.... simple as that....

FANTASTIC for the money


Bought these because I didn't want to spend the money for apple's bluetooth EarPods. They're a little big, but they connect well, have a very decent range and the battery lasts. Normally, I'll recharge overnight or first thing in the morning and they'll go all day without recharging. The sound quality is pretty awesome. I used to love apple's earbuds quality and normally listen to music, podcasts, youtube, audiobooks, sermons, etc. I'm currently using the red foam inserts rather than the black silicone ones. They seem to seal better for my ears and are more comfortable throughout the day.I'll use these with my phone whether I'm working at my computer, building a shed or mowing the lawn. They work great.

Durable, reliable, great for exercising


I have now had these for 2.5 years, and last night I accidentally ran them through the washer and dryer, and this morning they still worked perfectly! The connectivity is not always perfect when I go on runs with them, but the battery life is great - I can usually exercise about 5-7 times between charges. I’m not much of a sound-quality snob, so I can’t say much for that, but they are good enough for someone like me who just wants music during exercise. I would absolutely buy them again.

good build quality


Pro: good build quality, relatively comfortable to wear, good sound for the price, nice if somewhat bulky case.Cons: Since they are very sound isolating you can hear yourself breathe if music is at low volume and eat (don't try hard pretzels, LOL), when it's even a bit windy outside you get a lot of wind noise (imagine blowing into a microphone). Stronger wind will pretty much listening to music impossible. The cable connecting the two is coated with a sticky rubber, if you get even a bit sweaty on your neck it sticks and if you move your head one side will fall out of your ear. At lower volume you can also hear the cable rubbing against your clothing.All in all good quality for around the house, at work, etc, but definitely not for jogging/biking/hiking or watching TV and eating some crunchy snacks. All in all I would not buy them again. I'd give 2.5 stars if that were an option.

Excellent, good quality headphones at a great price!


Excellent headphones!  I switched from a high end over the ear corded and going to these I feel like I have my life back LOL.  I use them for the treadmill and other machines at the gym.  I listen to music or watch movies on my tablet.  It is nice to have good, inexpensive Bluetooth headphones that work well so I don't have to worry about ""running over"" my phone or tablet while on the treadmill.  I have been able to start running as well, without worry.  The only thing that I don't like is that if there is a loud speaker playing music, over my head at the gym, I find it hard to hear MY music or movie.  But, I think that is just what we have to deal with when it comes to Bluetooth headphones.  They are not going to be as loud.  I don't fault these headphones, I fault for gym for blasting the music too loud.  LOL

My Quest for Bluetooth Headphones - Completed


I have gone through so many Bluetooth headphones; I seriously have a collection. I'm very specific with how the headphones fit into my ears (I've got pretty small ears) and I've found that most headphones tend to fall out super easily. This especially gets annoying when my primary use of these is for the gym. So I was on the lookout for a new pair of Bluetooth headphones after I lost my other favorite pair. I took a chance with these and I'm so glad I did! Not only are the default ""gummies"" on these fit perfectly, but the sound is superb for its price. I usually spend 1.5 hours at 4 days a week, and I usually only have to charge them by the 4th day. Also, the extra accessories are just a steal for the price.If you don't want to shell out too much money for a pair of headphones, then grab these as they are definitely worth it.

Decent sound, but....


These Senso wireless earbuds had surprisingly good sound for such an inexpensive item. They were so loud, in fact, that I actually kept the volume on my iPod turned down to the minimum while I used these for working out. That said, I always found the flat cable between them a little awkward, as it would never lay flat and always seemed to want to move to one side or another. It also, because of the nature of it being flat, would hold the shape from having been in the (nice) hard case, which also prevented it laying flat.The most disappointing thing was that, after less than a year of use, it suddenly started just skipping songs randomly. A song would start, and just a few seconds in, my iPod would jump to the next song, as if I had pressed the button on the right earbud. It would sometimes do this multiple times in a row and then stop on its own. As well, the volume up button on the earbud now seemed stuck (and I don't abuse these - just normal use during workouts) so that it doesn't press in or click like the volume down button does. Unfortunately, customer support was even more disappointing. I contacted them in November and they promptly replied apologizing for the trouble and asking for pictures to be passed on to the warranty department. I sent the pictures the same day and have not been able to get a response from anyone there since. Needless to say, I will not be recommending nor buying any Senso products in the future.

Affordable and easy to use


I received my Senso headphones two days after ordering through prime.  I like that they include various sizes of ear buds, a nice hard case to protect them and easy to follow instructions.  What I love about them,  along with a very affordable price,  is how easy they are to charge.  There's a charging port located on the right ear piece  that I charge using my cell phone and tablet chargers.  Connecting to Bluetooth was fast and easy with my phone and tablet. They hold a charge for a very long time and will fully charge using my lenova tablet charger in under an hour.  What I dislike - they are too big for me so not as securely attached (although I've gotten used to it and haven't had them fall off) - the small earbuds are tiny, even for my small ears and the medium which came attached are a little larger than average size earbuds but I did get used to this as well. I do recommend buying for the low price they really work great!  These are my first wireless Bluetooth headphones and I'm satisfied, only took off one star due to the large size of the medium ear buds and large not completely secured to my ear back piece to hold in place.

Very good product.


So far this is a very good product.  The only thing that I have had a minor problem with is hitting the button accidentally while trying to adjust the buds in my ear.  But it is ok if I am careful.  I really like the changeable ear clips.  You can mold them around your ears.  Not a one size fits all thing. So that if you ears are unorthodox, you can make it work with this product.  I use them now every time that I go to the gym.  The sound quality is excellent.  I also like the case.  I have a lanyard that I attach to the zipper and I can keep my earbuds attached to my belt so as not to lose them.  This is a solid, well made good quality product.  And the price was very reasonable.  I would recommend them to anyone.

Won't Pair with Nike+ Apple Watch(Series 2): Avoid


Using with Series 2 Apple Watch, really poor bluetooth connection, Apple Watch on my left wrist and the signal is having difficulty getting to the headphones. . . so I guess it's antenna is on the right ear piece? Sound is constantly going in and out. They only pair with my Apple Watch if the watch is power-cycled(power watch off, then back on). They are not recognized by the Apple Watch otherwise. I'm curious as to how these headphones are so highly rated. Not a very good value imo. These should pair and stay paired. However, once they are powered off, they will not re-pair with the Apple Watch unless the watch is again power-cycled. I'm outside the return window so I'm stuck with them. Frustrating.*update*Performed factory reset, as recommended by Invotek CS rep in reply section. No change in pairing procedure. Headphones will only pair if Apple Watch is power-cycled.

Greta product  - especially at this price


After my favorite ""Blayz"" headphones "" stopped being available, I decided to try the Senso - as they seemed very similar.I would say 90-95% as good as the Blayz, which is quite a feat for a sub $20.00 pair.I haven't tested the 8 hour Battery time, but for sure 5 hours, and they rarely miss a beat. Sound over Voice calls and Skype are excellent. Good Base, could be better on the High's. Very comfortable - A winner!So Much better than any of those ""Ear-Bud"" systems. My sons who use The Apple AirPods are amazed at the sound these produce, but they just aren't as ""cool"" as the Ear Bud/style  they say.I'l go for sound and quality!

they will be chipping in and out so it's best to connect to one at a time


You can connect to two devices at once. However, they will be chipping in and out so it's best to connect to one at a time. I was trying to connect to my phone and my laptop at the same time incase I got a call I could just answer. I just use one at a time and even when I'm connected to the phone alone, the connection is poor. The person on the other line always says I'm chipping in and out so I've just stopped using it for anything but listening.I just don't have to really deal with it getting tangled which is the main reason I got these. Also, be able to just get up and walk around without worrying about forgetting I have headphones in and my phone falling.It stays connected within a certain range and reconnects if you happen to step out of that range then come back.Tells you when the battery is low.Comes with a cute little case that comes in very very handy.I would give it a B. Not A+ but it does the job minus using it to take calls.

Total crap


I’ve used them like five times. Invariably, either they don’t stay charged, or they just don’t turn on no matter how many days they’ve been on the charger. Or they just don’t connect to my phone. They are so unreliable it’s impossible to use them without also having regular headphones as a back up. I wish I could return them.

250 vs. 255


I have owned both the 250 and 255 models.  If your into more crisp mids and highs, go with the 255's.  If you like a little more richer bass, the 250's are you ticket.  They are both amazing pieces, would and will buy again.  A pair of mine got sent through the washer and have stopped working.  I work all day so having two pair, one on the charger is really nice.  Always switching between the two models I have developed an ear to see their difference.  If I had to choose I would find a 250 over the 255.  If you scroll down after all the pictures it will say whether you are looking at the 250 or 255.

Great For Music, but not so much for talking.


Customer Service: 5 StarsHeadphones: 5 Stars for Music, 3 Stars for TalkIncluded bonuses:Car Charger: 5 StarsCharging cord (converts into either micro-usb or apple): 5 StarsDETAILS:I bought this back in March 2017 primarily for music. These have pretty decent bass quality when using both sides of the headphones with the right size buds. In July, the left side decided to stop working. I called Customer service and they tried helping me reset, then when that didn't work, they told me they'd replace it. That was around 10pm Thursday night. I got the new headphones free Saturday. TWO DAYS!! Talk about good service! In addition, I didn't have to wait on the phone, and the conversation was maybe 10 minutes tops because of problems on my end. If it wasn't for that, it could've easily been 5 minutes or less.The new headphones have some improvements over the old ones. Firstly, they come with a new type of foam earbud in addition to their previous rubber-like ones. These buds are superior in comfort and sound cancellation.Secondly, the batteries supposedly last longer and charge quicker, however, I have not tested that as of this review. EDIT: The charge time is still 2 hours. I have not noticed longer battery time.Does it work as advertised?Well, the old ones advertised 7 hours play time and 1-2 hours charge time. They actually lasted about 7 hours and charged for 2 hours. The charge time was long, but it was nice that they lasted as long as advertised.Range: Moderate quality. Both my coworker and I have these. Your quality of range will depend on the source of the music (presumably your phone). Different phones have different generations of bluetooth and will offer differences in range. We have tested a few different phones and ranges. I can go anywhere in my two-bedroom apartment with doors closed and be fine. I can go a decent distance in open area with nothing blocking the line of sight. Overall, I was impressed as I wasn't expecting quite so much range on these.Other Pros: The volume/skip buttons are very easy to find and use, as is the power button.Sweat really doesn't seem to bother them.They stay in without issue in all sorts of activities.Cons: These advertise for music, and they're great for that, but if you use them for talking on the phone, I'd only give this product 3 stars. I can hear with amazing sound and clarity anyone on the other side, depending only on their connection. HOWEVER, they cannot hear me as well. The mic is very soft and somewhat muffled. This does not defer based on your source.Another minor issue is the blue ""connected"" LED light that flashes every couple seconds. In the dark, especially if you use headphones while driving, this has the potential to be distracting.In addition, the first pair did fail on me. Of course, it was replaced quickly without issues.In Summary,These are great bluetooth headphones for music with good quality and a reasonable price tag, however, I would not recommend these to use primarily for phone conversations.

Device connectivity is terrible


Pros:-The sound quality is pretty good, very clear and pretty good outside noise suppression-customer support is okCons:-Ear hooks are too big, just me sitting in a chair can cause the ear buds to fall out which is BS.-The connectivity of the device is not good I cant even put my phone in my pocket and still get a good signal. 1 foot from my hip is when signal gets bad. They could have spent more money on the reception instead of getting a short charging cable when there is the multi functional charging cable already and a car charging port.-That case that they give you is a waste of money.Barely has enough space for the charging cable and extra earbud caps.Honestly a better deal to go to a store and get 5$ headphones. Amazon if your reading this I want a REFUND!!!

Terrific buy!  Waterproof, mud proof, sound good and stay in place.


I have been very impressed with the durability and sound of these headphones.  I bought them because I wanted a headphone that would stay put and sound great with good bass while running, climbing, jumping, sweating, etc.  These have not failed me.  I have run 3 obstacle races (Spartan Super, ToughMudder and Spartan Beast) while using these headphones.  In all 3 races they have been submerged in muddy water, gotten sweaty and rained on and have continued working. During the Beast they got really muddy and I simply washed them off and they continued to work fine. They stayed in place while traversing the various walls, pits, etc.  The battery life is good and the sound quality great considering the price.  I have not had any trouble pairing them with my iPhone 7 or Windows 10 laptop.  I recommend them to everyone.  You will not be disappointed!

Good buy, long life


I really like these, especially the increased battery life. My old Bluetooth earbuds were nice, but they only lasted three hours on a charge. These purport to be able to go eight hours, though I have yet to test that out. Of course, the limits of rechargeable battery technology means that these are a bit heavier than my old ones, but the weight is well-balanced and does not feel burdensome. All in all, a fine pair of earbuds. And they sound good, too!Update: these lay claim to eight hours of continuous play on one charge, so I decided to do my own experiment. I tracked all my use, which was decidedly NOT continuous (an hour here, 30 minutes there, ten minutes another time) and on one charge they actually lasted for a total of TEN hours. I was very pleased with these already, and this just cements it. Really first rate.

Disappointed


I purchased this item on May 2.I used it at work and workouts, gentle treatment and about 2 hours per day 5 days per week.  Charging was fine, Bluetooth stayed engaged around 15 feet and through a closed door. Controls were fine after a little time getting used to them.June 22, one of the earbuds broke from the earpiece and is dangling by a single wire.Return window closed on June 1, so I got 7 weeks of use before it broke. I'm an adult, did not treat them roughly at all and probably treated them more gently than average.Very disappointed with the lack of durability.  The simple act of inserting and removing the headphones shouldn't ruin them in 7 weeks.I can not recommend this item, search for something with better durability.

Bad reception


I ordered these because I lost my LGs, now I regret it. The sound is good, especially for $40 bucks. The problem,  I cant step more than five feet away without the damn signal breaking up. While at the gym, if I do inclined sit ups,  breaks up signal, if I am doing planks, and phone is on my left side, signal is choppy. If the phone is at my feet and I lay on my back, signal breaks up.  It comes with a wallet sticky for the back of your phone, a carrying case, and a nifty sticky magnet so you can mount it on your dashboard, mounts with sticky tape (metal is about the size of a quarter). The truth is, if you want to lay in bed, sit in a chair and stay put,  GREAT!  If you're planning on purchasing for GYM, don't waste your time.  I will be returning them if its not too late.  To better describe the issue, it sounds like a scratched CD or CD player with no anti-skip. ANNOYING as F***!

Gym Headphones


I purchased these so I could listen to classical music at the gym. So far I've just used them at home; the gym test comes tomorrow AM.  So far they pair well with my iPhone and the audio quality is the same as or better than the hardwire headphones.  I have one suggestion.  The R and L indications are so small that many may miss them.  I would suggest taking a clue from the hearing aid manufacturers and coloring the right earpiece red and the left one blue (like the political parties).(added).  After a week, I really like the headphones.  There is a problem at the gym in that their wi-fi cuts in and out so I don't get the music streaming that I want.  I now use them at home to watch TV.After using them for a few months, the on/off switch broke. Not having read the warranty, I purchased a new pair. I read the warranty that came with the new pair and contacted the vendor.  After asking me to perform a quick test (which failed) they sent me a new pair of headphones.  The customer service is terrific

Not for smaller/petite ears


I was inspired by the abundance of positive reviews and purchased these headphones. They were my first wireless set. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to hear the sound quality, as they simply wouldn't stay put. I'm not talking about the ear buds (there are various bud sizes included), rather the attachment that loops around each ear. There is only one size available, and it is not meant for smaller ears. I couldn't even walk across the room without it sliding off. Additionally, the placement of the on/off/volume controls were on the earpiece, which was awkward. Needless to say, I had to return the unit, and went for the Anker brand ones (which both fit and are fabulous). To the company's credit, the packaging was nice, the unit had numerous accessories and the return process was a breeze. They just weren't the right headphones for me.

Nearly “perfect” (for the price) with one annoying charging flaw


These headphone far surpass my expectations.  Very good sound quality, good fit, zero chance of them falling out, easy Bluetooth pairing.  Only issue:  The little rubber charging flap’s gripper is too small...you can’t get a grasp to open the USB charging flap without getting a pair of tweezers.  Very Very annoying...I’m tempted to just rip the cover off since I’m not going to be running with these in the rain or take them into the shower.  I now own two of these and both have the same flaw so it’s unlikely a single product aberration.  If it weren’t for that issue, it would have gotten a clear 5-stars for the price.  Now, I don’t know about the longevity, but for what I paid, if this lasts a year I’ll be happy.

2 years later


I’ve had these for two years, and I still use them often. I use them mowing the lawn, at the gym, and around the house. They’re a very good inexpensive option that offers good quality for the price. They don’t have “noise cancel” but other noise is definitely reduced when these are in your ears somewhat like earplugs. They include different sizes for your ears. The charging cord included is very short and lost easily but a universal cord works just fine. You cannot charge them and use them at the same time but I’m sure that’s normal. Whenever I take calls with them on the audio doesn’t seem quite as clear as a music app. I’d buy them again.

Short charge time for long use


Upside: Short charge time make these headphones almost immediately available.  It takes about 30 minutes and the charge lasts for 8 hours.  The instructions specifically say not to over charge them (do not leave on charger over night) as this may cause the charge to be lesser time.It takes a little getting used to as far as the buttons on the headphone because you can use them to answer and make phone calls, sift through your playlist and adjust the volume. There is a 30 foot range on the blue tooth. There are 3 different ear bud sizes.  I use the small ones, but I still think even a smaller ear bud would work better for me - I guess I have small ears.Downside: they are a little bulky; the charge cord is super short

Fair for the price


You get what you pay for. Not perfect.  Sound is excellent, as well as range. Will go out if I get ~25ft away from device. I'm in Oklahoma right now. As far as wind goes, if it's just more than breezy and you're head-first into the wind, it's so loud that it will drown out the music. If you're in a phone call, same issue, and the other person can hear it. Wind hitting the side of your face is much less disruptive. They're a little large, so they barely hold onto my ears and can rotate a little. You can't let the buds suction into your ear or you will hear every foot step. So sometimes I find I have to tug the cord a little when my sweat makes it slide in. I like that there's extra buds and a charge cord. I have long, heavy hair so my pony tail will tug at the cord behind my neck and can pull on the buds.

If you want to put your phone in your pocket and listen to music, don't get these.


I had purchased these for both my wife and I and after about 5 months of operating, I can say I've never made a worse purchase in my life. Well, maybe one or two others but as of recent these things are hot trash. Maybe it says somewhere on the product description and I missed it, but the bluetooth connectivity on these is about a foot. So, if you plan on wearing these headphones and putting the phone in your pocket, good luck as it won't pick up the reception. If you hold the phone close to your ear or leave it on your nightstand while you sleep, maybe you'll be good but for what I purchased these for - working out - they can't do the job. Also, there's only 3 buttons on this: volume and a ""connection button."" You press the button, it does nothing, you hold it down, it turns it on and off. Trying to get them connected within that 1ft range to new devices can be a pain.Now, I will give them some pros and say that the sound quality when it is connected is fine. No deep bass issues or anything, not crystal clear, it's just fine. It get's the job done you know.In addition, being able to charge with a micro usb is good and the over the ear setup works and the adjustable ear plugs are good. The length of the headphone wire between buds is a little comical and I don't think it's very well thought out.Also, I realize you get what you pay for, but after reading the reviews I figured these would be an ok pair, just for the gym you know, nothing fancy. But, nah. I'd rather just spend 2x the amount for headphones that work, so if you know someone selling some, let me know!Thanks...

Battery lasts a long time./Noise Cancelling is great. I've fallen asleep with them on using private listening w/ my Roku TV to block out my husbands snoring, which works great. I still have more than 50% battery life the next morning. This is my second pair only because I couldn't find my last pair. But now I have two, one for workouts and one for private listening.

Great product, great price!


It is hard to believe this great deal until you receive it. It is a great bluetooth for the price and it comes with a lot of great accessories. I was going to buy Beats headphone but I did some research and thought it would be waaaay cheaper to buy this and the Sony Headphone Model #MDRXB450AP than buying one very expensive Beats Headphone. So I did that and I am very satisfied with my purchases. I now use this great SENSO Bluetooth Headphones and when it needs to get recharge I use my Sony Headphone. Both great prices and works great. You will not be disappointed if you go with this one. Works just like the expensive headphones and it comes with warranty!7/7/2017 Review: My headphone stopped working yesterday unfortunately and it's probably the result of using it all day everyday. The best thing is I called their customer service and they were very helpful and very willing to send me a replacement because of the one year warranty. Thank you for making great products and for your exceptional customer service!Update July 29 2021: I am still using the replacement I was sent when my first one stopped working on 7/7/2017. I can't believe how it is still working with my 3 years old throwing it around and playing with it all the time. I am here to buy another one. You can't beat this price and how good it works.

Gave me a solid 3 years of service, couldn't be happier


I exercise every other day, religiously, for about an hour and a half. So roughly, that's 3.5 days out of a week, for a total of about 5.25 hrs a week. With roughly 52 weeks in a year, I used these headphones for 273 hrs in a year for the gym alone. After roughly 819 gym hours (three years) and who knows how many hours outside of the gym, I've finally lost connection to the left ear. These earbuds survived extensive phone calls, music & video watching, and sweaty thrashings (that is accompanied by an intense workout). I can't speak for other people's experiences, but these earbuds have served me quite well and I couldn't have been happier. I think I'll buy another pair too!

The sound is great too! Good amount of bass without drowning out ...


Worth every penny. First off I was won over by a review from Cubichi. She was very thorough with her review. I have wanted something to workout in the gym with. I wasn't gonna spend all that money for Beats etc. So after reading her review I decided to give them a try. With prime they were ordered on a Friday evening and delivered on a Sunday afternoon. To be honest I didn't explore all the extra ear buds I just wanted to see how they sounded. Let me say they feel secure when warn and stay in place. The sound is great too! Good amount of bass without drowning out the highs. All around great sound for price. They come with a car charger, extra earbuds, some micro USB cord and cool case. Which is great for throwing it my gym bad. I'm over all impressed with the quality for the price. Now it's only been about 5 days so it remains to be seen how well they hold up.P.S. they were charged when they arrived and snyced to my Android phone in seconds. I only use them about and hour at a time and on day five was my first day charging them. They were still going strong but i just figured it was time to charge them.

No Noice Cancellation, Poor Bluetooth Connectivity


I bought these to wear when bike riding and mowing the lawn as they are advertised as being ""noise-canceling"".  There is absolutely no difference in background noise whether they are on or off.  The only way I can hear anything on my lawn tractor is to turn up the volume so loud it drowns out the mower which I doubt is healthy for my hearing!  Wind noise while riding my bike is similarly the same whether the headset is turned on or off.  These are very comfortable though and for the price I suppose I was being overly optimistic to expect they would provide decent noise cancellation.  Still, the manufacturer shouldn't advertise this capability as it simply doesn't work - if it even has it in the first place.  I also find the Bluetooth connectivity to be poor.  With my iPhone on the desk next to me it's fine but just putting my phone in my pants pocket is enough to cause the connection to break up frequently.  Once again, I guess you get what you pay for.

Battery not reliable. After each charge, I would hear BATTERY LOW and after 10 minutes the SENSO shuts down.


I wrote the message below and within a day was contacted by SENSO via email. The technician wanted to address the problem. We attempted a reboot of the headphones. It didn't work. But SENSO acknowledged my warranty and followed with a replacement SENSO. I am delighted with the response and quick attempt to solve my problem. Better yet - I am getting a replacement. Great service.I purchased these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones in June 2017. I was very pleased with the fit and sound. It connected easily to my IPhone and iPad mini four. Within 6 months the headphones would warn me within a half hour BATTERY LOW. I would re-charge and hear BATTERY LOW with 15 minutes. I didn’t do anything at the time because I ordered MPOW Bluetooth headphones that looked and felt the same as my SENSO. My MPOW has worked well. The two headphones look the same, feel the same, operate the same. BUT - I am sorry to say that the SENSO is not reliable.

Great gym headphone and tremendous customer care


I've had these for about ten months. I use them at the gym and when reading as the loud coffee shop on campus. At the gym, they work great, though there are moments when they randomly cut out even though I'm only a few feet away. This happens very rarely though. At the coffee shop, they do a relatively good job of cutting out outside noise and the music of the shop. Though I've been impressed with them, I never felt compelled to write a review for them... until today.A few days ago the left earphone stopped working (this is probably partially due to how I throw them around and in my gym bag, as well the normal beating they take at the gym). I emailed Senso customer care and they provided a troubleshooting method that did not work. Since the headphones come with a year-long warranty though, they sent me a new pair. They did not even ask for the old pair back! I was so impressed with the quickness of customer care's response, and the ease of solving the issues, that I had to write a review.Top notch company and product! I would recommend these headphones to anyone!

two dead sets in a year - not recommended for working out


i ride my bike and work out with these wireless headphones. i sweat a lot. i tried my best to keep these clear of sweat and water, and i don't know if that was the cause of their demise, but it's the only thing i can think of. my first pair would still turn on, but would never pair with anything. my second pair just stopped turning on completely, even though it would charge.these things are cheap, and probably would be good for light use, like if you're just sitting around in bed or something. they're branded as ""sports earphones"" - but on my bike, the wind rips through these things and it's hard to hear. also, the connection was spotty even though my phone was in my pocket. at the gym, they were fine, although i didn't like the cable bouncing up and down - for the price i was ok with this.the sound quality is pretty good for what you pay for. probably the best thing about the headphones. while support is great and they sent me a replacement set, i think i'm done with these things. i need something more reliable and probably of higher build quality.i'm skeptical of these being ""sweatproof"" because the manual says quite a lot about keeping the device free of sweat and water. if they are - then why did they die after only a few months of use? whatever the reason, it's  probably not worth it if you're interested in wireless headphones for the gym.

Poor sound quality and strong wind noise


I've had these headphones for more than a year now. I use them extensively because I spent $30 on them and I want my money's worth out of it. They're also my only wireless headphones. Anyways, on to the review.Running with these headphones are uncomfortable because the buds slide out of the ear despite the device being wrapped around the outside of the ear. When running, wind noise is a HUGE problem and drowns out the music. I have not found a way to fix this -- different sized buds do not help. I did not expect it to be noise cancelling, but it is not noise reducing at all. As for the sound quality, it is garbage. It is muffled and the bass and treble I feel are what I expect $10 headphones would be. It connects to Bluetooth pretty easily, but sound cuts in and out at random times making me stop my workout to fix it. I personally do not think this device is worth the money, nor would I gift it to others. I'll be using this until it breaks or I can't bear the poor sound quality.

These used to be my favorite headphones - but ...


I bought a pair of these headphones almost 2 years ago. I loved them. They replaced the plug-in headphones that I had been using, and I so loved losing the cord. The sound quality was good and the battery lasted long enough between recharges that, unless I forgot to charge them, it was not an issue. However, I loved that pair to death, and when the connection between the two sides died, I asked for and received a new pair as a present.In most ways the new set is as good as the old, but there is now one irritating problem. The new set has different material (they call it ""memory metal"") in the thin, flexible ear-hooks that hold these on your ear. However, the ear hooks are now too flexible. They don't hold their shape well and so the earbuds start to come out. I am constantly having to reach up and try to readjust the earbuds or rebend the ear-hooks to try to hold the earbuds in place better. Now these headphones, rather being something that just does what is needed, have become an constant irritant.

Horrible, intermittent bluetooth connection issues (possible faulty pair)


These are the second pair I've purchased. The first pair worked great and I had nothing but good things to say. Then I lost them and I ordered a second pair because I loved the first ones so much.This new pair has horrible bluetooth connection problems. Every time I turn them on, they connect automatically to my phone as they are supposed to. The problem is that the first and sometimes second time they connect, the connection is dropped then picked up repeatedly. This annoying connection issue results in interrupted sound and the annoying ""beep beep"" every time it disconnects and then reconnects. The only way I can connect successfully is if I ""forget the device"" on my phone, turn off the headset, turn off my phone, then turn everything on and reconnect. It's really annoying. Additionally, the range is significantly worse on this pair. Before, I was able to leave my phone in the gym as I moved around and I had no range issues. Now, I can't even put my phone in my pocket without it fading in and out.I think there is something faulty with the newest pair because I never had these problems before with my first pair, which I gave a stellar review for.

Great product.


So far so good. These arrived in less than 24 hours. Fits the ear well and come with different sizes of ear buds. I usually have a hard time keeping earbuds in my ears but so far they have stayed in. They are lightweight. Great bass and sound. Easy to use with directions and warranty included. Clear sound when making and receiving calls. Controls and microphone are on right headset (photos included). Battery life pops up on iPhone when paired! I’ve already recommended this product to others!UPDATE 6/6/18:  the sound quality for music and talking on the phone is great when the earbud part is secure in the ear. I have issues keeping earbuds (not just these) secure in the ear and this pair slips out when sweaty. The ear hook part doesn’t really hold the earbud in place, which is frustrating. I will likely give these to my husband to use.

Great product, esp. for the price -- and excellent customer service


I had a pair of Apple Airpods, which are awesome in many ways, but they stopped working after 1.5 years and Apple wouldn't service, only replace for $69. So I figured I'd try this highly rated product at the other end of the price spectrum. I'm really impressed with these little earbuds. Very nice sound (nothing like my old corded Sures, but very respectable), decent noise cancellation, easy to pair and use, comfortable, and I like it that they're connected to each other. I use them mostly at the gym and they've been pretty perfect for that. I ran into a pairing issue and the company replaced them quickly and painlessly. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for good, comfortable, easy-to-use, but not audiophile-level earbuds.

Good buy


So far I'm liking these headphones. The quality of sound is great. My last pair didn't get loud enough for me (I like my music pretty loud when I'm working out) and these get extremely loud. I haven't gone beyond halfway on the volume for the headphones. I don't particularly like that the main button is on the side. This button pauses if pressed once, and is the power button if held down. I constantly push my headphones in to my ears, because headphones never stay in for me. The button is where I would normally adjust the headphones, so I'm getting used to avoiding that. With that being said, the part that wraps behind your ear is great on these headphones. They're very adjustable! The only other thing I would forewarn about these headphones is that for some reason, when running outside, they catch a lot of wind. So the sound of the wind is pretty loud and obnoxious. Luckily, the volume overpowers it so you can blast your music and ignore it. But I'm not sure why that happens. My last Bluetooth headphones didn't cause this much wind noise. It must be the shaping of these that causes it. This isn't a problem when working out inside, obviously. 😊All in all, I think these headphones are great quaity for the price! I do recommend these headphones, and I thought it was nice that it comes with a magnetic car vent mount for your phone, and the cool case for the headphones themselves.

Great headphones that perform better than ones at higher price points!


These are really great headphones. The sound quality on these rates up there with over the ear headphones and goes way beyond what I'm used to for earbuds. The microphone works okay. I called a couple of people I know specifically to ask them how well it worked. They said it's a bit on the quiet side and needed to turn up there volume. However, the sound quality was clear. I'm still not clear how they do this with no microphone hanging off of it.The noise cancelling seems to work pretty good. I was able to transition from a quiet shop (no equipment running) to a noisy shop (46"" wood lathe and Craftsman shop vac running) and only had to turn up the volume ""two clicks"".The comfort of these are top notch. Every earbud I've worn in the past after about two hours I'm shifting them around because my ear canal is starting to hurt. I wore these in the shop last night for about three hours with no discomfort. It's also great having the controls on the headphone. When my wife comes into the shop I no longer need to pull the phone out of my pocket and fumble with the controls so I can hear what she is saying; I just click the side button and the music is paused.I'll be honest; when I first ordered these I was concerned about the quality based on the cost (you typically get what you pay for), but these buds punch way above their weight class. I have already recommended these to two of my coworkers and one of them just purchased a set. If you need a set of earbuds, get these; you won't be disappointed!

Great in every way except sound quality.


The headphones themselves seem of nice enough quality and come with a nice assortment of accessories. They are also comfortable. The problem though lies with heaphones primary job - playing great sounding music.  Yes, they'll play music but they are far from great sounding.  The main problem lies in the bass - boomy AND muddy or non-existant. The mids and highs are just ok. I tried each of the 4 setts of ear pieces and while there was a marked difference among them all none sounded as good as my cheaper (and discontinued) bluetooth headset that sadly died after a couple years of use.I'll probably order another brand and send back whichever of the two sounds worse. I suspect it will be this set as the bass issue is nearly unacceptable. I'm listening to pop/rock. I can't imagine how bad they'd sound with really bass heavy music.

Great Wireless Earphones!


It's critical to play around with the different sizes of the changeable ear cushions to get the right fit. Once you do, you will love these earphones. They give good sound and stay in place no matter how much you move around. I wear them for phone calls, conference calls, and listening to music/books/tv and they work beautifully. I've never had a problem with the mic during calls. When I have them both in my ears the noise cancellation is good. I like the fact that the phones are wired together, so if I only have one in my ear I can hook the other on my shirt or let it hang--so I don't have to worry about it getting lost. I would recommend these for someone listening while on the move.

Five Stars


ugh... have to change my review... they were great for about 9 months, then right just stopped working. It was never dropped, no water got in it, nothing - no damage except for the right earbud just stopped working after going in and out for a week...Re-ordered a second one... for the discounted price of $29.99 and boy are these not the same... why say they are discounted when the product is just a cheaper version, and I'm praying they last longer, but not feeling great about being duped. I don't feel like returning because they still work, hopefully longer than 9 months... say a few years?? The new ones do not have smooth, flexible silicone hooks like the original (they are just plastic), battery life is not 8 hours like the previous ones (more like 4 to 5 hours) and they do not charge as fast as the previous ones. the wireless cord is also stiffer... sound quality noticeably different - first ones had amazing sound quality.I don't hate them, but for $29 bucks... they feel cheap, especially compared to the short-lived first ones.

Spotty Bluetooth Connection / Left Ear Sound Dropped In and Out


I recently had a set of bluetooth headphones very similar to these that worked great for a little over a year before the left ear stopped working.  To replace those I purchased these the other day and was extremely disappointed.1) Bluetooth connection was spotty.  I've had some trouble with the bluetooth signals in the past when in a gym with a lot of people that are using bluetooth devices or running on a jogging trail next to a busy street but the first time I used these headphones I was working in the yard with nobody else around and the bluetooth signal continued to drop in and out.2) Left ear would periodically lose sound.  After about 45 minutes of use I noticed that the sound in the left headphone would drop off and then return once I jiggled the wire slightly.  It did this 5 or 6 times over the span of 10-15 minutes before I finally gave up and shut the headphones off.Needless to say I was very disappointed.  I initially was pretty optimistic about these headphones because they seemed fairly rugged and came packaged nicely with a good set of accessories to go along with them but they did not function well when used.

10/10 would buy again and recommend to friends.


I was in the market for some wireless headphones and these were on sale for under $40. I was skeptical but I figured I'd give it a shot. The product arrived promptly and to my surprise, they were very neatly packaged to ensure safety during shipping and they came with an array of accessories, such as multiple charging cords and such. They synced with my phone (Droid Turbo 2) flawlessly and sound great. They are NOT professional audiophile quality headphones, so while the sound is clear and pleasant, there wont be throbbing base. However, for workouts, bopping around the house, etc... they are great. The quality of workmanship is very nice  also, they do not feel cheap, nor do any of the accessories or case.Finally, the most important thing, is that they came with a little card in the box that said these have a 1 year warranty and that they hope I enjoy my product. I thought this was a nice addition. Today I received an email from one of the owners of the company, saying the same, and that if there were any issues, email him and he would make it right. That is a stellar level of customer service if you ask me.10/10 would buy again and recommend to friends.

Great earbuds, with one caveat


UPDATE:  Switching from 3 stars to 5.  See comment from SENSO customer support.I really like these earbuds.  I've always had trouble getting buds that fit and these fit the bill perfectly.  The sound is great (I'm not an audiophile).  It performs pretty much exactly as the product description says, although 8 hours of play time might be a stretch.  I haven't timed it, but I don't think I get 8 hours of playback.So, why only 3 starts you ask?  Well, 8 months later, I'm hearing some very mild ""skipping"" during playback.  The bluetooth connection seems to be a little off, so every 10 to 20 seconds I get a pause and restart as the connection to my iPhone 7.  The pause is extremely quick.  If I was just listening to music, I might not even notice it.  But, I use these earbuds when I'm working (software development) for background noise to help me concentrate on my work.  But, with these bluetooth hiccups, I end up focusing more on the quick pauses than my work.  I know the problem is with the earbuds because if I switch to my bluetooth speaker and play my music out loud, there are no such pauses.Now, don't let this review scare you off.  It's very possible that this issue is limited to my pair.  These are still the best earbuds I've ever owned.  They're not super expensive, so 8 months of problem free use is fair.  I just can't give 4 or more stars to a product that didn't maintain its initial quality for at least a year.

Great quality product at a very competitive price


I received your product along with 3 of your competitors and tried them all and found that your product was a clear winner in sound quality and comfort for my application.Battery life was also a factor.......I needed an ear bud that would be great in a wind situation that would allow me to hear and not lose them while in movement.The assortment of buds for the ear was crucial in this working and you folks have shown me that quality is not always dictated by price.Other more pricey products were returned and you folks came out the clear winner.Keep doing what you are doing and the consumers will recommend you as I will to others.I will be a return customer as well!Regards William Bell

My experience so far


Ok so my job allows us  to listen to music on the weekends but I also have to use my hands so I've been looking for and reading reviews on wireless headsets with good sound quality but the issue is my ears are pretty small so I knew going into it the thought of just wasting my money just to fall out of my ear when I looked at this one and read the  reviews all the reviews on here was great  so I decides to trust and try  it . when I received them I was extremely happy the earpiece itself is flexable so even with my small ears I can move it around to adjust to my needs.  I am also happy with ordering through Amazon because when it was delivered it was raining so I was afraid when I got home that it would have been destroyed but Amazon itself put it in a nice plastic bag to keep it safe. This particular purchase came with a nice case charging cable to charge it and I also like the additional information that I gave that you can't use a cheap charger otherwise it'll somehow destroy the earbuds so that's a nice little tidbit of information that was useful to me. This particular purchase also came with a card holder that I can put on the back of my phone and also a phone holder a magnetic one that I could hook to my car which is pretty nice I got rid of my big bulky one  and just clicked it on to my vent and put the little magnet on back of my phone and Bam there you go. back to the earphones  itself. it was really nice to be able to work hands-free take a phone call listen to my music and  call with just a single touch even though I still have to learn the buttons on where they are as I hung up on the person I was talking to a couple times but other than that I was extremely happy with this purchase and I will purchase again. The customer service has been great letting me know that there is a warranty and that if I need anything to let them know through single email and they'll be in contact within 24 hours I hope to never have to use them but it's nice to know that they're there if I need them.

Terrible Quality Downgrade from Past Products


I’ve ordered this product twice. I ordered the first set two years ago. They lasted two years, and I have nothing bad to say about them. They had great sound and microphone, great battery, and fit well around the ears. I recently ordered a second set since the original set topped working, and the quality is terrible. The microphone is not effective, the ear pieces feel cheap (the original set were a nice gauge rubber that felt substantial), and the plastic used feels very cheap. Overall, a tremendous downgrade from past products and incredibly disappointing.

I'm enjoying them


I have only used these three times so far but I am very pleased. I love the wireless feature. This is my first pair of wireless headsets and I was constantly snagging the wire on the traditional iPhone earbuds. So not having the dangling wire helps me feel free to walk around without fear one is about to get tugged from my ear.I'm happy with the sound quality. I've listened to music and an audio book and both have sounded great. I've never owned a pair of expensive earphones. So I'm not comparing then to anything more than my iPhone buds. But for my purpose as a stay at home mom who likes music once in awhile these sound great to me.I also was listening to an audiobook the other day when my husband called. I pushed the button on the side to answer the phone. My husband said he could hear me perfectly. It was easy and worked better than I expected since I've only ever answered my actual phone. So it was a cool feature.I did need to change out to the smallest ear tip that they came with. I'm still learning to really get them in my ear but once I do they feel very secure.

3 month life span


These were great and I used them in the gym, out on runs or sometimes while cleaning the house but one day while listening 3 months after I got them they just stopped playing. They will connect and at the end of saying my headset is connected it just cuts off and there is no sound. So for 3 months they were great and then they all of a sudden just won’t work. I mean I know they aren’t expensive and you expect them to work for a long time but I expected them to work longer than 3 months

Random chances of good or bad?


OK, I bought two of this. The first one was two years ago. Until now that one still works find. I used it literally for every activities, particular gym and exercising. It worked so well that I decided to buy a 2nd one even though the 1st was still working. This is because I don't want to wait for charging (having two to rotate).The 2nd one was bough two months ago. Within one month (under the same usage conditions), its connectivity deteriorated. Its reception is terrible within my house, particular at the spots where the first one still has perfect reception. Its audio completely lost the bass (low frequencies). Not only that, the remaining high pitch sound regularly get distorted (kind of like when you play a cassette tape in fast forward mode). I don't like chances. The first one gets 5 stars. The second one get 1 star. Average 3 stars.

Dismissed Bluetooth? Me too! My advice is DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE!


I am an experienced OEM which means that I am certified by Microsoft as an ""Original Equipment Manufacturer"" which means I build custom gaming systems. But I am an individual who has prejudice against, at the time, unproven technology. However I was diagnosed with a disease that doesn't allow me to pursue my career and I spend almost all my time listening to audio books, my sight is also affected badly. I tired quickly of spending a fortune on expensive earbuds and I purchased ""wireless' aka Bluetooth earbuds. I couldn't have been more thrilled. The sound is comparable to more expensive earbuds but I have found that the quality of the materials used to produce them were infiery by far. I love the moisture resistant feature the extras like the care charger and the new Apple compatible charger and adaptive cord. I would love to purchase a cordless charger for the home use. Can anyone recommend a quality product worthy of the price and compatible with the Alcatel Fierce XL. Please contact me using the info in my profile. Thanks again. Debbie

Great Product and Customer Service!


Got my SENSO headphones late last year.  I was really impressed by the gorgeous design and superb stereo sound, plus it fits comfortably on your ears.  I literally use it everyday--when I watch a movie, listen to music, audiobook or podcast.Recently, I had a setback when one of the earbuds stopped functioning.  Then I remembered that this product has a 1-year warranty.I contacted the seller thru the Amazon website.  I did not expect much, but, to my surprise, Tekatron responded promptly and courteously.Tekatron gave me this assurance: ""Our products go through a strict quality check but there may be rare cases when a product turns out to be faulty.""Tekatron has promised to send me a replacement soon.

Very comfortable, good fidelity and long lasting batteries.


I've had these over a year an I am very happy with them.  These replaced my second set of Motorola S10D.  These are very llght weight, more comfortable, have very good fidelity and the batteries last much longer.  I get at least 2 to 3 2 hour sessions in the gym with them- even now after more than a year of use.  The earpieces are very soft and fit very comfortably, and block out outside noise very well.  I like the controls in the earpiece to pause, play, track forward and back, and volume.  The phone reception also works well.My only complaint is the logic of the track forward and back buttons which are also the volume up and down buttons.  The forward facing button controls volume down and track back, and the back facing button controls volume up and track forward.  Intuitively what they control should be reversed; ie forward button to go track forward and volume up and back button to go track back and volume down.

Amazing headphones and accessories


These headphones are amazing! I have only worn them 3 times but I'm so pleased with how they fit, how lightweight they are and the quality of the sound.  I like that they don't sound or feel like I'm wearing earplugs.  They don't totally block out everything around me so I can still hear a car approaching and the ocean waves as I run down the beach but I also hear my music.  Of course I don't have them cranked up all the way either.  The controls work very well and are easy to use while I'm running.  I had an incoming call while I was wearing them today and I could hear the caller perfectly.  It was even windy on the boardwalk and I didn't notice it nor was the caller able to hear anything on their end.  I can't speak for how long the batteries hold but yet.  The case and accessories that come with the headphones are top notch as well. I just couldn't be happier that I purchased these at such a great price!

Lasted 6m.


I used these both at work and at the gym.The sound quality was perfectly acceptable for what they are. The connectivity range was fine. The earbuds were perfectly comfortable for me.Of course, there were bluetooth issues that often annoyed me. I'd find myself at the gym turning on and off the bluetooth on the phone and turning on and off the headphones annoyingly often; sometimes I just had to completely ""forget"" the device to finally get them to pair. I have the latest version Android on a Nexus 6P but this is just a problem with bluetooth no matter what I'm pairing to, it seems.The general design of wired bluetooth headphones like these is, in my opinion, really annoying for a space where there are other people who might want to talk get my attention; you can have both ears in or both ears out, but if you take out just one it'll be pulling at the other one and it's really annoying.As for things I think this product could have done better...As if I hadn't spent $50 on a pair of headphones I keep in their own case, one of the ears has started losing its connection. I can still get sound out of it if I hold my head just so, but in practice, it's done for, and that happened about 6m after I started using them.Running, at least for me, meant an awful musical experience with these. The weight of each ear means they bounce while running -- not much, but enough that the careful fit / seal required to get reasonable sound quality couldn't be maintained; the sound would just sort of bounce in and out as I ran. Fine for podcasts, but if you care about how music sounds AT ALL (or just get easily annoyed) while running, these might not be for you. I could see this being less of a risk for people with larger ears, though.There's also very little in the way of discerning battery state. I just assumed mine always needed charging unless they were just charged.

Hooks are fixed, not adjustable, so they do not stay on your ear


I returned these because they did not fit my ears. The ear “hook” was just that, a hook! They were silicone & soft, but not flexible! They would not wrap securely around my ear, and as a result, they fell out. Don’t buy these if you plan to use them for running. I contacted the seller and was told maybe a pair slipped by quality assurance. So I bought 3 different models from this company, and yes….they all “slipped” off my ears. I returned them all.

Good headphones for the price (UPDATE)


Update: (from 4 to 2 stars)After a couple of years since the date of purchase, the rubber on the wires that connect the earphone to the other, started peeling off until it was totally gone. What's left now are the thin wires that once were covered by the rubber. I tried taping it it all around the wires, but it wasn't pleasing to the eye so I disposed of it. It was expected and it did serve its purpose considering the price.Great quality sound for the price. My only complaint about the product is that the silicone piece that wraps around the ear is too high and I don't see a way to adjust it. Although it is flexible, in terms of width, the height is way too high for my small ears. Good thing though the ear plugs do stick to the ears even with movements. Overall, decent headphones with good quality audio and design.

Great deal with a serious flaw


These are just good headphones for under $40. I can run or bike with them and the sound quality is quite good. They feel sturdy and although i haven't tested this yet, claim to be weatherproof. i like the controls and it also uses a standard charger that I have in abundance from various other electronics. One of my biking buddies bought these to replace his pricey Beats and he likes them just as much.The frustration with these though is the controls. The headphones are constantly making beeping sounds that I have no idea how to stop. It seems to switch to other functions randomly, and I have a lot of frustration getting it to do what it should do, which is play music.  So I spend a lot of time angrily pressing the button trying to get it to stop beeping when I just want to run and listen to some tunes.

Great earbuds and great service


I've had this set of earbuds for about 10 months now and use them mainly for listening to audio books, music and for phone calls.  I own two sets of Senso earbuds (S-250 and S-300) and am very happy with both.  They have very good battery life and charge quickly.  They come with various size fittings for ears including a foam set that works really nice as well as a nice zip up carrying case.  In addition, they have a one year warranty.  When one of my sets began to fail, I contacted customer support through their website (during the weekend) and provided my Amazon order ID.  They verified my warranty and processed a replacement shipment immediately.  It's been a great experience overall.  I would definitely recommend these earbuds and the company in general.

WORTH IT.


I was expecting these to be just okay, but I can't get enough of them - I opt to use them whenever possible instead of using my traditional headphones! Sound is GREAT (some reviewers noted a little boost in bass but I didn't experience that - I listen to Pandora and the Music app on my iPhone 6S and I've never had an issue, If you have an issue with bass it's incredibly easy to adjust, as another reviewer pointed out.DEFINITELY make sure you try different sizes of the earbud covers that come with the headphones - they have memory foam ones on already, but one of my ears didn't hold that in well, so I switch to the mushroom-cap-shaped ones and they're perfect and very comfortable. Pairing and button use are straightforward and easy.Only downside is that the cord clips come off a little too easily so my cord doesn't stay clamped together to shorten it very well but that's a non-issue for me.

Not perfect for smaller ears, but solid product with excellent customer service


Headphones working wihout issue and with great sound after 1 month, though as a small woman they do not fit snugly, even in the smallest size of the three covers that come with the set (this has made me consider ear size relative to height as a valid issue for the first time :P). They haven't actually fallen out while running, but it feels like they will, which can be a little distracting, and since they are not snug it does have a mild negative impact on sound quality. I might have only given 3 stars for this reason, except that I had an excellent experience with customer service, because when I received my package it had been tampered with and the actual headphones stolen (presumably by someone at Amazon because the Amazon tape was intact, but the inner package had been broken into). I called Senso customer service and they gave me no hassle whatsoever in sending me a replacement set right away.

Good for the price, must realize that you are getting what you pay for.


These are 2 star headphones, but a 3-4 star buy for the $30 price tag.  I have taken these on atleast 12 runs and use pretty regularly working around the house or garage.  The sound quality overall is pretty good.  Here are the basic pros and cons experienced.Pros:- Price Point (obviously)- Comfortable- Sound Quality is GoodCons:- Have had issues with the Bluetooth connectivity.  I have had to ‘forget device’ and reestablish the link multiple times on my phone (iPhone 6S Plus)- Bass is slightly too deep in my opinion.- The minimum allowable volume does not go low (quiet) enough.  I run with a group and would like to be able to turn the volume down just one more notch, but can’t.  I would like to hear it, but still be able to hear conversations around me.  I know this is probably a rare issue with most.- Expereince distortion on and off during every use.  It is not a huge deal, but it is like listening to a CD (for those how remember those) with some light scratches...sound just gets ‘choppy’ here and there.- The ‘last number redial’ feature is HORRIBLE and i wish it didn’t exist.  It is cold here in Oklahoma, so have been wearing gloves during my runs and have inadvertently called people more than I can count while trying to pause the sound (because the volume doesn’t get low enough as mentioned).  Luckily my wife has received most of these calls, but I have called work related people, which is embarrassing.  The feature is worthless in my opinion.Ultimately, I am OK with my purchase and will continue to use these for the time being.  The price is right and overall most of the drawbacks are minor.

They work but have issues.


I have had these headphones now for 10 months and they worked pretty good. The sounds quality on music is good with good bass, they are pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods. The problems I have had are:1) Picks up a lot of outside noise while walking making it hard for people you are talking to to hear you.2) Within the last week the sound is suddenly cutting out even though they are still connected to my device, I have to shut them off and back on to get them to work.3) Sometimes the volume up and down buttons don't respond right away and then they work good.I am still under warranty so I contacted Senso support and I'm working with them to fix the issue with sound cutting out. I will update once I have this figured out.

Perfect Shape and Sound


After reading a number of positive reviews for these headphones I made the switch.  It was one of the best purchases i have made recently.  I have a hard time with earbuds, specifically in one ear.  They always fall out.  Along the same lines I never was a fan of headphones that hooked over the ear because after a lengthy wear my outer ear will get sore. These are the best of both worlds.  Soft outer support and a perfect inner ear shape that stays in through even the toughest workouts.Like a lot of the other reviews here the sound is amazing.  I actually have never turned the volume all the way up as i am sure it would do some damage.  Good bass and great overall sound.  It is funny that I am noticing that some of my favorite songs are sounding different because of the high quality of these headphones.  For the price, you cannot beat it. Don't think just buy.

So far so good!  Ordered these about a month ago and decided to give them a try given that I was tired of paying upwards of $150 for bluetooth wireless headphones to use during workouts that continued to fail (yes you JLAB and BEATS) and have the worst customer service and figured why not try SENSO.Only 4 stars at this point, as I am waiting a few more months to see how they hold up as I have read several reviews that indicate the durability isn't there and they have had them fail.....as of 1 month in with daily usage consisting of weight-lifting, running and competitive basketball training...these headphones ROCK!!!!Good sound, they stay very secure in my ears through all aspects of training and the battery life is very impressive.Some have complained about the soft year supports that wrap the ear - I love them...they are comfortable and do block ambient noise well...although not fully which is fine for a set of headphones being used outside.Will check back in within a few months and update the review!

Water Proof!


Great headphones, I am pleased that they sent along spare, and different size replacement ear buds.I purchased these headphones to see if I could use them in and near water.  I tried them in the shower to test them out.I am  Very happy to say that the sound quality was excellant.  The volumn control worked well.  Although they got wet, inside and out of my ear, they continued to work and stayed on/in my ears very well.  I read that ""direct spray"" might be a problem, so i kept them out of direct spray as much as possible.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with the Senso Bluetooth WATERPROFF headphones.  Buy them, You will love them too.

Highly Reccomend


Back in February, I purchased a pair of these earbuds having only tried Apple earbuds or really high-quality earbud brands like Bose. This pair is the only pair I have found that I can say is on the same level as Bose and I can't recommend these enough. The sound quality is exceptional, especially for the price, the battery life is insane, and the only grievances I have with these earbuds is that they don't work that well over calls, which is a common problem among all Bluetooth earbuds, and that after 6 months of using them, the power/play&pause button got pushed in a little too far and wasn't working. I contacted SENSO and they were very understanding, and exchanged my broken pair for a new one after verifying that the warranty was still in place and that there was a clear problem with mine. If you are on the fence about these earbuds, please buy them. They are easily my favorite pair of earbuds and I always leave the house with my pair. Highly recommend!

TERRIBLE PRODUCT AND WORSE SUPPORT!


terrible product and horrible support. I contacted them on dec 25th to tell them that the replacement set they sent me no longer holds a charge. They emailed me back with instructions on how to reset them. I tried to reset but because it doesn't hold a charge, the reset does not work. I emailed them back 45 minutes later indicating it would not reset. 5 days go by and I still haven't heard from them. I email them again. several days go by, I email them again. several more days go by (today) I email them again. Finally, I look up their number and call them. I'm told that my warranty expired Dec 29th and that because it's Jan 6th, I'm out of warranty. I explained to them that I contacted them 5 days before the warranty expired and indicated the product was no longer working. The reply, ""It doesn't matter. You're now contacting me today and the warranty expired on the 29th""

long lasting battery & great sound


I love the fact that the battery life is so long. I charged it 3 days ago and i'm still using them. They're not constantly running, but every time I'm outside doing yard work I need my hands and use these. They are great with noise cancellation on my end, but anytime i'm on the phone with them on everyone hears everything in my background. You have to have both pieces in your ears because one side will end up pulling on the other if you just have it hanging around your neck. For the price you pay these are great. Quality is great.

Great product and unbeatable for the price. I would buy these again!


So far these are fantastic headphones! I've been using them for over a week at the gym and generally around the house, and they have performed . extremely well. They ear hooks keep them in place, and work really well with the actual replacement buds. The battery life seems terrific and I haven't had to charge them because of the battery dying. They sync really fast to your device, and so far they work with my iPhone 7 just fine.As for the sound, it's spot on for workout headphones. It doesn't produce much bass, but I usually listen to podcasts and the speaking voices come through very clear. The lack of bass is a little disappointing, but it's not enough to look past these headphones. I've also had a few calls with these, and the other line doesn't seem to have any troubles hearing me.Overall, these are absolutely fantastic headphones and they definitely deserve the 5 star rating! You can't bear the price and the extra accessories you get with it! I would recommend these to anybody looking for bluetooth headphones and especially for working out.

Right Pocket, Left Pocket.  Pencil in my eye socket!


These easily stayed on my ears for all 10 miles of my run. They are light weight and the sound quality is plenty good enough.  I could still hear wind noise on a windless day (wind was from my slow running pace!), but that is OK.  I will warn people that these cannot be worn if your cell phone is in your left shorts pocket.  The bluetooth constantly dropped the signal which was so annoying I wanted to stab a pencil in my eye.  After 5 miles of fuming and plotting how I would return them and write a scathing review, it occurred to me that the bluetooth receiver is probably on my right ear and the signal has to travel through 3 feet of body tissue from my left pocket.  Sure enough, when I switched the phone to my right pocket everything worked great.  My eyes are forever grateful.

Good headphones but broke eventually


I bought these Bluetooth headphones 1.5 years ago. They did pretty well . But eventually the left headphone stopped working.Pros:- reasonable price.- light weight- holds the charge- charge fast- stays on during workout- customer service were nice, cooperative and tried to help. but due to limitation in the warranty I did not get a replacement.cons:- sometimes they don't connect to the phone right away.- the left piece stopped working- it was uncomfortable at the beginning (it takes time to get used to it)- many other brand have the same features and slightly cheaper so nothing special about senso plus a longer warranty period.

Not too Bad....


They are fantastic for sound and quality, but for the life of me I can not keep them in my ears.  Why?  I have tried ever one of the ear bud sizes.  Nothing works.  Every single time I turn my head they pull on the cord and the buds slip out of my ear.  Plus if you have long hair they are super difficult to put the ear pieces around your ear because they get caught up with your hair.  I don't always like to have my hair in a ponytail just to wear these headphones.  So I am happy with their sound and battery life, but keeping them in my ears is a problem...

Low Price but High Quality!


Just got these the other day to replace a broken pair of Jaybird headphones.  I was obviously skeptical due to the price being so low but after seeing all the reviews I figured they were worth a shot.  Wore them for the first time today and love them!!  I can't believe how well they work and fit for such a low price.  No issues connecting at all and I LOVE the ear pieces that came with them.  I have tried Beats headphones and I can't ever get them to fit right in my ears.  I was worried as these look the same - but the ear pieces worked amazingly well.  Tight fit and that helps block out the outside noise too.  I wear these during crossfit so lots of running, jumping, etc.  They stayed in great and there were no issues with sound.  Don't be afraid of the price - these are a terrific buy.

Great Quality Bluetooth Headphones


So impressed with the quality of these headphones is a 4 1/2 Star. Sound is very clear, easy to set with the Bluetooth. When I first charged it went fairly quickly. Just keep in mind not to over charge to keep the battery life span. Walked around the house and was still able to hear clearly. Comes with extra accessories, nice small portable case. Charger is smaller than expected but that makes it easier to place inside your case along with your headphones. Headphones are pretty comfy to place in your ear and came with several extra rubber buds to fit your size. I would definitely recommend this product.When a call came through it told you the complete phone number that was calling. But when I answered it didn’t connect on the headphones but I’m thinking perhaps I missed something on the instructions.

Amazing Bluetooth headphones and even more amazing Customer Service


I don't write reviews often so it really takes a product that impresses me enough to feel like writing a review about it. This is one of those items.These headphones while maybe not the top of the line sound quality (but they do sound superb for what they are) are the best deal I have found for Bluetooth headphones.  They sound amazing for the price and the battery lasts longer than most BT headphones. I use them almost every day and for me, I will never switch away from them. They are exactly what I need in a pair of headphones.Pros:- They sounds amazing for the price paid.- They are comfortable and stay in the ears. I barely notice them when wearing them.- The battery life is one of the best I have found for BT headphones.- They are easy to use and NEVER have disconnected from my phone unless I turned them off or walked too far away.- The BT range is amazing. I don't lose connect anywhere in my apartment or even walking out to the car.- The case is made very well and the accessories included make the price even better.Cons:- For me, NONE. I love these things as they are more than I ever expected for the price.- Some say that the bass is not very good. I have listened to just about everything on these headphones and the only time I noticed not enough bass was during a few songs. Otherwise, they are nicely balanced sound wise.- The ear hoops are not adjustable. They work perfectly for me, but might not be as good for small ears.  Try them, you can always return them, but they are worth a try.Company:One of the main reasons why I am writing this review is not because of the actual headphones themselves, but the company that makes them, SENSO.  I bought my headphones about 6 months ago and I have used them VERY often ever since. A few weeks ago, the outer panel of the headphones started falling off.  After putting the plate back on lots of times, I finally contacted SENSO with a request for assistance.  I got a reply instantly from an amazing person who worked with me to resolve the problem. I cannot stress this enough. Their first reply was literally a few minutes after I sent the request (it was there when I next picked up my phone). Through a few emails I was able to explain the issue and give them some pictures and explanations for the QC department.  Then I got an email stating that they 100% support their products and want to ensure that ""each customer gets the highest level of quality products"". Another pair was shipped out that day and arrived within a couple days. I just want to stress the amazing results from this conversation and the true extent that they care for their customers... The whole email process from request to an email stating they were sending the replacements only took 10 HOURS. I have never in my life seen customer service move that fast.  Every email was professional, kind, and to the point.  These people are amazing and will help you if you have issues with a product you bought from them.  I cannot thank them enough and will be a customer of theirs forever.  They have earned my business and I will gladly keep purchasing their products and recommending them to everyone I can.Thank you SENSO for an amazing product and an truly amazing customer service department. You should be proud and you have made a very happy customer. Thank you so much and keep up the good work.

Fat head? No problem!


Let's point out the elephant in the room and acknowledge that not all humans are the skinny and/or athletic build type. Those solid, behind the head wireless headphones can't reach both ears without ripping one off.  As for the collars that sit around your neck? I dont need to look like I work at a call center, thank you.These headphones are the bomb!  The two buds are on a long coated wire that can easily reach around the big jellyroll on the back of my head.  Or if I keep the connector in front, it doesn't irritate any of my chins.  I highly recommend these headphones to anyone of a ""big-ish"" size.

Audio Quality is Fantastic! But there are gaps during audio playback that ruin the experience! Please Read the UPDATE!


I love the sound of the headphones, but for some reason with my iPhone 6S Plus & iPad 9.7 Pro there appears to be static or connection problems when I'm talking on the phone or when listening to audio. There are multiple pauses or gaps in audio and I do not understand why. When the sound plays, I love the audio quality but the multiple gaps in audio ruin the audio experience. Is there anything I can do to fix the problem?UPDATE:I love my SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. I posted earlier that the audio quality was fantastic but I experienced multiple gaps and static during playback. Well, I noticed that I experienced these gaps during audio playback each time the headphones were connected to two devices at the same time. When there is only one connection, the headphones play beautifully with no problems in connection at all. The headphones fit nicely and they have a gorgeous design. I love them, but I wish there was no static and connection problems when they are connected to multiple devices. If that's a feature of the headphones, then it should work.

Good for the money


I ordered these headphone because they received good reviews on line and I needed another set of bluetooth headphones for the gym and the car.  They cam already charged and were very easy to set up with my devices.  They are comfortable and feel secure as they have a plastic extension that wraps around the ear to keep it stable.If you are looking for BOSE sound quality, you will be disappointed.  To be honest, not many sound as good.  if the BOSE sound was a 10 then these are about a 7.  Don't get me wrong they sound good and they are comfortable and for the money they are a good value.I have only had them a week so the long term review will come later.

Better than my previous!


This is my second pair of bluetooth headphones. I wish I could remember what my first pair was, but I bought them on Groupon after reading on a blog that they were ""the best"" running headphones. They were $70, the sound was okay, and the buds fell out of my ear always. Luckily they have been stolen abroad and this time around I was more hesitant to shell out more than $50 for a pair of headphones.These are 100x better than my old ones. They stay in my ear the entire time I run on the treadmill. The sound is amazing in my opinion. It's clear and loud and if you like music with bass, the bass is strong with these headphones.The only things I DON'T like is that the buttons to switch to the next track is in an awkward position(on top one of the buds). I wish it had buttons on the side of the cable.

The quality is way higher than what the price would make you think!


These are great headphones for the $- they are inexpensive and I primarily bought them so I could listen to Audible books while working out so I thought “How good does that sound really have to be to listen to someone talking”- turns out they are fabulous for listening to music as well- Just as good as my $90 ones that fall out of my ears every 1/4 mile when I’m running or if I move to tie my shoe or pick up a weight.  I also have sort of small ears and I love that the ear hooks are totally moldable to wrap securely around my ears I put the strap in the back and I don’t notice it all- for the price, you really can’t go wrong.

Great value for money


UPDATE: Thanks to a quick response from Cathy at Senso customer support, I tried changing the ear tip to use the large one and it has greatly reduced the wind noise as it gave me a better fit (though not eliminated 100% but I guess that's expected of any in-ear headphone. Updating the review to 4 stars and ordering another on for my wife :)This is my first and only ""noise canceling"" Bluetooth headset so I have nothing else to compare this with. But here is what I feel after using it for a couple of months:The good: The sound quality and the build quality is pretty good for the price. I am not an audiophile so didn't wanna spend big bucks on a headset and this one just serves the purpose.The bad: you can't wear it for a long duration without getting the feeling to take it out. Also the cable length is kinda small for me and I keep having to adjust it.The ugly: forget about using it outdoors while you are running/cycling or even walking in a windy area. It amplifies the wind noise instead of canceling it. Almost entirely useless as a ""sports"" headset. It does work perfectly in the gym though.Recommendation: if you are looking for a headset you could use on your outdoor runs, this is not the one for you. Otherwise it's a great value for money

Random connection with iPhone


The problem I have with this earbud is the connection with a smartphone (iPhone 5s in my case). Seems the Bluetooth connection gets established between the earbud and the iPhone, but when I try to play a podcast the sound quite often comes out of the phone itself and not from the earbud. I have to reconnect the earbud with the phone a few times and eventually I get my podcasts played from the earbud. This is annoying as it is unpredictable. Seldom I get the earbud connected from the beginning, but most often I have to turn the earbud off/on multiple times. I can't figure out the rules of the game. Once the connection is established I see no more problem. The earbud can play for hours (4-5 hours at least) on a charge. But the connection problem drives me crazy and I think twice before using the earbud every time as I know I will have to wrestle with it.UpdateFollowing the advice from the customer support (reset the earbuds and reconnect to iPhone) totally fixed the issue described above. Now the earbuds are functioning exceptionally well, and I am very satisfied now. Five stars (for their customer support too)!

Powerful, cheap option


I bought these for my dedicated running headphones, and they work well for that purpose.  Even to my uncritical ear, the sound range is a bit empty but they are powerful.  The lowest volume setting can be too loud under some circumstances.  They fit fairly well for my slightly small ears, feel lighter than they are, and stay put under moderate exercise.  Pairing etc. was no trouble with my Galaxy S10.Update:  Six months later headphones will inexplicably not turn on.  They show a blue charged light and beep in response to ""on"" button press when plugged in but do not make any noise/connect when not plugged in.  Happened day after run in the rain so water might have been an issue.  Honestly, par for the course for me.

Incredible headphones, awesome company!


I ordered the wrap around headphones originally, and when they arrived, they were exactly as advertised. I however have smaller ears, and the wrap around rubber part did not secure them well for me. I emailed them about the issue, looking to get a different pair.I believe about 30 minutes later I had an email apologizing for the inconvenience, and asking how they could help. They offered to send me new headphones for free, which I believe are the S300 instead of the S200.I had the new headphones in about 3 days, and they are incredible. I workout about 5 times a week and use them every time, as well as when around the house, mowing the lawn, etc.These are awesome headphones for the money, and frankly, I bought into the whole Beats fad when I was younger, and was less than impressed. I however am very very impressed with these.Thank you!

Buyer's remorse


I had high hopes for these, based on many of the reviews, but the reality has gone down since I began using the headphones. These started out great, and the sound is definitely a pro of the product. My main issues, of why I wouldn't go higher than 2 stars, is that the battery life isn't as advertised and the fit is pretty poor. The flexible ear hooks would be nice, if they weren't so darn large! I've tried all three of the ear buds, thinking a change may help, but the ear hooks are definitely not comfortable and I'm constantly having to fix them so the headphones don't fall out/off. Not the best design for everyone, although I'm sure others find this appealing.I would certainly return them, if I had the chance, but at this point I'm stuck. Certainly buyer's remorse...

This is my 3rd set


This is my 3rd set of Senso Bluetooth headphones. The first set lasted a year until I accidentally ripped off one of the ear pieces. It was an earlier version with the non-adjustable ear hooks which I liked. The mic feature never worked for that set and neither did the music control other than play/pause. I also noticed occasional skipping when my phone was in my pocket. Otherwise I was very happy with the product.The second set I got was more or less the same. I actually DO NOT LIKE the adjustable ear hooks. I take them in and out regularly when talking to people directly and then find I have to take time to readjust them in my ear constantly as the hook doesn't seem to hold its shape very well.I got the new model ones to see if they fixed the ear hook annoyance. It does seem a little better though it might be because they are brand new. It does seem they have fixed the skipping issue. So for the price they are great, just wish the ear hooks were even stiffer to stay as you form them better. I loved the original hooks but I understand that they wouldn't be a good fit for everyone.

Comfortable, good isolation, and good sound isolation, but controls are a little awkward


These headphones have been great so far.  They fit comfortably over the earlobes, and the wide range of tip sizes means I was able to find a pair that fits snugly in my ears, which both keeps them from bouncing around and provides good isolation from outside noise.  The sound quality seems pretty good to me, but I freely admit that I'm not much of an audiophile, and I'm using them while exercising anyhow, so I may not be as discerning as some listeners.  I was looking for a good pair of workout phones, and I feel like these perform admirably in that role, so I'm happy with that.There are a few negatives, however.  The first is that the volume buttons are tiny and a little hard to locate by touch, so adjusting the volume or skipping a track while wearing them can involve a fumbling.  Also, unlike every other set of headphones I've ever had, volume up/track forward is at the back of the assembly, and volume down/track backward is at the front.  I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but for now it's the opposite of what I'm used to, and it's a little annoying.  Finally, the cover for the charging port fits very snugly and completely flush with its surroundings, which is good, but the tab for getting hold of it to uncover the port is tiny.  Even after a couple weeks of practice it still takes me several tries to get it open.  A larger tab and/or a thicker cover (i.e., so that it doesn't sit exactly flush with the housing) would have made getting into the charging port a lot easier.

OK headphones but do not believe the ""sweat proof"" claim!


OK first the positives:-connect easily and reliably reconnect-decent range (not spectacular, but not bad)-decent sound quality-controls are easy to accessNow the negatives:-from the get-go I have been annoyed by wind noise... these headphones stick so far out of your ear that if you run or cycle you will get noticeable and annoying noise. In fact even when I walk briskly or if I'm out on a windy day this is a problem. Very annoying!-after using them for less than 5 months they gave out on my during my bicycle commute. I was sweating heavily so this wasn't the first pair of BT headphones that have suffered from my sweating... but this was the first pair I bought that made the bold claim to be ""sweat proof""Bottom line- DO NOT be fooled by this claim. If you are buying these BT headphones only for use in the office or at home you will probably be fine. But if you want to exercise outside be ready for wind noise and... if you sweat don't expect them to last more than a few months.

great price for good headphones


General first impressions: - these headphones are well constructed and sound good, but do not look very nice when worn. I have never cared much for the rectangular-block-in-the-ear look. In spite of that they are not too conspicuous, and overall this is a better experience that the old wired buds that I have had in the past.Setup - I never read instructions if I don't have to, and the only trouble I had getting these up and running was identifying the main button cleverly shaped into the logo. There rest should be familiar to someone who has previously used a Bluetooth device. I am very impressed with the connection on these. I, unknowingly, left my phone at my desk and walked away and I didn't hear any loss of sound until I got about 30 feet away.connecting two devices - I was able to connect both my phone and laptop at the same time but it was tricky (again, didn't read instructions). To do this I paired and connected the phone. then I disconnected it and paired it to the laptop, then I turned the headphones off and back on again, it connected itself to both devices. I did experience some loss of sound when trying to run sound on both devices at the same time so you do have to carefully manage each each device it will not play sound from each device simultaneously.Sound - I am no audiophile so take my opinion for what it is but I thing the sound is great.Mic - Used the mic for several calls. It was great while driving and I could be as loud as I wanted but had trouble picking me up in the office when I felt the need to be quieter. I do love the hands free driving.Comfort - This is why I docked a star. extended use leaves my outer ear feeling raw. I find that I need to alternate ears if I want to listen for longer than an hour. On another note I love not having a cord running to my phone that is constantly getting yanked and caught on things.misc - charge time 1-2 hours and use time was 10-12 hours. I thought this was great.Pros: great quality for low price, great Bluetooth connection, sounds goodcons: can get uncomfortable over time.Over all I think it is a great price for good headphones.

I'm a little disappointed with the base


The guys in the shower at the rehab center couldn't believe I was washing my hair  and taking a shower wearing the headphones. They couldn't figure out where the music was coming from. However, I'm a little disappointed with the base, I like a lot of base. I found out that if I hold, push in on  them in a little while in the ear I can here more of the base and sound much better. So I'm not sure what I can do to get them to fit tighter in the ear. I might try and maybe smaller ear piece, but I want them snugger in my ear so I can get that base. How do I get the headphones tight in my ear? Overall very nice product, couldn't believe all the extras, cords, case, adapters etc. Keep up the good work. Thank you SENSO guys. Rodney

Terrible w/ Apple Watch!!!


I purchased these to use with my Apple Watch when working out and I don’t know if I got a defective pair or what but they were terrible on so many levels. They’re awkward to put on, didn’t pair easily, and wouldn’t maintain a bluetooth connection longer than 2 seconds (and I really mean 2 seconds) unless I LITERALLY held my wrist up next to my ear... again, not sure if they were defective or if they just don’t have a bluetooth range greater than 6 inches but I ended up carrying them in my hand the rest of my run home because they were that bad. They were fully charged but not overcharged. And I so wanted to like these - extremely disappointed.

Bulky, but worked great for 6 months.


They stay in your ears almost no matter what, but they are bulky. The size creates that good bass sound. They draw attention they are so large. Unfortunately one pair I bought has already developed a circuit problem when switched ON. It creates a terrible noise then shuts off right away. Into the trash...

Great earbuds, except when it’s windy


Been using these on my runs for a couple of years now. I have odd-shaped ears that won’t hold in-ear buds, like Apple’s, so I really appreciate the over-the-ear hooks. Never had a problem with them connecting to or maintaining the connection to my phone. The button controls are conveniently located above the right ear. Battery life is good for about three runs before needing to recharge. My only complaint would be, when there is a headwind, there is so much wind noise that gets into my ears. I guess it’s just my weird ears, but the silicone tips don’t seat well enough to block out the wind.

Far superior to higher priced, bigger name earbuds


I bought these over two years ago and they have held up with no issues yet.  The sounds quality for me is fine.  If you're expecting audiophile SQ, these aren't for you but if you want to enjoy your music while on a run and still be cognizant of your surroundings these are great.  I am a heavy sweater when I exercise and have never had an issue with these crapping out due to moisture.  As a comparison in the past I had two pairs of Sport? Power? (can't recall exact name) Beats that broke from sweat/moisture.  The earbuds still charge quickly and hold a charge for a long time.  I had a pair of Jaybirds that suddenly would not charge or even turn on after less than a year.  One thing that I did notice with these, the Bluetooth sensor must be on the right side and you will want to run or carry your phone on your right arm or side.  Otherwise you do get some cutting out of the music.  It took me a couple of runs to figure this out.  And the more stationary (use an arm band vs keep in pocket) the better.  But overall these earbuds work like champs at a fraction of the price of the other big names out there.

2/10 quality, avoid for working out


The one good thing I liked was the sound could be turned much louder than many others. This is the only ""noise cancelation"" it actually has.And now for the bad.Terrible longevity. My first one quit after a couple months. Left ear went out. Common for cheap headphones. My 2nd the ear hook broke at the base in 3 weeks.Speaking of the ear hook, they're flexible which seems great, but the move too much. I wear glasses and the hook will bend out and does not hold the buds in my ear. In addition, ANY movement will cause the hooks to bend, allowing the buds to move out of the ear canal. I work out a lot, and this is obviously the reason for buying this type of headphone. Disappointed.

Meh


After having a chance to A/B these “Senso Bluetooth Earbuds” with my similarly-priced “Monoprice Large Driver Bluetooth Earbuds”, I was disappointed that these Senso’s have a much more lo-fi/compressed sound compared to the Monoprice as well as a strange, unpleasant EQ frequency profile.  I bought these Senso earbuds because my Monoprice earbuds didn’t get quite loud enough to drown out the gym sounds, however these Sensos acheive about the same volume level as the Monoprice unfortunately.I’d recommend against these Senso earbuds and suggest that most people would be much happier with the sound quality of the “Monoprice Large Driver Bluetooth Earbuds”, which are similarly priced (I bought them on sale for $11, average seems to be $15 - $20).

Great Headphones


I bought these headphones for my husband about 5 months ago. He wear these things in the morning while cooking, mowing the lawn, PTA meetings, while driving, and on camping trips. So, naturally I bought myself a pair and they are amazing. I thought maybe my husband was exaggerating, but these headphones are lightweight and very comfortable, so you can literally wear them for hours without any discomfort. I'm no music expert, but sound quality is full and detailed. The bass is not overwhelming. If you receive a call, you can talk using the microphone and it automatically starts back playing the music. They fit very snug in your ear, basically eliminating or limiting outside noise. They are compatible with any BT enabled device. Also I was able to connect to two different devices.Downside:1.The were several times I thought something was crawling on my neck. It was just the cord.2. When connecting to multiple devices, I think the headphones get confused. I found out that it will cycle through connecting between all the devices that has its BT saved. There are no options of selecting which device you want the headphones to connect to because it connects automatically once turned on. Even when I went into the device settings and manually disconnected from the headphones, they would still try to connect automatically. So I deleted the BT profile off the other devices until I needed them. That solved my issue. So now when I want to use my headphones with a different device I have to go through the pairing process and then delete it when I'm finished to connect back to my main device.3. They don't work well for bedtime use. I have to lie flat on my back. If my head turned left or right, my headphone would pop out ear. If they didn't popout then they were just uncomfortable to lie on.Overall I would purchase these headphones a dozen more times because they are really that good. The downsides are more of a personal preference and a very minor inconvenience.

Senso wired earbuds


I love these earbuds! The volume control is easy, the volume is amazing, the bass is awesome! Unfortunately, I only gave it four stars because I purchased them in February and as of October, the left ear went out ☹️... BUT I'm going to purchase a new pair because I really love the comfort of the ear hooks on my little bitty ears- not to mention the quality of the bass and volume. I highly recommend these. Hopefully, I don't have the same problem with the new pair. 🤞

Comfortable, light-weight, nice quality at a phenomenal price


These were a really good price, and I wasn't sure how the quality would be, although the reviews were generally good.  I've been using them for several weeks now, and I really like them.  They fit me well, and they are comfortable and stay in place.  The sound quality is very good, although I find that the noise-cancellation is most effective for conversation frequencies and not as much for other noise (vacuum cleaner, Nordic Track).I am very cautious about how I use them and always put them back in the case.  I think that will be critical, as it is for any earbuds, of course.  They have paired consistently and operate easily.  So far, very pleased and thinking about who on my Christmas list needs a comfortable, light-weight, nice quality pair of blue-tooth headphones.

Terrible


I didn't have high hopes for these to begin with as these sorts of headphones never seem to be spectacular products. However these might be the worst of the bunch I've owned over the years.  The over-ear pieces are way too large and are not adjustable so the fit is awkward.  It doesn't feel secure although in the interest of fairness they did stay in when I tried jumping around or shaking my head.  The fit I could live with however the bluetooth connectivity is also terrible.  For example, the sound drops out or crackles when my phone is in my pocket.  I could understand if it was dropping out because I left my phone in a different room, but from my pocket seems ridiculous.

Ok at first but bluetooth connection sucked and now it won't even connect.


They were ok.Cable is too long and annoying but otherwise they were comfortable while working or running. They however were not comfortable for everyday use which was disappointing.  I would wear them on flights or trains and found that they pinched my ears and the buds restricted my inner ear from getting any ventilation. Sound quality was ok, but I'm by no mean an expert. I just want to hear music.The biggest disappointment however was that it took forever to connect to my iPhone or iPad. Now it won't even connect at all.  It lasted basically 6 month. Not sure why it won't connect when it use to. Maybe iPhone updates. But it's still useless to me now. I'll be looking somewhere else for my music.

You Get What You Pay For...🤷🏽‍♂️


For around $20 the sound quality and noise cancellation is pretty good and as long as you don’t overcharge the headphones, they’ll last a good while, but don’t expect it to work the day after if you used it all day. Here are the problems:1. Has an annoying volume level glitch where it doesn’t line up with whatever the volume says it’s at.2. Makes an annoying ass “beep” when the volume is brought to 0% or when you use Siri.3. Has a super high volume sensitivity, unnecessarily loud at lower volume levels.Other than these major problems, some minor ones can be:1. Inside of the ear can hurt after wearing it for awhile.2. Can have trouble with sizing with ear cups.3. Wire tie included easily comes off.

I have a hard time getting buds to stay in. Maybe my ears are weird, but these work for me so I have purchased these as replacements. I like the brand. I like that they always include a little surprise extra thing in the package. . I’m am fine with the sound and the price is good.  I accidentally bought two and a good thing too because one set got tangled in my hair and the curved part got straightened out. And it would never hold a curve and fit over my ear again so the pair was useless. I’ve learned my lesson, and won’t do that again, but it is very irritating.

Negatives: Need a larger ear, overall size is large, and audio 7/10 Positives: Easy to control and wireless


These headphones were the only wrap around the ear silcone tiped earbuds I could find, and so I'm settling on these. That being said, they aren't the best sports earbuds. I dislike the wrap around the ear piece to secure the ear, the sound quality of the product and product size. I like the wireless component of this, it's convienent. Note that I use these for workouts and I'm also an audio guy, so my expectations are higher.Again, I'm not a fan of the wrap around ear piece to secure the earbud and thats because they are too large for my ears. I had to be creative using super glue and my old wrap around ear buds. the audio quality is not anything to rave about, esspecially compared to my Skull Candy earbuds. I have an older model of Skull candy earbuds that aren't advailible anymore, but I'm sure any of their products would out perform this sound wise, but not by much, just enough to notice. Yeah, my old Skull Candy's are wired and these are wireless, but I've head better wireless sound. My last objection is the size of the unit, they are faily large.The few things I enjoy about this unit is the wireless connection and the ability to control volume, take calls etc.. all form the earbuds. I've found the wireless connection to work well, despite the possible sound quality reduction. You can walk a solid five feet before disconnecting. That works for me. Secondly, I enjoy the ability to control volume and not dig my phone out my pocket everytime.

Here's why I love them. I've now run 10 miles with them


Got these this week. Here's why I love them. I've now run 10 miles with them, and I've had to touch them when I put them on and when I take them off...NOT when I'm running!!!They're pretty hyped in the low end, but that's partially because they just do a great job of sealing off the ear. I have had 20 sets of headphones for running. These are the most comfortable so far.As long as they don't quit working in a month, I'll call this a 5 star product, especially considering the price.The only negative I've found so far is that the voice that tells you when your headphones are on and connected sounds like an angry astronaut sending a blotchy transmission from the moon, but it's such a minor thing I can't take away any stars. Super happy.

Good earbuds for the price.


I just received these earbuds today. Just wanted to leave a review to confirm some of the other reviews in case you're looking through the reviews and see conflicting information. I workout 5x a week and have ruined 4 pairs of wired earbuds within a year so I decided to get these.Pros: They are lightweight and the sound is pretty good for this price. I don't think the bass is too much on these. Comes with plenty of accessories and a nice carrying case. They pair easily.Cons: As other reviewers have said, the wing tip is pretty much useless. It's just for decoration and does nothing to keep the earbuds in your ear. However, the earbuds are light and won't fall off so it isn't a real ""con."" Plenty of eartipd and a foam eartip for people with different ear size. Choose the one that best fits you and you shouldn't have any problem with it falling out.Hope that helped!

Great Headphones!


I was using similar headphones by Beats for the last 1.5 years but they recently broke.  These ones sound exactly the same to me and are actually quite a bit more comfortable.  The piece that goes in your ear is SUPER soft and the part that goes around it is, too.  I have tiny ears so the Beats actually would hurt me sometimes.  These ones do not.  My ONLY issue with these is that the piece that goes around your ear is a little TOO soft and doesn't feel like it's really holding on.  HOWEVER, I was able to workout as usual (including jump squats and plank jacks) without any issue whatsoever.  Perhaps the rigidity of the outer earpiece doesn't matter as much as I thought!  I would buy these again and feel like for the price it's a way better purchase than Beats.

Great quality for the price


I bought these for the occasional work in our machine shop, as I didn't even want to have the possibility of a cable snag pulling my phone out of my pocket near the lathe. With the cord behind my neck I never have to worry about a cord catching on things, and I can keep the ports on my phone pointed down (keeps metal dust out of them). I also wanted an in-ear headphone, as they can reduce some of the machine noise so that I don't have to wear hearing protection over them, and that has worked out for ""relatively"" quiet machines like the mill and lathe. Unfortunately they do not fit under my actual hearing protection, but I only need that for a few machines.The sound quality was surprisingly good, and while they don't beat my $90 over ear corded ones at home I use for gaming, they do an excellent job overall. I'll listen to music for 3-6 hours a day, depending on what I'm working on, and I've never had them run out of battery. Overall I was supremely impressed by these, and they are on me at all times now. The case is also super handy, as I use it for my spare charging cable and some disposable earplugs.

Great sound, comfortable fit, reasonable recharge time.


Great sound, reasonable recharge time, very comfortable fit. You can choose how deeply you shove these into your ear canal for either near total isolation or mere presence in the field of ambient environmental sounds, and this also enables you to avoid ear fatigue when you need a lighter physical pressure on your ear canals. The red-to-blue charge LED is very useful. The buttons on the right earpiece... meh. They work, but mostly I use these ear goggles whilst sitting, for privacy reasons, and so use the host computer's volume controls. I've no experience using them during strenuous physical activity. Physical range for full function is limited to about three meters, but that is more a feature than a problem with unsecured bluetooth devices in my opinion.

I took a chance on these after trying out the Powerbeats2 since I was a bit disappointed with the latter's performance for the price.  I haven't used bluetooth headphones in a while and I was disappointed with how often the Powerbeats2 were cutting out.  And I'm not talking about situations where I move away from the source, I'm talking about when I have my phone in my pocket.  I also didn't think they stayed in my ear as well as regular earbuds (the hooked part actually kind of prevented the bud from staying deep in my ear, which is how I prefer it so as to isolate outside sound better).I've had the SENSO model for a few months now and have decided to keep them because they don't cut out as often or enough to bother me.  As for the sound, they're not as good as the beats especially in the bass department, but they're decent enough.  After all I'm mostly using these on the go or in the gym so with other background noises/distractions I'm not expecting a perfect audio experience.  I find they also sometimes don't stay fully deep in my ear.  I may be able to find a better bud for this however, as I know this can play a factor.The biggest actual issues that bring this down besides the sound quality especially compared to Powerbeats are the ear hooks and cable.  While the Powerbeats hooks are somewhat firm the SENSO hooks are extremely floppy.  The former were easy to hook on and stay there while the latter requires finagling to get them in place and they don't always stay there.  Also with Powerbeats you get a clasp to adjust the cable length but there is none of that with SENSO so the extra slack moves all over the place.Ultimately for the price these have been getting the job done for me.  I would be willing to pay a bit more for Powerbeats with the better sound and fitting aspects, but you must decide for yourself if the huge price difference is justifiable, especially at risk of connectivity issues.  Also since I use these in the gym a lot I didn't want to spend a lot on something that I might break/get wet.

**UPDATE** Replaced and the replacement is now broken


Easy to use, great audio quality, stays in place just fine, long battery life. Mine unfortunately stopped working all of a sudden after about 8 months, but customer service was great and very fast in replacing them since it was still under warranty. I can't speak to the headphone's longevity otherwise. But when they're working, they're a great product.UPDATE: It's been 7 months using the replacement and they now have the same exact issue. They worked fine this morning for my workout. I hooked them up to charge after and 20 minutes later the indicator light was off. I unhooked them and reseated the cable, no indicator light. I tried to turn them on. Nothing. They're dead. I will update again after I hear back from seller Tekatron.

Decent pair of bluetooth headphones with some connection issues


I purchased these during a ""one day"" sale.  Funny that's it called a one day sale as it's still on sale now as the same price as when I purchased it.  I am impressed with the amount of accessories that they provide with the headphones.  You get a nice quality hard case along with a cigarette lighter charger with two usb inputs and some additional ear plugs.  You also get a short usb cord but there wasn't a regular plug outlet which was surprising.  The sound is above average and you get decent bass.  They fit well and I never have to adjust them when exercising.  The controls are located directly on the right earphone so it may be awkward for some folks.  I've accidentally hung up on people during calls when I've tried to adjust my volume.  I could also attribute that to user error.  I had had some connection issues with my iPhone 6S where the headphones will randomly disconnect but then reconnect.  I also have occasional issues with crackling but only rarely.Battery life is good and I can get through most of the day before I have to charge them.  I'd estimate the actual battery life with mixed calls (50%) and listening to music (50%) at about 6 hours.If wouldn't purchase these at full price (allegedly $160 or so) but if you get these for $50 or less, it's a good deal.

Would not recommend.


I originally had the Cheetah wireless headphones and they were good, the problem was I lost them. When I was ready to purchase another pair of wireless headphones I decided to spend a little more money hoping for better sound quality but instead I got a product that was worse than the cheaper ones I previously had. Sound quality was average, the cord connecting the two headphones is too long in my opinion, but the worst part is that I used them about 5 times after owning them for almost 6 months because they were always dead when I needed them and I had always charged them ahead of time. I later found out that they are charged and have 90% but they turn off on their own after being connected to my iPhone for not even 60 seconds. I would not recommend these headphones because they don't work anymore after minimal use.

Great for at the gym with good sound, impressive volume, fair battery life, and comfort.


I am into these headphones. I got a great deal through amazon. They are small enough to keep in a pocket. Charges with a cell phone cord. Charge last atleast a week at the gym working out 1 hour per day. Easy enough to pair and use. the red ear pads that come with it have a memory foam feel and are really comfortable. Unfortuantely I lost one and the spare pads that are included are silicone and not nearly as nice. Be careful as the soft covers do come off.- Great for at the gym when you want to be wireless- Gets much louder than my iphone ear buds- Battery last a fair amount of time- Sound quality is pretty good given bluetooth and ear buds- Only negative is that the covers that cushion your ear can easly be lost.

Great for the money.


Awesome for the price. Overall sound quality is bass heavy for sure, but not a deal breaker for me, depends on your choice of music.The included accessories don’t matter to me much. The multi end charger cord is pretty cool, a little short to be an all the time use. The carry case is a nice touch, but stuffing the buds and cord and charging cable is beyond my patience. Would definitely be better off with a typical round cord between the buds, not a fan of the flat ribbon cord.If you use the squishy foam ends they work well at keeping out ambient noise, almost too much for speech though.I use them exclusively around the house for mowing the lawn, weed wacking, and snowblowing come winter. Have no issue with them falling out.

Best first impression - Product failed Warranty and service is 100% reliable -


Excellent first impression.  Over many years, since the Walkman I run with music on a daily basis.  That means many hours a year... over the years I have used many brands and types of earphones... I keep searching for one that lasts at least a year... I have high hopes for this one.  I just got them today  and everything looks and sounds good.  We will see how it evolves as the miles unfold.First month and everything working perfectly, great battery duration and the best part is that you get a verbal notification that the battery is running low as oppose to other brands that just simply die on the middle of a run. So far so good but we still have 11 months to go...Review update... after having a 5 star I will have to dowgrade it to 1... today 8.5.17 I am not able to turn on the headphones, there is no red light when plugged to the electrical outlet in simple words:  dead headphones.  Almost 5 months of enjoying an excellent product, too bad is not made to last even 6 months...I was feeling pretty frustated and decided to contact Amazon Customer Service to have my headphones replaced since there is a 1 year warranty.  I understand that a production line is not able to produce 100% quality products,  and I will hope that my first headphones simply went on the wrong side of the statics. Amazon CS  were not able to replace them in the first place due to their third pary replacement policy. Amazon CS  suggested me to contact SENSO directly and they unfortunatelly gave me  the wrong information. I went direclty to the SENSO website and filed the claim.  Amazon came back to me and offered me a solution, they issued a refund and suggested me to buy the headphones back so they could ship it ASAP and assume the shipping expenses.  I proceeded and meanwhile SENSO also answered my claim, they noticed the refund and  my new purchase of the new set, they appologize for the inconvenience and issued a 10% discount on the replacement purchase.Overall I want to make clear that as a customer I fill backed up by both companies, there is no more you can ask for.  Rate is up to 5 stars again!I am now a happy camper, running again with the SENSO headphones, which by the way have improved with a new earbud design!  Will hear from me as time advances.

Buy These Earbuds--You won't be sorry!!


After tirelessly scanning the Internet and checking all the wireless earbuds on Amazon, I finally decided on purchasing the Senso Bluetooth headphones/earbuds.  I was not given any discount or freebie-I paid the full price.  I had bought some knock-off Beats Bluetooth over the ear headphones at a Flea Market (not knowing they were knock-offs at the time of purchase) and was very unhappy with them. Unlike the Beats, the Senso earbuds were easy to connect to my iPhone and were already charged when I took them out of their case.  The over the ear silicon ear hook was surprisingly soft and comfortable. The sound was great!  My workout went great at the gym without worrying about the headphones sliding around on my head!  They are so light that you hardly know they are in your ear.  I have only had them less than a week, but I am very impressed.  The packaging was awesome!  It comes with two charging cables. One is a short one and the other is longer and has two different connectors; one for Iphone and one for the earbuds (micro-b) It also comes with a dual car charger and great little round carrying case.  Don't waste your time reviewing tons of reviews and looking at hundreds of earbuds-- buy these!  The SENSO buds are great!

Great earbuds for the price, and support service is excellent


I was worried from the beginning that a cheap pair of earbuds would stop working, and sure enough they did. They no longer hold a charge and I've tried what the manual has said related to the earbuds not charging. Other than that, the earbuds themselves are fine - they are worth the price. They have good quality sound and are comfortable. Pairing is simple enough, and any connective issues I had were solved by forgetting the device in my phone's Bluetooth settings and reconnecting. However, the fact that they stopped working after 5 months of light everyday use is extremely disappointing. However, as disappointed as it was, their support service is phenomenal. I received a reply to my email the same day, and within 2 days I already had a replacement coming in. Senso genuinely means it when they say 1 year warranty. This product is terrific for the price, and nobody should be worried about theirs going bad since they can get a new pair within the same week.

Eventually they will fail, but the company does honor the one-year warranty.


I have bought 5 of these headphones. One for me, three for my children, and one because I suck at paying attention to how much of something I'm ordering.I'm not going to comment too much on the quality or the sound and all that. I am no expert. For the price (on sale at the time I purchased) I found it to a big bang for the buck. They worked well (enough), they weren't perfect, but for roughly 40 bucks a pop, I don't think I could have hoped for better.Occasionally had issues with connecting to Bluetooth (but that could be the wonkiness of other systems involved)Audio 'skipped' sometimes.Generally had no issues though.Point is I was happy with them. So were my kids.But, as all things are wont to do, eventually they failed. As in, every single one of the headphones stopped functioning completely. Well, one didn't get the chance, a dog chewed them up. But the rest that lived long enough to flourish eventually gave up the ghost.The number that comes with the box, with its 24/7 support and minimal wait times (all pluses*) they will walk you through the basics of how to reset the device. If it is deemed faulty, they will replace the headphones with minimal fuss. It is pretty great.BUT!! Keep in mind that the 'one-year-warranty' does not 'restart' with the replacements. If those fail outside of the original time-frame, no replacement will be given. This might be common sense to some, but one can dream can't they?CAN'T THEY!?!?All-in-all, 40 bucks for a decent pair of headphones that get a hassle-free replacement that all together is over a year of use is all gravy to me.No.More than gravy... gravy AND biscuits.I will probably purchase again.*....ew. The plural for 'plus' looks badEdit: Holy Hell, I didn't realize the price has gone down even further. Yeah, for 20~ definitely worth it.

WORKS WELL WHEN IT WORKS, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE


Great product . For the price the sound quality is excellent . Connectivity can be a bit clunky  and can disconnect at time depending on your device but nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to Bluetooth . Functionality is great and easy , alongside with a decent battery life of 8 hours (for me that’s about 3 full workouts ) the issue was that it did not last long as it stopped turning on and charging . However the product gets 5 stars still because when it works it’s awesome but thanks to their super responsive customer service they’ll be sending me a replacement (within my 1 year warranty ) I will say this is due part of a faulty unit as most of the reviews here match my experience with it when it was working . Going through customer service was no hassle at all - all tthough very quick responding email . If you need a gear pair of workout headphones that won’t break your bank, grab these !

Awesome. Sound is really good, which I am particular about. When running you can hear the wind blowing so adjust them carefully


Awesome and the sound is really good, which I am particular about. Wear these for running in the morning and listing to webcasts, etc. When running you can hear the wind blowing by but just adjust them to minimize the rustling sound. You won't eliminate it completely. Also tried to use for a conference call but was told it was difficult to hear me so check your other device volume in advance. This is only a secondary concern, as for me it was running and listening that I bought them for. 2 thumbs up.Update: Feb 21st Have now used these for several Webcast/Skype meetings and the audience could here me clearly which is great..... They also warn you when the battery is low. Have found the rubber insert/cover for the charging port difficult to open but this is a minor inconvenience. Overall 5 stars

but I am certainly satisfied today with this purchase


Just barely got these earbuds so I cannot vouch for warranty, battery life, or durability yet.  However, I just had to write a review for probably the most important quality for earphones -- sound quality.  Once I got these buds paired with my phone and started up my Spotify account, I was blown away.  At about 1/3 volume, these headphones were crystal clear.  At 1/2 volume, they were definitely loud enough.  And the bass, WOW.  I will consider adding to this review after I have used them for a longer period of time and will update the review to take into consideration the durability and battery life, but I am certainly satisfied today with this purchase.  Lots of extras and great sound.Time will tell if this was a good buy.

Best pair of wireless headphones at it's price point


Had these for 4 months now, and they've been the best pair I've had at this price point.Pros:- Good battery life, I usually only need to charge every other day or so- Earbuds EASILY stay in, not a chance of them falling out due to the around-the-ear clip, great for running- Really good sound indoors or on vehicles (where there's no wind)- Once the bluetooth is synced to the phone/laptop, it automatically syncs every time on power-up, no issues there.Cons:- Loud wind sounds when running/cycling, but at the same time better situational awareness of sounds, so not the worst.- Low-battery beep sound is confusing and annoying, took me weeks to figure out what was going on.- Sometimes it has a phantom disconnect/reconnect to bluetooth which has a jarring ""DISCONNECTED/CONNECTED"" voice.

Great Product


Edit#1:  The company has reached out and taken the action to ship me a new set.  Will further update the review when I op test the new set.Edit#2:  I have received the replacement unit and it functions perfectly.  It immediately paired and maintained its pair for a 40 minute run.  Thanks to SENSO for standing behind their product.Original:I have had this product for a month, and cannot give it more than one star. I will give the manufacturer credit for fantastic packaging.  It came with a very nice storage case, charge cable, thunderbolt cable, and car USB adapter.  All of those products look great and function as expected, with the exception of the thunderbolt cable being unable to charge an iPad.However, the earbuds themselves simply don't work.  In more than 15 workout sessions I have never managed to have the earbuds hold a stable uplink with my phone (iPhone 6s).  I have tried everything I can think of.  I wear my phone on my right arm, so as to be as close to the receiving earbud as possible, and the connection still constantly cuts in and out.  I have never used them at less than a full charge.  I have tried these with multiple devices, Android and Apple, with no success.  They have been nothing but a distraction, which is definitely not the point of wearing earbuds during a workout.Spend a few dollars more.  No matter how much these cost the value is still zero if they don't work.

Best headphones for the price


This is the second time I have purchased these (the first time I accidentally left them in my pants that I tossed in the wash, and I am once again highly impressed by the quality of the headphones and all the features you get with it. I have tried several new, even more expensive, headphones since accidentally ruining my first pair of SENSOs. Nothing compared to my SENSO pair that I had, so here I am again ... rebuying the same item I bought about a year ago. This is as good as it gets for $20, and I would say it destroys even more expensive competition. High quality in every way.

These are nice headsets for the price


These are nice headsets for the price.  I had the equivalent Beats version that I took back after a week as they would  not hold a charge well and would randomly drop connection 10-15 seconds at a time.  I have not had this problem with the SENSO brand.  These sound just as good (though I am sure some audiophiles would debate that).  The only thing I can say negative is that if you face into the wind, they do capture a good bit of wind noise.  I tried different size earbud covers but still got the wind noise.  Im going to ding it a star for that aspect.  One other MINOR inconvenience is the rubbery nature of the band that connects the ear buds.  The band seems to ""grip"" your collar or skin at times so that when you turn your head they can pull tension on one side or the other.  In some cases, I have pulled one side out of my ear just by turning my head and not paying attention to if the cord was balanced evenly on my neck.  The solution to this was just to drape the cord in the front.

They honor their warranty!


I had these headphones for just shy of a year and used them almost every day at the gym, and around the house so I can listen to music while I clean.  A few weeks before the 12 month warranty expired, the left earbud started having problems.  Sometimes there would be static, other times there would be no sound at all.I contacted the company through their seller page to discuss the issue.  They got back to me within a few hours with some troubleshooting ideas.  When none of those worked, I asked if I could send back the headphones for a new pair, considering I was still within the warranty window.  They said that they would send a new pair out -- and they did!  In less than a week from emailing them with my problems to receiving my brand new pair of blue tooth headphones in the mail via Amazon.I am so impressed at how their customer service handled this issue, and how they stood by their warranty (even though I was only a week or so shy of that 12 month deadline!) that I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again.  And the headphones are awesome, too.

it's useless. 2)


Also the sound quality deserves 5-star, there are serious flaws with this headset: 1) BT connection is not solid when riding the bike and the phone is in the short pocket and moving.  You have to carry your phone in front pocket; otherwise, it's useless.  2). Promised 33 feet range may work only if you have the line of sight.  If you have a phone around the corner - even 10 ft away - the connection is not steady.  3) Aerodynamics are bad: the is very load whistles if you try to listen while wind is blowing ( even 20 m/h wind overrides the music).I cannot understand why people are so happy with this set:  after all, it failed the test for most outdoor activities.The set sits comfortably on your ears but noise cancellation is next to none.  I had other phones doing better job and costing less.I may keep it because the sound is great:  rich treble and deep bass.

Trucker's buddy


The folks at SENSO are very courteous. They wanted to be sure I had received the headphones & how I was treated & liked them. I work out of an 18-wheeler tanker truck 12 hours a day & I'm a senior citizen. Many of us talk to & help each other through out the day. The wired headset I had for my phone worked sometimes but most of the time not. These are 1000 times better. Once I left my phone in the truck, a call came in & I answered it from the back of the tanker over 30 feet away. Some guys wear the headsets with an external mic. I prefer the integrated mic. With the smallest buds on, I can wear these 12 hours & don't feel them. Next I need to get my sons to show me how to put music on my phone so I can listen to it when not talking oilfield-trucker talk to my co-workers. No more CB radio.

Decent when they work. Spend a little more to get better quality


I had a pair of Sony Bluetooth ear buds but lost them  They were 100$ And didn't want to spend that again. so I looked at these and red the reviews and thought I would give them a try I was gonna get them tomorrow (Monday) but they came Friday which I was excited about. I use them for when I'm at work for 8 hours and sweat a lot in the summer time. After listening to some music it has plenty of base for my taste but some songs it's hard to hear the words so I'll need to play with the equalizer to figure what's best for my taste. People Seem to have problems hearing my voice while talking on the phone I sound far away they say. my sonys people could hear me better and I didn't have to talk as loud. These senso don't fall out my ear either but comes with plenty of different ear pieces to fit your ear also. It has a case car charger and cord and a regular cord to charge it..... now I've had them for about 3-4 months it disconnects from my phone and when I turn it off it has a deep voice instead of a woman's voice and the same turning it on. I did have a very high pitched like chipmunk voice when turning off once. There seems to be a problem with the Bluetooth itself. After charging it and turning on it connects and works for a minute or two then disconnects and then repeats. After spending $37 I would rather have spend the money on the pair of sonys I had that I never had a problem with after having them for 6 months but lost them.

Works intermittently, often requires restart.


Edited: I have upgraded my rating from 2 stars to 5. When I wrote about a problem here, Senso support contacted me and helped me fix the problem. I've been slow to edit my review, but they were quick with service. Very pleased.Pro: Stay in the ear pretty nicely. Deliver good sound when they deliver sound.Con: Don't deliver sound. (Edit 5/22/18: This problem has been solved.) Will signal that they are connected. But often they don't deliver any sound. Clicking the button will pause or unpause the application that's trying to deliver sound. You can hear this because the sound is coming from the phone's speakers. (iPhone 6+ in my case). But no sound comes through the earbuds. Restarting either the earbuds or the app will fix the problem, but sometimes it requires several restarts in order to fix the problem. In the meantime, you're annoying the people around you with sound from the phone's speaker. I would have been delighted with this product if not for this serious failing.

I am surprised how good these headphones are. I received a pair of Bose  $150 sport headphones for Christmas and they will not stay on your ear. The Quality is terrific but they fall off. I've been unhappy with my jawbone for my iPhone seven as you know it has a rubber earpiece the keeps wearing out and sound quality is hit or miss.I just bought and received Bluetooth Headphone,KUPPET Mini Wireless Earphone. Nice package looks great you can't hear anybody on the phone. I give it D.So I thought I would try the Senso with my iPhone for making/ receiving calls. Surprise it works great.

Decent while they work, small parts break with little use though.


My initial impressions of these earbuds were good. The sound quality was OK for hitting the gym, they didn't get especially dirty, they were comfortable to wear, and had a good array of adjustments for a good fit.I've used them maybe two to three times a week for an hour at a time, and they keep a charge for weeks at a time providing they're turned off when not in use.My problem, however, is that only a month after the return window expires the up-volume button has completely jammed. I can no longer turn my music up from the earbuds, it has to be done from my phone now.Volume down works fine, but not up... Very disappointing in how little I used them before something so simple broke on them.I'll be going with a more familiar brand next time around, and I won't be buying these again.In my defense, I am not hard on electronics. I've never broken anything since I was 16, the button breaking on this was a design flaw, not from any kind of abuse in daily use.Overall, good presentation, good aesthetic, ok sound quality, bad design quality. Won't buy again.

Great pair of headphones for running


My previous set up for running involved a wired Sennheiser sports headphone set that went behind my head with a cord that was just long enough to reach to my phone on my left bicep. With the new bluetooth headphones that have come out, I wanted to see if I could find a solution that would work with running.These had great reviews and were cheap, so I gave them a try. When I first tried them on at my kitchen table, I thought they were a bit bulky and heavy. However, when I went out with them on my first run, they were very comfortable and I quickly stopped noticing them on my ears. The only thing that I really noticed was the cord lying on the back of my neck.The controls are easy to use and reach, and the sound is good. Also hard to argue with the price!

Best bang for your buck!


After checking out other people's comments on how good these headphones were I decided to take the plunge. These are my first BT headphones. I just started hitting the gym again and I was  for something that didn't tie my cord to my phone.  I also didn't want to spend 100 bucks.  These headphones are everything everyone says they are at a great price.  I charged them when I got them and I've worked out for a whole week without recharging them so the battery life is great.  Only time will tell if they hold up but so far so good.  I loved the little extras like the Cigarette charger and the extra tips it makes the package well worth the cost.  I would recommend this product for somebody looking for a Bluetooth headset that's not gonna break the bank.

My SENSO Bluetooth headphones arrived when scheduled and packed very nicely. After reading the instructions, I charged them and paired with my phone. Everything went just as explained. I was surprised at the sound and product quality. The only problem I had was turning them off and going to bed.If you're looking around for wireless ear buds keep in mind that these come with everything you need and then some. I noticed that similar products didn't include the case, charger and spare ear pieces. purchasing all the extras separately would make the others much more expensive.The company emailed me to check on my satisfaction. I was very impressed with their customer service. I would not hesitate to recommend them to everyone. I'm looking forward to using them often.

Affordable, great value, sometimes stutter...


I use my SENSO Wireless Bluetooth Headphones all the time when I am working out.  I use them for running and in the gym and I think they do a very nice job overall.  They are comfortable, have decent sound, good bass, stay in place for the most part, a good battery life, and are easy to operate.The reason I did not give the 5 stars is because on a fairly frequent basis they do stutter their connection for some unknown reason. The instructions say they can be a fairly good distance from the device they are being streamed from but I can be right next to the device and they will still do it.  It happens frequently enough (1 out of 5 times usually) to be annoying.  For the price I'm not going to have a hissy fit...  But I cannot give them 5 stars.  I still feel like they are well worth 4 stars and would still recommend them.

Great fit and affordable for what it does.


Great fit.  I run 3-5 miles a day and do interval training, and they never come loose.  Bass is pretty good as well as loudness.  Works great with my Samsung Edge.  Also, the wire fits nicely around the neck or tucked into your shirt.  The ear clip is a nice soft rubber that I barely feel.Not sweat-proof but may be sweat-resistant.  Found a few times having to wipe the unit down in order to get even sound.There is no reason to spend a fortune for headphones for working out.  They are sort of meant to be replaceable eventually anyway.  If you're in the studio mixing tracks, then, of course, yes this is going to matter, but in the gym or outside, I just want to hear my music loudly and with a broad frequency spectrum.  This will do it.

Gym and sweat approved


It's currently September 2019, I bought these in November 2018. I bought these to use at the gym and running. They still work amazing after using it everyday and holds up to sweating. Haven't loss any quality in sound and hardware. The earphones stay in my ear without having to adjust. The battery works great. I work out for an hour and I can use these for 5-6 consecutive days in the gym. Since I use it only for this purpose, it's a great product for me and for the price. For relaxing, I prefer wired earphones because of the amazing quality that you just can't beat. Hope this helps someone.

Buyer beware! Not for running, walking to work at best but not for running.


Not for running, 30 ft signal broadcast radius: Try 2 ft max! Sound suppression is non existent unless you count raising the volume of the earbuds to the max level, which btw is not very loud. I tried running with these and the audio consistently cut out with every single footfall. I tried re-positioning the mp3 device from my back pocket to my front pocket. Still got audio cutout. I took the device out of my pocket and held it in my hand...no audio cutout.  The only way these piece of technological marvels work is if the device you have it paired to is within 2 feet of the earbuds and not causing vibrations stronger than just walking.

No more cord!


So far, so good. I like them, and they are easy to use. I've only used them one time so I can't comment about battery life or other issues that may crop up. The buttons are easy to use and understand. I just have to get used to how to adjust it in my ear without touching the buttons, but that will come with a little more use. I did have a problem with set up using the supplied 3 foot charging cord, but a quick call to customer service solved the issue. The first connector is for the phone. You have to slide the unit apart to reveal the connector for the headphones. A more technical person probably would have realized that. But I am very happy with the wireless set up and the comfort of the ear pieces. No more cord getting in the way of my workouts.

Lesson Learned


Before I purchased Senso, I purchased my first pair of wireless headphones for a friend a few weeks ago. Seemed like a great idea, so I got another pair for myself as well. When I went for a run, they continuously fell off my ears, and sounded muffled. Then less than an hour later, they  needed to be recharged. I knew I’d never use them again and was sorry I had purchased a pair for my friend.I looked at different wireless brands in the electronics store, but the prices were insane. Some as high as $300.00.I went online and saw Senso and thought I’d give it a try.The Senso Ear Buds are excellent! I was so happy with the fit, the sound, the price and the accessories that I immediately purchased a 2nd pair for my friend. I can’t imagine purchasing anything else.

Great value.


I don't leave many reviews, but I feel compelled to comment on these headphone since I'm so pleasantly surprised at the quality on offer at this price point.  There are a number quite nice headphones at even $30-40, but closer to $20 you're more likely to find tinny, lackluster garbage, especially for wireless headphones.  Though these cannot compete with some of the more expensive wired Shure and Etymotics headphones I own for overall sound quality, they hold their own remarkably well at ~1/5 the price.  Bass is overrepresented, which is not my preference, but what's there is not muddy; rather, it's surprisingly full, and it gives a lot of full sized headphones a run for its money. Sound isolation is moderate; these aren't earplug style headphones and they let in some outside noise, but there is definitely a significant reduction.  I can't verify the advertised battery life, but I get through a full day of heavy use no problem, and the controls are all conveniently located.  I've been using them much more than I initially expected despite owning several more expensive sets of earbuds with objectively better audio quality, as these are good enough for a lot of listening and more convenient.  I'd be happy with them at twice the price; at around twenty bucks they're an absolute steal.

Buy These, Don't Hesitate!


I was skeptical about buying these $23.97 Bluetooth headphones, but the first day I tried them I have loved them since (a year later)! These are perfect. They're light weight, & fit to my ear (had extra fittings) that don't fall out during intense running.  They have a warranty, and come with a nice case to carry them around (though honestly I just throw them in my bag and they're safe!  I also use them at work, usually just putting one plug in and hanging the other one around my collar.  Great sound, great quality. I love that I can change songs and the volume with a touch or two of a button.  The battery isn't super long, maybe 45 minutes max, but that's really all I need them for.  I can walk across the room without my phone, but can't go too far.  I have only ran out of battery once during a long day at work.  The charge time is fast, so not much of a worry!  I would buy these as a gift and recommend them to family and friends.  I'd pay more money for this quality!

Tremendous value with exceptional features


I have used the SENSO headphones now for several weeks now in my daily fast walks. At first, the controls seem a little difficult to find (they are really small) but once you get used to it, they are fine. The instruction diagram is also very small, and not easy to follow. Haven't had any incoming calls so far, so no feedback on this. The main thing however, is that the phones are light, comfortable, remain in place when fast walking, and produce good sound with excellent stereo separation. Possibly a little heavy on the bass, but that could be my high frequency hearing loss. The only small thing is that there are occasional momentary sound level reductions lasting for about a second (on both radio stations, Slacker & Pandora). Don't think it is a Bluetooth glitch, but is not really an issue I am concerned with.I would definitely recommend them (have bought two sets).Tremendous value with exceptional features.

Good headphones.


I bought a pair for use at work, so I cannot comment on using them in an athletic sense. It is nice to leave my phone in my desk and not have to worry about catching the cord on anything. While in use I am generally no more than 20 feet from my desk and cut out from distance has yet to ever happen.I use them to listen to music, podcasts, and audio books, exclusively. I do not use them for phone calls so I have no input on that.The bass is surprisingly 'bassy' which is entirely welcome. The sound quality in general is every bit as good as a pair of wired headphone I paid twice the cost of these for.I get probably right around eight hours use out of them before needing to charge them.They connect via Bluetooth quickly and stay connect so no problems there.The button placement, and usage are fine as well.They are comfortable to wear, which is a big plus because I have kind of small ears, and its usually an issue with other headphones.All in all, these deserve five stars especially since they are on $30.

these seems to have one of the better sound qualities


Of the several inexpensive Chinese BT head sets I have tried, these seems to have one of the better sound qualities, however, the over-the-ear loops don't do anything, they are too high to rest on my particular ear profile.  Nothing unusual there, just an average white male.  Returning these instead of getting plastic surgery.  Really disappointed that the ear hook cannot be adjusted, should have some sort of embedded bendable memory structure, or an alternate (smaller) ear hook.Bought these ear buds for the gym, hoping they would stay in place for running on the treadmill, etc., but the only thing holding them in place is the ear bug themselves.I just got a pair of Anker SoundBuds Sport NB10, these seems stay in place very well when active.  Will be trying at the gym this week.

""Low cost - high quality"" it seems Senso ActivBuds are a Unicorn!


So far I am beyond pleased! Not only was the cost much better than  other comparables on the market my Senso Activbuds are exceptionally clear! I don't know what I expected I guess because the cost was reasonable I just assumed they would work crappy. Honestly I could not believe how easy these were to install and how well and comfortably they fit around my ears, plus I love that these came with three separate sizes for the ear inserts, not to mention all the little gadgets - like an additional charger for my iPod - fantastic! The truth is I usually don't even like to give reviews unless a product is exceptional and thus far this one is so I will just say don't bother wasting hundreds on the larger name-brand competitors because Senso works perfectly!

Bang for the Buck and then some...


I've enjoyed better sound acoustics with other corded earbuds, like Beats, but it is still very good, especially for wireless. The sound quality is better than some expensive earbuds I've tried and not too far below the better ones I've used. I waited a little bit to test durability and so far, it's holding up well. The ear hooks are a little too floppy but having a hard hook would probably be uncomfortable. I've used it at the gym and so far, it's kept up with me. You will get static if it is too far away from you. Despite, what it says in the informational booklet, you do not have 3 feet of coverage. I don't believe it gives you the full 8 hours of playtime but I do fast forward and answer calls frequently so that may take up some life. I can go through the day without having to charge, which is about 3 hours of play time; however, I would not be able to go through 2 full days, maybe 1.5. It gives you some choices in size of silicone ear pieces, depending on whether you want more bass. Only 3 choices, but that's enough for me. I do highly recommend them, especially for the price. This is now my go to buds going forward. I find no need to go back to corded sets. If they last over a year, I will consider them fantastic as some of my expensive buys have not even lasted a full year.

Good product, great customer service


Edit: I recently had to contact customer service because of an issue with these. Not only was the service friendly but it was SPEEDY. All communications happened in the same morning and my replacement earbuds were shipped out that same day.This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds and I have to say I'm enjoying the experience. The product is easy to configure and is an overall great pair of earbuds. The part that goes over the ear is very comfortable and I appreciate that even more since I typically dislike the type of buds that go into the ear. I get about 7 hours continual use with each charge. It blocks the sounds of the office perfectly, sometimes a little too well. These are also a MUST for me in the gym. It keeps me focused on my workout and not the sounds around me.

Great Value - Great Sound


Love these!  First set arrived and, while they did work, when charging the red light never came on.  Contacted customer support and they said send 'em back and they would replace them.  Not only did they replace them, but Amazon sent the replacement set before the original had actually returned to them.  Gotta love that kind of support.  New set work perfectly.  I wear them when cutting my lawn.  Sound is great (not much bass, but what can you expect from such small speakers) and I have no issues hearing them over my mower.  I am very happy and would recommend these to anyone in the market for an inexpensive wireless headset solution!

Ok sound, bulky case, would prefer USB-C charging port


The headphones sound ok but I noticed they were tinny with no bass.  I had to play around with the equalizer on my Android music app to get a better sound.  I'm using a Pixel XL with PowerAmp.The case is nice and solid but it's bulky.  No way is the average person going to carry that in their pocket.  It a circular case with a 3 1/2"" diameter and is 1 1/2"" thick.I really like when you turn these off it makes a voice announcement in the buds.  My prior headset it was always hard to tell if I shut them down or not because there was no verbal indicator.I was disappointed that they don't use a USB-C port for charging.  When are these manufactures going to realize USB-C is the new standard.  There is a red LED on the headset to indicate when it's charging.

Get off your butt and be cool, you idiot


My review stars are based on what they are for the price and for how much ass it gets you. Dont just take it from me, ask your mom. Don't go expecting Bose quality or anything. I've had these for almost 2 years now and they're still going strong like aids. I run allot for work. I've never had them die or stop working for any reason. But don't run a marathon and get mad at me cuz your slow ass can't run over 26 miles in a fast enough time to still have some music. I don't keep them in the case. I'm not gentle with them. I do clean built up earwax out of the removable ear bud peice. Running for over an hour is enough running for me. Plus I got knee problems, but I don't think that comes with the headphones.

Incredible quality for the price!


Right when I opened the Amazon brown box and saw the packaging I new these were going to be a quality set of earphones. Opening up the sturdy packaging presents you with yet another well designed carrying case that contains the earphones and all of the extra bits for swapping the ear tips and cable management. To top it all off, they've included what seems to be a really quality cable that can be switched between micro USB and thunderbolt for Android or iPhone users.Now on to the quality of the headphones themselves: the construction is very nice. I wasn't sure of the ear loops (?) because they looked a bit floppy at first look but they perform their function very well while maintaining comfort. The button operation is very straightforward and easy once you go through the initial reading for it. And finally, the sound quality is pretty amazing. The bass can seem a tiny bit muddy at times but at this price point the sound could be considered excellent. My girlfriend has the Jaybird Bluetooth headphones which are much more expensive and there really isn't much of a difference in the sound quality. The button operation is also better on these Senso phones, in my opinion.

Loved them... for about 4 months


Edit: Senso ended up contacting me after finding out my previous set went out and had me do some troubleshooting to test it it just needed a factory reset. It turned out to be a bad set, so Senso sent me a new set and I couldn't be happier with their customer support!Pros:sounds goodFits snugBattery lasts 3 hours at the gym.Cons:After 3 months charging light stopped workingAt 4 months battery started to drain when not connected to charger.Now at 6 months it still sounds great but randomly will try to call the last number dialed while I'm working out.Honestly, I love the feel and sound of these headphones. I actually chose them over my x2 earbuds.Side note I used these almost every other  day for 4 months. So I have gotten some use out of them. That's why I'm giving them 3 stars.

Updated: GREAT COSTUMER SERVICE. SHOP WITH CONFIDENCE.


These ear buds were amazing. Great sound quality, settings, look, etc.. Then all of a sudden one day the left ear bud stops playing audio. I always keep it in the handy case it comes in and only use them when I watch videos and workout. I'm pretty sad because these are my favorite. I resistered for the warranty ages ago but don't know how it works.Update: SENSO has some of the best costumer service I have ever dealt with. I emailed them about the problem and they responded within 1-2 hours. At first the representative tried to help me with a possible fix to the issue but after it didn't work they sent me a new pair of headphones free of charge.Also I ended up purchasing a new pair because I stepped on the new ones but I didn't have the 10% off promo code that you get from buying them. I sent a short email to SENSO and the rep responded quickly once again and profided me with the code. AMAZING COSTUMER SERVICE.

Well designed


I have tried other Bluetooth ear buds and did not like them because I could hear swishing noise while I walked.  These are surprisingly comfortable and have really good sound.  I didn't change out anything even though they come with several sets of ear buds.  They are easy to operate, stay comfortably in my ear but not too snug.  I have another pair of custom fit noise canceling earphones by Sensaphonics which are wonderful but they really do isolate out other noise and you can't still carry on any conversation if necessary.  I like these reasonably priced ear buds because they cancel most of the outer noise but not all of it.  Very pleasantly surprised.  The only complaint I have is that the marking for left or right ear is almost impossible to see even with a magnifying glass.

Extraordinary Sound, Functionality, Reliability, and Exceptional Value


Purchased these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones on a tremendously discounted flash sale and frankly wondered whether this price cut was due to excess inventory, inferior quality, or some form of product recall. To the contrary, these SENSO headphones are among the best of five different brands that two of my family members (one a nationally renowned fitness athlete and Krav Maga instructor, the other a female triathlete and physician who needs serenity when transcribing medical records) and myself have worn in rugged environments and almost daily use during the past two year. The other products included good-to-top-of-the-line offerings from Bluephonics, TaoTronics, Phaiser, and another manufacturer. Only the superior sound, better battery life, and overall quality of Tsumbay's product (Wireless Headphone Active Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones, Sports Sweatproof Earphone with Mic APT-X HiFi Stereo Sound 8 Hours Battery Life for Cycling Jogging Gym) was in the same league. Albeit at a much higher price point. The SENSO pairs easily, is comfortable and almost too secure with rapid movements and gyrations. It appears immune to heavy sweating and light rainfall (I would not test this or any water resistant/waterproof headset in the shower or a torrential downpour, but imagine it might just keep on playing.) Several of the other headphones mentioned either crapped out after 30-60 days of use or did not stay in position when transitioning from running-to-biking-to-rowing type environments. The packaging and charging accessories SENSO features are terrific. Beyond anything else, however, the 24/7 LIVE Support provided was phenomenal. I had a question about the capability of connecting two devices at once (iPhone, iPad in my case) and Customer Service picked up on the first ring--on a weekend, no less. The rep (Nideen?) was professional, knowledgeable and courteous. And responded without hesitation to my question and a potential work around. The one year, hassle free warranty is also a plus. One note about the box of goodies and accessory chargers. The short charging cable accommodates the iPhone 7/7+, whereas the 3 Foot elegant charging cable facilitates all other charging connection hardware (iPhone/iOS, Android, MP3, etc.).

Great for the price


Sound quality is good. Much better than what I expected for $35. Pairing happened right away. Not sure the range but i keep my phone in my pocket or hand and they never cut out. They come with multiple ear adapter piece things(not sure what the term is :p). I had issues while jogging with them at first as they would fall out constantly. They come with a red ear plug feeling adapter that worked great for running once I used those. 6 miles and they didn't even budge. Those ones cancel outside noise really well so make sure to pay attention to your surroundings with those in. Headphones didn't feel uncomfortable at all after wearing them for a couple hours straight. The headphones themselves have a volume control as well as taking your devices set volume into account so they can get ridiculously loud. Definitely would recommend as a nice budget headphone.

**Update as of August 2018**These are still going strong, good battery life and zero issues, other simular looking ones I've bought for cheaper have worse sound (static, delays) and just flat out die. These are still amazing.**Original Review**For the price, these headphones are amazing. I love them, and have used them for 5 months as of this review with zero issues. Are they the pinnacle of sound, no, but they get the job done.The packaging of the headphones is amazing at this price point. They look good, and I've been averaging 7-9 hours use between charges.

Get 'em, You'll be Glad


These were a gift from my girlfriend. Love these earphones, I've had them for about 6 months now and my girlfriend is jealous she spent all that money on her Beats. The sound quality is excellent, I wear them pretty much everyday when working in the wood shop, my work warehouse, or out in the yard with the mower and blower and the noise canceling is superb. The ONLY issue I have is that sometimes they initially have trouble connecting to my devices and I have to wait for them to pair correctly with my phone or ipad. But even after all this time they still last around 6-8 hours on a full charge and only take about 45 minutes to an hour to charge. Then my girlfriend lost her pair of Beats so I bought her a pair of these. We now both have a pair.Update: Been quite a while now and the headphones were still working great but my dog chewed them up.. so I just ordered myself another pair👍🏼 Hopefully these are the same quality as the last two pair I received.

Good audio but the main control button is poorly designed


These earbuds have pretty good sound quality. I'm not going to complain about that. What I do take issue with is the design of the controls. There are volume +/- buttons and one multi-function button. The multi-function button only responds to how long you press it for. A quick press is play/pause, a two second press is skip, and longer than that turns it off. The only other function on it is re-dial. I don't know why, but I guess that's an important one. The multi-function button is positioned directly over your ear canal so any attempt to mess with it drives the device deeper into your ear, which, for me at least, ranges from unpleasant to painful. I've also never had the skip song function actually work. It beeps like it did something but then nothing happens.While this is a good headset for listening to music, it's a very poor remote-control. Considering the impressive range of control offered by a single button on other earbud options, I'm very disappointed with what's offered here.

Not what they used to be


I had a pair of these I used for the past two years teaching online video classes and they worked really well.  When my old pair no longer held a charge, I decided to purchase a new pair.  Well, these are nothing like they used to be.  I could tell immediately that the headset is much lighter in weight and feels cheap.  I used this new pair today for the first time and had to stop using them.  My students could not hear me at all, and I just heard a bunch of static in my ears. Too bad.

Decent bang for the buck


I went through several more expensive pairs of headphones before I landed on these.  I run in Seattle, which means lots of rainy runs.  Previous headphones died on me within a few months of exposure.  These have made it nearly a year now, and are going strong.From the price, you should know these are not high end headphones.  Audio quality is fairly middling.  And at least with my ears, there’s substantial wind noise, thanks to the air gap where they wrap around my ears in front.  Battery life is excellent.  So good, that I’ll forget about charging them, only for them to die mid-run.  There is a warning that goes off, but it gives about 10 more minutes of usage.  So if it goes off, odds are it’ll go dead before the end of the workout.Still, I’m very happy with the durability.  The fact that they’re still working outweighs any sound quality concerns.

UPDATE TO UPDATE:  The company has sent me a replacement set, and I am a satisfied customer.  They were really easy to work with in getting the below issue resolvedUPDATE TO Below review: I have since been contacted by the factory, and they are working with me to resolve the issue.  I will update with the progress.  If they resolve the issue I will be moving stars up to 5, as for the price of these, they performed as expected - when they worked.Received this 4 months ago.  Great product presentation and accessories.  Paired easily with my Verizon kyocera smart phone.  Great sound quality for the price.  Earbud straps a little flimsy, but the buds generally remained in place during workouts and bike rides - fit better after changing out to the correct sized, included buds.  After sweating for awhile they did start falling out a bit more easily, but still not a major issue.  The range of these is short - within 3 feet of the phone works best.On June 5, the units stopped working.  They will not turn on at all.  The charging light comes on to show fully charged.  I have tried different chargers.  The units will not come on.  I have emailed the company and will update once I hear back regarding how or if they will handle my warranty.  Overall, I was pleased with these while they worked, but keep in mind, I am not a huge tech guy.  So, I am not very critical on electronic reviews.

Favorite function: flexible ear piece


These work great! They come with the typical three different size ear pieces. They also came with some thicker Red, cushioned, foam-like ear piece, so a 4th set. The instruction don't mention them, but all I can gather is that they are noise canceling? Haven't tried them yet. They pair easily. I love the buttons. They are not tricky like other pairs I have had. They come with a charger for your car and for the house. These are really great quality! The cords for charging are even reinforced in the areas that these type of cords tend to break and fray. Ok, my favorite part....drum roll...the part that wraps around your ears. I have these little ears.  These type of head phones normally fall right off. But, this pair, that ear piece is bendable. I can mold it to actually fit my ear. What a relief!

Bluetooth Stutters


The headphones themselves are nice enough. The sound is good. But, they really aren't comfortable in my ears. They hurt after a while. But, the real deal killer is that these headphones stutter badly when connected to an Android device. Every fifteen seconds, they stutter for a few seconds. I've read that this is common for some Bluetooth headphones and Android devices and seems to be related to what version of Bluetooth is being used.I am using Android 7.0 and I have no stuttering problems with my old over-the-head Motorola Bluetooth headphones. But, these Senso ear buds and another Bluetooth headset I bought last year stutter badly. Whatever new version of Bluetooth they are using does not work with my Android. The Senso ear buds work fine with my laptop and other music devices I have. Just not my phone, which is why I bought them.My advice to Android users is to look for reviews that mention this stuttering problem.

Fantastic deal, fantastic headphones


I shop Amazon basically all of the time, but I don't believe I've ever taken the time to write a review before.  I will take the time now, because I spent hours reading wireless headphone reviews, looking for user opinions and judgments, before I finally just caved and bought the most popular pair.So, what did I think of these headphones?  I love them.  First things first - I'm not an audiophile.  If you are, you probably won't be all that impressed.  But then again, if you are buying 40$ wireless headphones for the music quality, you might want to re-assess your goals.That said, the sound quality is excellent for the price.  I run about 30 miles a week, including a 15-mile Saturday run.  There were a lot of comments about the noise from the wind, and while it IS noticeable, it doesn't overpower the sound or anything.  These are not truly noise-cancelling headphones, which was alright for me, as someone who runs alongside highways and roads.  What matters is that, while I can hear just enough to know when traffic is coming, the music is always loud and clear.The earpieces took a couple of experiments to get right, but once I got the right setup, both ears stay perfectly in place for hours of sweaty running.  The sound is almost TOO loud at first, but is easily adjustable through the earpiece while running.  The cord occasionally sticks to my sweaty neck, but it's a minor annoyance at worse.And now the two best parts of these headphones, in my opinion.  First is battery life - as someone who runs for multiple hours, this is VERY important to me.  I was able to get about 8 hours of use out of the first charge.  I haven't attempted running it down that far since.  I charge them once a week for an hour, and they are never extinguished.  Second is pairing.  These pair automatically, and hold the pair as I move throughout my house, often 30 feet and 3 walls away.  The two conditions I was most concerned with in looking for wireless headphones was battery time, and pairing/signal strength.  I was wary of bold claims in both of these areas, but these headphones absolutely deliver up to promised functionality, and beyond.Final prognosis - if you can't spend 40$ on these headphones, you need to get out of the wireless headphone market.  The cost-to-value ratio on these bad boys is amazing, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a budget-friendly solution.I have never been paid or otherwise compensated for any kind of review on any site.  I am not a guy who typically reviews items after purchasing them.  There are only two Jeremy Hurtt's alive, and I'm the Arkansas one.  This review is 100% my own views, created 100% out of my genuine motivation to recommend these headphones.

Great Product!


Got this SENSO Bluetooth Wireless Headphones in 2 days, came with a nice round hard case.  According to the enclosed paper, I notice that everything is in the box except one item for putting the wire away?  But it is ok cos the important items are there.  Firstly it is so comfortable to wear them.  Secondly, I paired it with my Samsung S7 Active, the sound is very good, according to my friend who knows his sound.  The announcement ""Connection is on"" and ""Connection is off"" are very clear and in proper English (lol) that I understand.  When you get a call while listening to music, there is sound of charms and announcement of the phone number.  This is a great product at a reasonable price.  I sincerely hope it will last.  I have a question: ""how can you tell when the charge is so low that I need to charge it?""  Do I have to wait until there is no sound?  Can SENSO give me an answer?

Awesome headphones, awesome price!


I have had these headphones for about a week and worn them several times. They are super comfortable and have really great sound. For the price, they are a steal. I bought a pair made by TaoTronics a few weeks earlier thinking they would fit me well, but they didn't work out like I thought they would and the battery life was only about 4 hours. The Senso has a much longer battery life, they fit comfortably while I am working out or running on the treadmill, and they come with a nice case, extra charging cord and one for the car. Cool extras! Also, I like where the controls are. On the other brand they were on the cord and with the extra weight the cord kept moving to that side while I was running and I kept trying to straighten it out. With the Senso, it is on the right ear piece and they have a little thing to slide on the cord so you can tighten it up in the back and it doesn't move around while running. Bottom line... these are a terrific price, they have awesome sound and base, they fit and I don't think you can go wrong with them.

READ THIS REVIEW


I've had these for six weeks,  so far they are performing great, with an over 8 hour battery life, and good sound quality, I'm actually thinking about purchasing another pair. UPDATE : 11-3.2017: Original set failed after about 5 and a half months of regular and possibly sometimes extensive use. I contacted Senso , and they replaced them within a week. They have made improvements to the earpiece and the charging port since I ordered my first set. They basically fixed everything I had an issue with. As far as the headset failing after 5 months, if they're willing to replace it, and it lasts a year, ITS WELL WORTH 36 DOLLARS !!!...YES, I paid 36 BUCKS!!!, and back then they only had 9,000 reviews, I just received today a brand new pair but apparently they're only 20 bucks now, so I'll be buying a pair for everybody I know for Christmas.

Excellent Wireless Earbuds


An excellent wireless earbud set that worked as advertised. Noise reduction is not as good as my wired noise cancelling earbuds but it comes very close and the hi-fi sound is superior. The battery life is as advertised and rechargeable, but I wish that the charge indicator light was easier to see and examine. Bluetooth connection is very easy and all vocal prompts and verbal confirmations were loud and understandable. The earbuds are so light that you hardly will notice that you are wearing them and the buds fit vert nicely in the ear canal. Overall this is a very good set and I will now buy another for my other devices and discard my other wired earbuds that unfortunately have proven to have a limited life. Recommended.

I went down the beats route...


I've owned multiple pairs of the original wired powerbeats, studios, powerbeats2s thinking that they were the best sound quality at their price point and they all fell apart after a few months. I am a bit hard on my headphones, but I want a pair that can take a bit of abuse, these are outdoor/gym headphones for me. I switched straight to these after my last pair of powerbeat2s became unusable. I was instantly surprised that I preferred th sound quality of the Sensos out of the box.  Senso is at least as good as your average bluetooth headset but far cheaper, a little more emphasis on the lows with the foam tips, which I love. Use the foam tips, they really improve the quality. I wish they lasted longer, or came with more foam tips though.

DEFINATELY GOOD BUY, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE


Glad I purchased these. After fumbling with the apple wired earbuds for the past year while hiking I decided to research a set of BT Wireless buds. These SENSO wireless headphones had many 4 and 5 star reviews. Actually I think they had better reviews than the Major Brands which sell for $150-200. Several reviews talked about Excellent Customer Service as well as great quality. I cannot comment on Bass being good or bad since my only reference is the apple brand wired ear buds which I never felt were of great quality or fit. Not sure what ears apple was trying to fit?  I think the volume and bass in these Senso headphones are great. Sound quality is awesome. Waterproof feature seems great. I have had them for a couple weeks and I hike 5-7 miles a day and definitely give them a good sweat test. No issues. Connecting is a breeze. The ""hooks"" that go above your ears are so comfortable, they're soft and flexible and even with my glasses on, there is no pressure points or areas that are uncomfortable. I never even feel them.  The controls all work great. Funny, the volume up and down seem to be backwards to what I naturally would expect, but in a day was used to the setup.  I have Nike+ Apple Watch and have read it works great with it as well, but have not had the opportunity to try them connected directly to the watch since my hikes have elevation gains I want to track and the watch does not track elevation so I pair with the phone, start my music and launch NRC on the phone. The microphone works great, I have had several calls come in during a hike and have never had any connection issues, static or anything else. I have asked the first few people who called if it sounded ok and they all said perfect.  The customer service is amazing. I got an immediate response to an inquiry and two follow ups on the issue as well as follow ups from the ceo regarding the purchase and my satisfaction.  I RECOMMEND THESE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I would repurchase these in the future should I need another set.  Customer Service also offered, free of charge to send spare cushions for the ear bud part. Although I have not yet received them, I have no reason to believe they are not going to show up. Very satisfied and very cost effective solution for me.

Easy to use, lots of sound cutting out.


In terms of general use, these get the job done. The battery lasts long, they don't take long to charge, they're comfortable to wear, pair with my phone easily, and have a good sound quality.However, After owning them for only a few months, it has some severe issues with connectivity. Sometimes if I move my head too fast or sometimes when I'm walking, the sound starts cutting out like crazy. This used to be infrequent, but now it's almost a daily occurrence that has me back in the market for more reliable headphones. The sound has been cutting out even when I'm just standing at my desk, and it drives me crazy.I suppose you could do worse for what you pay for, but I was hoping for more longevity.

Been using them occasionally for months and...


...they sound great for my purposes.  They fit well and I can jog, train martial arts, really jump around.  They don't come loose.  Cord is not an inconvenience.  These are a great set of headphones for the price.Only con I have is that the bluetooth range feels more like ten feet before it starts to break up.  30' might be the absolute max range at which you can get a weak signal.  Playing music from my Samsung phone I get about 10'.  That's good enough for most of my purposes.

Review: 1 year of Ownership, still great product!


I am writing this review a little later as I have owned the Senso wireless headphones for over a year and just recently purchased a pair of Beats Wireless Headphones.  At the price, you can not beat these Senso headphones.  In fact, there are only 3 noticeable areas where Beats are slightly better:1. The quality of the plastic that fits around the ear.  Only wish, it was stronger on the Senso2. The quality of the sound and volume. I found Beats, for all their hype, are only slightly better3. The ability to skip to the next song without using my device. Senso doesn't have it, Beats doesI bought my Beats for $99 on Black Friday deal which is a decent savings (normally $199). I will say that at $27 for the Senso vs. the normal price of $199 for Beats ... SENSO wins that price comparison hands down.If you want a pair of good under $30 wireless headphones.  Buy the SENSO!  100% recommend.

Best for the price


Overall, fantastic buy. Cannot go wrong with these headphones if you're on a budget and need some solid bluetooth wireless headphones.Positives: Excellent sound quality, not absolutely mind blowing but very high definition sound and very reasonable bass as well. Reasonable battery life and very reasonable charging time. Volume goes extra loud, loud enough to damage hearing. Very sweat/dust resistant for the most part. Have been using these for 1 year, working out 4-6 times a week and they are in perfect shape.Negatives: Sometimes bluetooth connection can be a little frustrating, if you connect to one device and then would like to connect to another device at a later point, you need to fiddle with it and turn it on and off a few times before it works. Low battery indicator is my only major complaint about these headphones -- specifically, it warns you of low battery when you only have roughly 5 or so minutes of listening time left. Low battery indicator should have been set to warn you when you have at least 20 minutes left so you can still use them for the remainder of a workout. Numerous times I found myself halfway into my workout with a battery low reminder and my headphones cut out at the end of the song.Overall, solid 4/5 rating. For the $30 I dropped on these, they have exceeded my expectations far and beyond, and I would recommend them to anyone without a doubt.

Sound Good. Feel Good. Bluetooth Fails When Your Device is on Your Left Arm.


For running, these are working great for me. They don't come loose, and sound clarity is more than enough for that context.The problem has to do with it's bluetooth capability. When I strap my phone to my left arm during a run (easy to do with my right hand, and it makes the arm band's key pocket easy to access), sound cuts in and out frequently during a run. The receiver is in the right ear bud, which means the signal might be struggling to pass through my head or something. I don't know. I'm not a physicist.What I do know is that moving my phone to my right arm, right below the receiving ear bud, solves the problem. Ear buds work just fine, then. The problem, then, becomes that feeling weird and accessing the key pocket (now on the back of my shoulder) becoming an awkward ordeal.

Could have a better connection


Good: Feels good on my ears. Sound doesn't give me a headache. Fast charging.Bad: Connection could be better. It was only completely stable when my S6 Edge was in my front shirt pocket. It would lose connection in my fanny pack or cargo pants front pocket. Unfortunately, I forgot my phone was in my shirt pocket and bent over to pick up something and watched my phone cracking it's screen on my driveway. So there is risk in trying to maintain a good connection. If you like a lot of bass in your ear buds you might want to look elsewhere. The sound is clear and phone calls are easy to understand on both ends.

Amazing quality sound and bass. I listen to EDM, so bass quality is a must for me.


I think I got very lucky and received a great product. I have been using this for a while. Connected with my Android devices and works wonders, great quality. I used with my iPhone and the bass was too high, but it's due to the iPhone music quality, it's bass it's always boosted. I had to download an app to regulate the bass on my iPhone and it works amazing.Great product, totally worth my money and more.  Also came with it's own extra earbuds, USB cable charger and car USB power adapter. (Does NOT come with wall adapter, it says that) other than that, I definitely recommend it. Of course, I compared the quality to boss headphone and skull Candy headphones audio quality and it's very similar quality to both at a cheaper price.

They would be great if they lasted more than a month


I have never been a fan of bluetooth earphones in general because it just seems like there is more that can potentially go wrong, but I figured I would give these a try just in case. They worked pretty great initially: sound quality was fair for the price, bluetooth was responsive and connected quickly, and the battery was actually as advertised at 7ish hours. My only complaint was that the flap covering the charge port was very difficult to get open, even for somebody with very average sized hands. After a few weeks of use (maybe 3 full charges) it started to not connect to my phone as quickly as it initially did. I'm not factoring this in to the rating because I'm not sure if it was an issue with my phone or the earphones, but it is something I noticed. The major issue is that these completely crapped out mid-workout and wouldn't come back on. I paused it to talk to somebody, then a minute later I hit the unpause button and it didn't resume; in fact there was no beep or any noise that indicated I was even hitting a button. Even after holding down the power button, there was no response. They were freshly charged, so it wasn't that the battery died (the earphones will give you a warning probably about 20 minutes before they're about to die). While tempted to give these 1 star, I acknowledge that I could have just gotten a faulty set, and I actually really liked them when they were functional. But they died about 4 days after the return window closed, so I feel a little bit cheated

Worked at first, but now not so much. *Updated* Replacement shipped.


Update 03/22/18 - Company contacted me with trouble shooting advice and when that failed to solve the problem, they promptly shipped me a brand new pair. I am about to try them and will update, but I felt the excellent customer service exhibited deserved an updated review.For the first month, these worked as advertised. Great for my workouts as I was unhindered by cords. However, after the first month, the music started to “skip” or cut in and out rapidly, like portable CD players do when they are bumped. I recharged the headphones thinking that was the issue, but it only continues to worsen. Impossible to listen to music. Luckily I purchased a warranty, so I will be returning/replacing. I wouldn’t recommend this product.

Great sound for your buck!


I bought these after breaking a few bluetooth headsets. My previous headsets would just suddenly stop returning, probably cause I sweat on them or I'd try to shower in them without knowing its waterproof rating. After my last ones, I've decided I wouldn't buy something really expensive and tried these out. Apparently these used to be expensive but have been marked down when I bought them. I was skeptical, but these really surprised me! At first I didn't like how bass heavy it was, but then I adjusted equalizer settings on my phone and it now sounds better than any of my previous bluetooth headsets hands down! It's so good that I had to take time out of my day to rate these! Good job Senso! Never heard of the company, but awesome product!

Not for running, otherwise good product


My main reason for this purchase was for running. Unfortunately, these particular headphones simply are not designed properly for running. When running (or just outside with a slight breeze there is a rather loud wind sound. It seems that the design of these catches the wind (either blowing or generated while running) in such a way as to generate a lot of noise that is delivered right into your ear. I tried moving these around and there just does not seem to be a way that they can be worn during a run that reduces the noise.Other than that issue they are actually quite good. The sound is crisp and clear (I listen to audio books/podcasts not music). They pair easily and connect quickly. The case is nice to keep them from getting crushed when tossed into a bag. They come with a couple different in-ear pieces. The typical rubber version as well as some that are foam. The foam ones are very nice and seem more comfortable for extended wear than the typical in-ear pieces from other headphones I have worn

Great Audio and Bluetooth Connection


These headphones are very easy to use and are sweatproof as described. The bluetooth connection works for the specified distance then starts going in and out when I'm across the gym from my phone, impressive range. I recently purchased a Garmin Forerunner 645 music and many people report having trouble maintaining a connection with their bluetooth headphones while swinging their arm away from the headphone because it's too far, these headphones paired and maintain a connection without any issue. Suck it Beats and Airpods.Also, I ordered 2 pairs of headphones but after 10 months of use one of the pairs stopped working and after contacting Senso, they are sending me a replacement pair 2 days later. Even if they didn't send a new pair I would still say these headphones were worth it.

Worked OK  for about a month


This is the 3rd time I bought this wireless headset.  First ones lasted about a year.  2nd set I lost.  This last set work for about a month, then all of a sudden none of the buttons work, it would lower the volume without me touching it, and would skip head constantly when listening to audible. I could no longer use it to talk on the phone either.  Also I do not like the adjustable part that goes around your ear.  Its like a pliable gumby.  Always having to adjust them to fit, and they don't stay on as well.  After awhile they are just too pliable to hold it's shape.  Very disappointing this time around.  Guess it's time to try another brand.

Very high quality and durable, accidently machine washed and dried and they still worked!


This is the second set I have purchased. I am on airplanes a lot and I use these to listen to music, watch movies and sometimes just to shut off the world so I can relax. These are awesome sounding bluetooth headsets. I get about 6 hours continuous usage between charging. I really did not understand how good these really were until I accidentally left them in a pocket, while machine washing and machine drying my pants, and they still worked afterwards! They have included a nice unexpected bonus in each purchase. My first set included a car power adapter. The latest set included a high quality car vent magnetic phone holder. I paid around $40 for my first set on a lightning deal which was about half off. This latest set was $21.95 list price so the decision was easy.

I wish I could give it 5 stars.


These headphones are great for the price and come with a lot of accessories. I purchased these to use with my iPhone and Apple watching while outside doing yard work. The headphones charged up quick and connected to both devices easy. However when I got outside I had a lot of issues. My phone was less than 5 ft away from me and my watch was on my wrist. The headphones kept cutting out unless I stuck the watch right by the headphones. I then disconnected it from my watch and had to carry my phone around in my pocket which kind of defeated the purpose of why I got them. When connected to my phone they worked great and I didn’t lose power while using them for about 6 hours. They just didn’t seem to stay connected to my watch very well.

These really are the BEST for several reasons


When I did an online search for ""best blue tooth headphones"" these came up first.  For good reasons! 1.) SUPER price. 2.) Great sound! 3.) Great product.  I'll elaborate on the latter: They're easy to use, they have just 3 buttons and a brief manual that explains the volume control/advance play buttons, and the main button's use for on/off/pause, incoming calls, etc.  They are comfortable with 3 earbud size options.  My ears are too small for the flexible over-the-ear clips, but they aren't in the way or bothersome.  I live in the snowy north, so for outside activity the clips actually fit snugly beneath my hat. Nice storage carrier to throw in a gym bag, pocket, or carry-on.I haven't taken a call with these so I can't comment on how that goes.Bought these for my daughter too - she also loves them.

Didn't work with my AppleWatch


I don't understand how these can be the #1 best selling and have such positive reviews.  Despite reading many reviews saying that while using these with the AppleWatch and walking/running they would cutout and lose connection, I bought them anyway.  Sure enough, on my first run they cut out every time my left wrist would move back and forth.  Now I know I need to lose some weight, but I can't believe that my body is so large and dense that it should block a signal from my left wrist to right ear!The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that they were comfortable to wear and they stayed in place while I ran.

The rubber insulation is pretty good. When they came out of the dryer ...


I use these for bike rides and work. When there is a lot of wind the signal can come and go but nothing serious.They went thru the washer and dryer and came out unscathed. That earned them a 5 Star. I have had them for 4 months and still work.The rubber insulation is pretty good. When they came out of the dryer they were missing the side piece. The water didn’t get in because they are covered inside as well with like a melted rubber cover. All the junctions are covered inside.The sound quality is good. The connection is sometimes sketchy  but nothing serious. I use an iPhone 8plus and I have issues with other electronics as well. So it could be either. Over all a great product that I will be buying another.

Best bang for the buck!


First, let me say that I never make a purchase without first doing some research.  Amazon has so many different brands of headphones available, but I decided to try the SENSO based on written product reviews, product review videos on YouTube, and finally price.  I ordered these specifically for use at work where I work in ""cube land"" and it's difficult to drown out background noise.  The day these arrived at my office, I opened the package and had these powered on and connected with my iphone in a matter of seconds.  Super easy to set up.  Now, I have found since a few days of use, that I need to fuss with them a little more when switching devices (iphone, ipod and Samsung Galaxy S3), but nothing that would make me want to pull my hair out.Comfort:  These are so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them at times.  I like the soft, flexible loops that goes over my ears.  I wear glasses and don't have any issues or discomfort from the combo of these with my glasses.  I also like having the option of ear piece sizes.  I haven't tried running or working out with these yet, so can't say how these feel/fit when being very active.Sound:  I will admit that I am not the biggest sound snob.  I know that I do not like distorted bass or vocals in a song when the volume is turned up.  The sound from these headphones is clear with a good mix of bass and treble.  The biggest feature I want to talk on is the noise cancelling capability of these headphones.  I have found myself forgetting that I am in an office full of people as all background noise is gone.  I have actually had a few people standing in my cube talking to me without me even knowing it.  It's not until they tap me on the shoulder that I know they are trying to talk to me.So far, after a few days with these headphones, I have no real complaints.  If you are on the fence about what brand to buy, then buy these.  I don't think you will be disappointed!

Wow.....


Beats who?!? These headphones can definitely be placed on the same level with a pair of Beats headphones, without the price. They are EXACTLY what I was looking for. They are indeed loud, I haven't even turned them up half way, and that says a lot because I like my music very loud. The bass quality is very good, I feel every beat perfectly. Clarity in every conversation. Great battery life, I get a full day and a half on one charge. The only thing I can think of that I don't like is the ""Low Battery"" alert in the headphones, it tells you ""Low Battery "" multiple times before turning off. I do not like that, but other than that these are my favorite headphones by far.

Another disappointment for bluetooth headphones


Buying Headphones on Amazon might be one of the most difficult things due to some of the questionable reviews. I have bought several ""budget"" Bluetooth headphones on Amazon, and they continue to be a disappointment. My problem with this Senso Bluetooth Headphones was its quality of sound. I listen to a lot of podcasts at the gym and my ears literally started hurting from the sound quality. There is a lot of bass and echo that makes it hard to hear. I had to take these off because I just couldn't stand the sound anymore.Another thing is that the mic barely works. So don't expect to use the mic because the person you are talking to will not hear you very wellI think the only thing I can do now is to move up the $ ladder and buy a more quality headphones.

Great sound, design, and customer service


These headphones are second to none in quality for your money and customer service. I had a pair for about 5 months that worked well, synced fast, and played music clearly. Loved it. Then for some reason the charging port stopped working and my battery eventually died because I could not recharge the battery. I was perfectly fine with buying a new set because of the cheap price before I realized that I was still covered under the one year SENSO warranty. I emailed customer support and told them about my issue. They replied to my email immediately with troubleshooting tips and when that didn't work, they immediately sent me a new set of headphones. I've already recommended them to people in the past and I plan on doing so in the future. Great pair of bluetooth headphones.

in the short time I've used them I really like them. Here's why


I just received these two days ago so I haven't used them too much.  But, I did pair them up right away and had no problem.  Also, in the short time I've used them I really like them.  Here's why:1.  They fit well.  Sometimes earbuds don't fit well or feel right.  When I put these in and wrap the things around my ear they feel secure.  They come with small, medium and large ear fittings to fit your ear.2.  I like the controls on the earbuds.  They have a button to turn them on and off - which also is used to pair up the earbuds and to answer the phone if it rings.  Also has two buttons to adjust volume if you need to.3.  They sound really good.  I've had earbuds before that just sound awful - but these have good highs and lows and sound great with my music.I've only had them two days so not a lot of use yet but from what I've seen so far I'm impressed.

It works but needs improvements


These headphones are easy to pair and have pretty decent sound.  However, I have a few issues with them.1. I have to constantly reconnect them to my phone. For some reason the connection drops even when I'm standing next to my phone.2. The range is subpar3. It doesn't automatically connect.  If my phone is connected to my car's bluetooth and I step out- this headphone would not auto reconnect.  As a matter of fact, it doesn't respond when I try to manually connect it myself either.  I have to turn it off and back on for it to pick up....annoying4.  It needs weights.... Like seriously. If you only use one earbud, the thing is hanging all down your back.  I don't have that issue with my Beats.Did I say the range sucks?

Preferred old version bc new version sticks to hair


I loved these earbuds. For the price, they could not be beat. Sound quality was amazing. They were durable. The battery life was still reliable after a year and a half... and then I lost them.I bought the newer version (s255) and the sound quality is comparable. However, I learned that the old s250's did not have adjustable ear hooks, and that made them better than the s255.I came back to the s250 to order what I thought would be a pair just like I bought in 2017. Unfortunately, the new s250 are adjustable and have a different grippier plastic on the ear hooks that gets tangled in my hair 100% of the time I try to use them.People without long hair will most likely see the adjustability and grippiness to be a benefit. For me, it's always a struggle.

I really like these but here I am 5 months with them and they are shorting out on me ...the left bud is hit and miss...that really sucks as I thought they were going to be a good buy for me but 5 months is not gonna qualify them as a good buy in my books and actually quite the opposite as represented with my 1 star rating...  **UPDATE**I called the company and the service they provide is TOP NOTCH they really stand by their products... they more than made up what may been lacking in the product itself so combining that I cant see how they would not deserve the highest marks..their customer service is just that good..

Good Value but connectivity issues


I really enjoy this product and would recommend it. My issue is shortly after buying, the sound would cut out. Almost like the wire shorts when you move it a certain direction. I probably should have exchanged it but it wasn't a big deal. Now that I've had it for so long, it's getting worse. The sound quality has been good and better than other wireless headsets I've tried. Plus, I really like having audio controls on the headset. This way you can easily adjust the volume, answer a call, and switch songs all while you're phone can remain in your pocket or wherever you keep it while running.

Just tried them today and the sound is very good.  Works well with my Apple One=Touch.These headphones paired easily with my Apple One-Touch 6th generation IPOD. The sound quality is very good … in my opinion. This unit enables you to adjust the volume. It is tiny control switch on one of the right ear piece.I like the feature that when you press a red button the side of right ear piece, you will hear, ""Power on"" and press it again and you will hear, 'Power off.""  The right ear piece on has an indicator light when the unit is on and will indicate when charging the battery if it is fully charged or is still charging.  I am impressed by the sound quality.

Sound Keeps Cutting In and Out


I just took these wireless Bluetooth headphones on their maiden voyage. The good news is they are very light weight, have three sizes of eartips (medium comes on them and fit just fine), and when they work, they work very well and are easy to charge and set up. The bad news is that they do not work consistently at ALL. Maybe I just have a bad pair? I am walking along, listening to Pandora from my phone with these, and the sound kept cutting out--on, off, on, off. It was very annoying. I will give them another try tomorrow when there's no construction going on in my neighborhood (although I doubt the machines were interfering), but I'll probably be returning these as defective.

Great headphones for the price.


I bought these to replace a much more expensive set that died after 3 years of almost daily use... In the few days I waited for these to arrive, I borrowed my wife's mid-price set of wireless headphones and they were terrible... no bass, poor fit...I was glad when my SENSO headphones arrived but frankly, I didn't have very high expectations for these as they are $125 less expensive than my last pair... after a week of daily use, I am very impressed by the sound quality.  They charge quickly and are quite comfortable to wear. The controls are backwards from what I am used to... the ""back button"" increases volume and advances tracks... the ""front button"" lowers the volume and goes back a track. They paired quickly with my Galaxy S7 and continue to connect quickly when turned on. Don't let the low price scare you off.... you won't be disappointed with these.

Amazing product for the price!


Given what I was looking for, this product deserves 5 stars.  I wasn't looking for top-of-the-line sound or the newest hip name brand product.  I wanted a pair of cordless earbuds I could workout in.  The sound is good.  If you're used to listening to $100+ headphones, you'll notice the difference. That being said, they're the only headphones I use now so I've adjusted and have no complaints.  The sweat proof feature was a perk I hadn't even thought of considering but I'm glad they are. The price is good compared to competitor products.They have the loop around the ear, but with how they fit they're basically there for show.  It doesn't really touch my ear.  Having said that, when the bud pops out of my ear I don't have to worry about it falling and getting damaged.Overall -- would recommend

Great quality at this price point


These wireless Bluetooth headphones are an incredible value and exceeded what I was expecting at this price point. The headphones are well made and designed and the instructions and packaging are helpful and exceeding what many companies provide. They paired easily and quickly with my Samsung S7. I bought them specifically for wearing while mowing my lawn and they passed with flying colors. The only negative comment I would make is the sound is a bit tinny when playing music, but I have not tried them yet with a podcast. Even with that, I would highly recommend this product. These headphones have eliminated the hassle of running a cord to my phone that is necessary with my prior headphones that constantly would get tangled up with the lawnmower, bushes, etc.

Bang for your buck!


I've never owned any other pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I have no comparisons. However, I've used them for about 2 weeks, and I am very pleased with their performance.Their battery life is awesome! I usually stay at the gym for an hour and the earbuds are light weight, they do not hurt. I've only had to charge them once since first starting them up. The charging didn't take long either. The phamphlet says not to charge them over night. They charged in less than 2 hours. I also loved the fact that they came fully charged. They also tell you when you have low battery life. Once you hear that warning a minute or two later they completely shut off.They have LED color indicators to tell you when it's pairing, connected/not connected, fully charged, charging or low battery.Connecting to Bluetooth is easy and when I connect the lady tells me I'm connected. It gives me assurance that all is right hahaThe sound quality is great-it can't handle too much bass. But they're earbuds, not speakers.They are comfortable, and do not hurt my ears. They fit my ears and love the fact you sorta turn them to fit them in and they stay secured onto my ear. I have not tried running with these, but they stay on and I don't have to keep adjusting them to find my perfect fit.I have not answered calls with them. I ordered them to listen to music when I workout, not talk or conduct business.The bonus are all the accessories that came with them. A carrying case, short charging cable, car charger, extra ear tips, 3 ft charging cable and a wire tie.Overall, this was the best ~$37 I've spent. I hope they last...

Great! Works like new after 6 months of usage in all conditions.


Review after approx. 6 months ownership:Pro- Battery lasts ~5 hours- No problems after running for 2 hours in full rain- Audio quality is fair enough for sport acitivity- They are not noise blocking / cancelling. When listening to audio books you can still hear shouts / bells of overtaking bikes.- Can be charged with many USB cables (had issues in the past on smaller devices, where USB cables with a bit more plastic wouldn't fit)Con- There seems to be a distance where connection issues are more likely. E.g. when I place my phone in the pocket of a light jacket, I get frequent interruptions. However, no problem if it's buried deep in a large backpack.Overall: worth every penny.

Great budget earbuds for the gym


These are a great set of budget earbuds. I can't bring myself to spend too much on an item that I am going to drench in sweat and just throw in my gym bag, but these exceeded expectations. The packaging is great, and they come with a 2 output car charger, a universal usb charging cable, and a carrying case. I have bought several pairs of skullcandy wireless earbuds that never seem to last, but these sound just as good and seem very durable. Can you find earbuds that sound better? Yes, but be prepared to spend an additional 100 dollars for only a marginal increase in sound quality. The bluetooth pairs quickly and maintains a strong connection. I would recommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive set of earbuds.

They're comfortable enough after trying out all 3 sets of ear ...


These headphones are all right relative to the price. Nothing special & have some quirks.They're comfortable enough after trying out all 3 sets of ear tips. I settled on the medium sized ones. Not a fan of in-ear phones but these don't seem to take up too much space or hurt the area around my ear hole like others I've tried. I can't get earbuds to stay in my ear, so the hooks are a nice feature to keep the tips secured in my ear.I don't care too much about sound quality and these are fine. The controls are in the right ear piece and I have to wear my iphone 5c in an armband on the right side otherwise the music cuts out every time I stride. Sometimes it cuts out if a make a sudden move with my right arm.It's tough to control the volume or skips songs while running. Also when opening the port on the ear piece to insert the charging cord is extremely difficult and I worry it may break off if I use too much force.I only run 2-3 times a week. So might keep using these. Might just relegate them to beach and things that don't require a lot of movement.To reiterate, an OK product for the price.

So great, I keep buying them


I bought my first pair in summer 2017 and used them mostly for running and workouts. I bought my second pair in fall of 2017 so that I would have a set at the camper. These have held up through workouts, running, lawnmowing, etc. I really like the over the ear style, as most ear buds fall out of my ears. I just put in an order for my third pair, as I somehow cracked the plastic on one set. Pretty good for headphones that cost less than $30, as they lasted 3 1/2 years!

Did not pan out for me.


I use these with my Iphone 5 while running and cutting grass. They sound great and I like the rubber wheel that keeps the cord from flopping while running. I have 2 issues:1. The bluetooth connection drops out if I have the phone in my pocket. I have tried a waist belt to carry my phone and this works OK unless I turn my head or have my shirt over the belt carrier. I tried the fix the company posted on another reviewer's complaint several times and it still drops out. I have owned bluetooth headphones that did not drop out under the same conditions.2. The down volume controller on the headphone broke, so I have to use the phone to control volume and change songs.I am now looking for a new set of headphones.

More of a burden to use than anything. Don't buy them.


Do not buy these headphones if you plan on using them to have phone conversations. They are somewhat comfortable when you have them both in, but they are awful when it's just 1 for talking to people on the phone or for use in your car.They are heavy and will pull on the one in your ear. They also don't hang around your neck well. Almost lost them a couple times. The ""C"" that goes around your ear has a thin wire inside that let's you form it to your ears. It catches on everything. Can't put these anywhere without them catching on something and getting all bent up.Save yourself the money and don't buy these unless you're just going to run with them and that's it.On another note, these are Beats knockoffs in case you didn't know. Almost the same exact design and color.

Super cheap and they work


Super cheap and they work. I had a pair of $100 bluetooth headphones that died, got this as a replacement. They sound good (all though not amazing), they're light and the battery lasts a long time. At this cheap price I don't feel bad if they get lost or break. The product that came with extra's I didn't use, a wallet that sticks to the back of a phone and a magnet disk and magnet car AC phone holder. I wanted something to listen to music while I jog and sit in a hot tub, this works. I'm also using it as a wireless ""quiet"" speaker for watching movies from my projector when I don't want to use my surround sound system. Again not amazing quality , sounds like your basic cheap headphone, but it sounds good enough. I'll buy it again if I lose it or it gets broken from something.

QPR quality to price ratio untouchable


I have a 2 to 3 hour commute to and from work every day. I walk to a commuter train station, board a train to NYC, then take a subway. I listen to podcasts and music while trapped in these cans of people.  These headphones are amazing. I would routinely go through 3 to 4 wired headphones a year. The Achilles heel was always the wire failing. These have less wire to tangle and thus less opportunity to bend and break over time. I have had these for 3 months now without any problems. On my iPhone I can even see battery level, which is helpful. There's a learning curve though, you need to shut them off when not using. I do work out at the gym, hike and sweat like a pig anyway. Sweat and rain have had no major problems. Buy them, best money you will spend.

Awesome headphones!


The good: They sound really good and the battery life and charging speed is awesome, you can literally charge em 20 minutes before heading out to the gym and youll be good for the gym session. The ear loop holders are super flexible and mold to your ear really good. I was working the heavy bag for 8 rnds after running 3 miles on the treadmill and they would stay in place!The bad: After using them for about  4 months the left ear bud stopped working all of a sudden, I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that this shoudn't happen because their quality control is second to non. They offered me a refund or a replacement since I am currently stationed in Afghanistan I opted for the refund. I will buy this headphones again with the refund.

Within 2 minutes he responded, “where’s my pair?” And he has high standards. The carrying case and charging cables are wonderful additions. Extra sets of earbuds are fantastic too so. I emailed the company for directions on changing them because I didn’t want to risk damage. The customer rep got back to me in under an hour. Impressive.

Work great with one device. Connecting with multiple devices isn't seamless.


UPDATE: I reset the earphones to their factory settings, and since then they've worked with my phone again. I haven't tried pairing the earphones with my computer or a different device again, but at least I know how to fix the problem of spotty sound if it happens again. Original review below.These worked great when I only had them paired with my phone. No problems with sound; range was good.Then one day I paired them with my laptop. (The headphones specifically say they can be paired with more than one device.) All seemed to be well—until I tried to use them with my phone again. Then the sound started going in and out quickly, a couple of times per second. On my phone I deleted the pairing and re-paired the headphones, and the headphones worked again. Huzzah.However, the next time I tried to use the headphones with my phone, the same thing happened: spotty sound until I deleted/re-paired the headphones. Now I have to re-pair the headphones with my phone *almost every time I use them*. Occasionally the spottiness will go away after about 15 seconds, but that's maybe 10% of the time. It's a huge annoyance and I wish the return window hadn't expired, because I would definitely send these back.

Great sound and comfortable


Amazing headphones. I bought these after pulling my wired set off my ears over and over. They are so easy to set up. I leave my Bluetooth on so when I power these on they immediately connect to my phone. The sound quality is great. I've never bought really expensive headphones so I can't compare these to any other but I definitely enjoy the sound. Also I love that these go around my ears and can be molded to fit tightly on my ears. I can't wear earphones that stay inside the ear. They always fall out and my left is smaller than my right ear hole. With this set I don't have to worry about them falling out. They are also very comfortable.

I am a gym junkie so I go through my headsets quick and purchasing $$$ headphones is not something I look forward to lol. So I did my fair share of research and came across these. I read the specs, the reviews and I was hooked. NOW I SEE WHY. Yo, I am stoked! Can't wait to use them at the gym. Clean, clear sound, no fuzz, bass is just the right amount for me. Wear is comfortable, and material is soft. I am actually wearing them right now listening to Diplo all while getting the goosebumps! Lol I love music so hearing it this clear.. just awesome.

These are pretty well placed


Well finally.  This is my 4th pair of bluetooth over the ear and earbud headphones for use with the treadmill, etc.  At an older age, I need a product that does NOT fall out of my ear and cause me to fall when trying to put it back in.  Most sets, even much more expensive than the Senso ActivBuds, have difficult controls for volume, telephone calls (a feature i do not sure), and advancing the playlist.  These are pretty well placed.  The different sizes of earbuds is a plus as i have discovered I needed smaller ones (do our ears shrink with age?).  They clip over the ear okay and if the bud is in tight, stay on over the ear.  The connections included with this item are also a special feature. Having it for the car will help some.  The battery life a plus  I would give it a 5 if the silicon ear hook somehow loved my ears and stayed close.  I definitely recommend this over many of the products you will see on this website.

Great head set , comfy, lightweight, great sound quality.


What a great head set! I'm really enjoying them. There light weight, easy to use,  wear them for hours! Often forgetting I even have them on when the music is off. They focus the music directly into my ears so much so I feel like the orchestra is in the middle of my head! Never experienced that before with normal head sets! The base is fantastic . The voice quality is  superb. Watching a movie I heard people talking off screen! It was so convincing that I turned around thinking there was someone behind me. I'm very pleased. Battery life is great and the indicator on the phone keeps me informed of how much power I still have. Going on 10 hours now and still 3/4 charge. Great packaging love the extras

Perfect for jogging--they stay in my sweaty ears! Good sound quality, too.


I had a pair of bluetooth earbuds that I got for free with my phone about 3 years ago, and when those started to fall apart, I decided I needed new ones! But my needs were much more specific this time around and these SENSO headphones have been great so far! I am a runner, and I also sweat SO MUCH when I work out. It's difficult to find ear buds that actually stay in my ears because they always slip out when I get sweaty. The buds are very comfy and the ear clip makes them feel extra secure (and I was caught in the rain on my last run, got soaked completely, and they never budged).Another thing I needed was a bit of noise cancellation/superior sound quality without feeling like I was inside my head (the suction on another pair of earbuds I had was almost too much within my ear canal...made me feel a little uneasy and I could hear myself breathing in my head, if that makes sense!).I also sew on a loud sewing machine almost daily, so something that could sort of protect my ears (and sanity) from that noise, while allowing me to listen to podcasts on a reasonable volume while I work was crucial. These have been perfect for that, and no inside-my-head noise! The range seems comparable to my other pair of bluetooth headphones, about 15 - 20 feet.They also work great for talking on the phone with my mom--I can stay mobile and get work done during our marathon daily chats.The only thing I don't like about them is the buttons on the ear bud--adjusting the volume/pausing/turning on and off is a little uncomfortable because I have to press against the ear bud in my ear. I'll usually take the right ear bud out to turn on/off for that reason. If those buttons didn't require such a hard press to activate, I'd like that feature better. I also wish there was a way to indicate battery level. My old earbuds had a prompt when powered on: ""Power on, battery high/medium/low, connected"" which would let me know when I needed to plug 'em in. These just let me know when the battery was about to die.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. For the price, they have proven to be an incredible value so far and I highly recommend them.

Very good ear buds, fast shipping, great support


The see are robust ear buds that settle into your ear comfortably but firmly. They push a rich, mellow bass that is surprisingly good for ear buds this size. Treble seems a bit muffled, but I think that is a result of how I am inserting them into my ears. The ear buds fit snugly and with the over-ear loop they will not pop outOperation of the headphones is mostly centered around a red multifunction button so it is easy to learn what enables Bluetooth to make the buds discoverable, to turn them off and on, to accept phone calls, and to hang up.The higher treble tones aren't as crisp right now as I hope they would be, but I am thinking that it also maybe a fault of the app Imuse and not of these buds. Because of that, they can sound somewhat muffled on various frequency ranges. That said, I am still discovering how to wear these, and it may be how I am wearing them that is causing the problem.Battery charging is short at one to two hours to go to a full charge. Some of my older ear buds took much longer to charge and didn't proved anywhere near the battery life these provide.

DIES FAST.


When i first got this i really liked it. the only problem i had with it is if you answered a call i had to go back to the phone to restart the music player. HOWEVER, since then, play time has shortened considerably. I was able to get 3 trips to the gym, about 6 hours, now it is no more than maybe 3 hours, quits on the second trip, if that long. The other problem, and i am sure related to the short play time, if i dont use it or recharge it for 3 or 4 days, (without use from the last charge) it goes dead in just a few minutes.This is used in the gym only, never been wet or even damp, maybe some sweat, never dropped, always kept in the case sooo. I really wish i had sent it back when i first noticed, now it been too long since purchase in February.

Sound was very good. My reduction in stars comes from fit and connectivity. It did not fit well to my or my wife's ear. It's front edge sits hard to your ear so that after a short time it becomes irritating and also makes it not hold well in the ear. As I would get active I would have to keep pressing it back in no matter which fitting I tried. also the connection to my phone had a lot of drops even with full charge. I saw a helpful review here that said how to reset it which I did and it did help with connection. The problem began to resurface again though.Follow up review I would say that it's not been a very good product. Constant loss of Bluetooth connection is irritating, resetting is not hard just frustrating to have to do all the time. Not for active users, more activity results in faster lost of connection and fit.

Very short range


I don't remember what the advertising blutooth range was for these headphones but unless my phone is in my pocket, they don't work. I would say max distance is 5 feet if there are no walls or windows in between. I am also still struggling  to get them to fit my ears properly. So far, they're more trouble than they're worth but a) they hold a charge for a long time and b) they sound good when they're on, so 2 stars.Update: I use these only when I mow the lawn. It's been a year, I use them once a week when for 3 hours at a time. They have a terrible short circuit happening in the wire, so badly that I can't hear anything if I turn my head to the right. Not a great product.

After a week of use they are a pretty good purchase that I am happy with.


I have used these in a few different settings so far , such as on an outside run, in the house and in the gym. I have pricier name brand wireless headphones with the hanging collar and the other wireless ear buds seem to have a farther range but they are also clunkier and more expensive. SENSO HEADPHONES are great for the price and they do the job. The controls are easy and comfortable to handle without having to take the ear buds out. The weight is nice and the wire behind the head is comfortable. The loops around my ears keep the buds from popping out on the run.Update 2019 : They still work well but I warn you that they may disconnect from your device and you wont be able to use them. Delete them from your device and add them again and that should help them reconnect.

Great call volume. Music and fit not so much for me.


Calls were great using these headphones!  I would work on my car, have the phone in the car and talk on the phone with no issue whatsoever.  Sound quality for music play was a little tinny and the ear pieces never did quite fit right.  Then, after only 2 uses, I lost them. I think my next pair will be the ones that look very similar at half the price ($21.99).  It will be less painful to loose the cheaper set and hopefully the fit and music playback sound is better.  I liked the call quality but mostly what I bought them for was the sound for music while working around the house and such.

Wonderful!


Before even using the earbuds I was impressed with the packaging (it made me think of Apple's packaging), plus all the extras inside.The instructions are well written and easy to understand. I got the ear buds easily synced with my iPhone first and then my iPad.I've never had Bluetooth headphones before, so it was such a treat to be able to answer all around a room and do things not tethered to anything to listen to my audiobook.The quality of sound was wonderful for music. I played the Hallelujah Chorus as the trial piece and the ear pieces passed with flying colors.I next used them for a phone call and it sounded a little muffled. The caller could hear me all right, but said I sounded a little muffled too.These fit comfortably in my ears and I wore them for two hours without a problem. I flipped the connecting cord behind my neck and know one knew I was listening to music.Overall I'm extremely happy with these and plan to buy a pair for my husband.

Failure within 6 months...replacement....failure again within 9 months


When the headphones worked, I enjoyed this product.  But be aware, this is not well made to last an entire year.  Please do yourself a favor an read a few of the reviews.  In my case I bought these headphones in June 2017.  In November 2017 they failed.  Because of the warranty, I was sent a new pair.  Now, in July 2018, the replacement pair have failed.  I used these several times a week for running and meetings.  They truly are in perfect condition in appearance.  But in operation, they either do not turn on properly or they do not connect to my bluetooth device properly.  When I presented this issue to their support team, I was turned away because outside of the one year warranty.  So please note, the warranty is related to the original purchase and NOT the individual product itself.  So, the replacement pair I received in Nov 2017 is not covered for one year but only the remainder of the warranty period based on the original purchase.  I think this says something about the product quality.  Also, I am now 13 months out from my original purchase date and Senso is not willing to flex on an issue where a customer has had TWO failed products.  The addage ""you get what you pay for"" is definitely applied but here perhaps it may be better stated, ""you dont get what you paid for"".I cannot recommend these for someone who wants regular usage and dependability. You would be better served at paying a little more for ones that receive solid reviews from other industry reviewers.  True, this product has 27k+ reviews with about a 4.1 rating (as of the date of this review).  But, I have a hunch that my situation is not a outlier.  The headphones have just enough quality to placate the average customer, but for those that need to have regular usage and dependability, this would NOT be the product for you.Again...  stay away...  buyer beware...

The Ear part is a bendable metal


Not much different than the other BT Headphones in this category. Nothing stands out that an audiophile would care for at this price range bbuuutttt the most innovating thing I've seen is that the ear cradle part can be bent into any way to fit any ear! This is amazinggggggg!The last ones I bought were Mpow Flame & Merdumia BT Headphones & their ear pieces were just a flexible rubber pre-shaped. They would occasionally fall out of the ear when skating or running, but button design is exactly the same. I've now got about 3 sets of ear cover things.4 stars since it doesn't have aptX or LDAC abilities but at this price I don't expect it to.

The sound quality is not as great as other headphones I’ve had but honestly


I’m giving them 5 stars because they’re definitely worth their $30 price. The sound quality is not as great as other headphones I’ve had but honestly, past a certain point I don’t really notice. They do feel a bit cheaply made as far as how light they are and the plastic materials used but it doesn’t bother me. The only thing that does bother me is that the hooks are a little too big for my ears so when I run with them I feel like they’re going to fall out. But I ran 8 1/2 miles with them today and they didn’t fall out. They came with a bunch of little accessories like a little case, a car adapter, and even an iPhone charger(?). Maybe in the future I’ll invest in a more expensive pair of headphones but I feel like these will meet my needs for the foreseeable future

I have had this headphone for more than 3 months now. I have been using it every day. I use it to listen to audiobooks and podcasts. So, I don't really know how well it works for music. But here is my opinion:Pros:* Price* Almost Ok battery lifeCons:* It is very uncomfortable on my ears. There is no option to adjust anything, so if it doesn't fit your ears then you are going to have a bad time.* It is useless when riding a bike (or it is windy outside). The wind noise is unbearable.* The on/off button is on the side and it is not easy to press. So, if you need to turn the headphone on/off it is better to remove it from your ears first, otherwise, you will be pushing the earpiece inside your brain.

Terrible product! No customer service!


Do not buy! Does not work!The headphones will not stay connected to any Bluetooth device—phone, tablet, computer—for longer than 10 seconds, and then it keeps trying to reconnect and then disconnect every 5 - 10 seconds.I reached out to the company by responding to both of their automated post-delivery customer service emails, explaining that the product did not work and they just ignored my emails. So, apparently, they do not actually offer any customer service.Do not buy this product if you ever hope to have a pair of headphones that works, or if you want to actually talk to someone about replacing a dysfunctional product.

This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, so I'll do my best to give an honest review.Pros:- Lightweight- Comfortable- Stay on my earsCons:- Minimal bass- Skip at times even when my phone is literally right next to me (Not sure if this is common with Bluetooth headphones)- Poor quality  - I have had these about 10 months and have had to request a replacement twice now. The first time one of the volume buttons got stuck, so I was unable to either increase or decrease the volume (I can't remember which). Just recently, the power button has become jammed, so I was unable to turn the headphones on. With that being said, both times the company was quick to respond and resolve the issues.

Great Sounding headphones


Great Sounding headphones. They feel fine when wearing and come with a hard case and dual car charger.I wore them all day today working in the yard and They tend to move around and my ears were hurting toward the end of the day. But I ware my headphones all day most days so I feel that I will get used to them. I seem to have headphones hurt my ears often so I'm not knocking a star for this.I have many pares and the current other pairs Im wearing are the plantations which cost $110 dollars and they hurt my ears also. The only ones that don't hurt are my LG HBS 900 which are about ready to die.All in All  love the sound and will be using these for all day use except for working in the yard.

I purchased this item for my son-in-law who is very discriminating about electronic gear.

Great Headphones and Amazing Customer Service


I researched every wireless headphones I could find on Amazon and went with these.  The sound quality is an improvement over my old headphone. My old headphones would lose bluetooth range and skip at the shortest distances.  These Senso headphones have amazing range.  The buttons allowing you to change volume and track are really great while working out, your phone can stay in your pocket.  One day they stopped turning on, I reached out to Invotek and got a response amazingly fast.  We tried troubleshooting but could not get them to power on.  Invotek sent out a replacement pair that showed up 2 days later.  The customer service alone will keep me recommending these to friends or strangers on the internet.

Good for running


I had a hard time with these at first until I figured out that you have to hold down the multi-purpose button until a woman's voice says that it is now on, and same thing to turn it off. But they fit well and nothing's fallen off yet. Lightweight and flexible, decent sound quality.12/21/2020: I dropped these - not from a great height - but the volume control pad on top and the on/off pad on the side both popped off, about a month ago. I managed to get them on again but not sure how long they will stay in. I've not been running since. I don't want to use glue in case it gunks up the works. Shall update after I take them back for a run. Wanted to post this for a sense of how robust/long weariing they might be.

Works better than I could have hoped! Just really loud with some apps on my phone.


These are great! I love the noise canceling, and they don't ever fall out of my ears. The bluetooth connection is super! The only thing i would say annoys me specifically is the volume levels if you have a samsung galaxy and are using Google Play Music. I had the S6 and now an S8 and they both don't seem to get quite quite enough. I had the volume on the minimum levels for both phone and earbuds, and it's still too loud sometimes. When I'm watching youtube or facebook videos, volume is fine. Netflix and Hulu can be too loud if I'm watching certain shows. The sound quality is still great. You get all the bass through treble levels in the audio without sacrifice, and the balance is great.

Great sound!  Decent battery life, and suoerb value for the price!


After a few weeks.. I have to say I'm fairly impressed.  Quality construction, great sound, 5 hrs of battery life, and easy connectivity.  So far they've lasted through several sweaty workouts and cycling trips.  My only issue is that they don't always feel secure in my ears.  The hooks don't actually touch my ears, so the only thing ever keeping these in place is the buds.  I do wish there were clips included.  There are little pieces,to help control excess length of cord, bit they don't work very well.But overall, a great product, price is more than a bargain for the qualityAlso includes a great case, two usb cords, a car usb poet, and includes two memory foam ear buds along with the standard rubber selection

Worth the Purhase


If you're like me you are looking for a good set of Bluetooth, wireless earbuds. I previously went through 3 pairs of Motorola S11's. Each one would last about 2-3 months and then one earbud would lose sound. I really liked the Motorola because the earbuds were connected by a headband. So I wasn't so sure about these, at first.After about 4 months of using these I can honestly say I am very impressed and glad I bought them!Sound: Excellent! It the bass and tremble on these are appropriate and you can really hear the music clearly, but at the same time have the heavy bass.Range: I often use these working out or lawn work. I have my iPhone 7 in my pocket or to my side. I have yet to have any issue with connectivity or range.Battery: Awesome. I did not charge these for the first time until about a month after I bought them, which was about 8-10 hours of use. One issue, when connected to my iPhone 7, the batter never displays lower than 70% battery life. I found out the hard way this isn't accurate as the headphones dies while running a 5K. So far, this is the only issue I have had with these.Fit: These things fit wonderfully in my ears. They have a wrap your ears. I have yet to have any issue with the falling out or feeling uncomfortable.Durability: I have sweated and sweated while using these and have not had one issue.Overall, I would recommend these. As a bonus, they are the same headphones Luke Cage wears on his Netflix show, so there's that.

So far so good


These are the second pair of iPhone 7 compatible headphones I ordered from Amazon. I went with plug ins (CCTRO MFI certified lighting) first and they were awful!! Didn't work straight out the box! So they'll be getting a terrible review.. but these Senso's are really good.. the price was right and the battery life seems to go the distance.. haven't needed to use them for more then two hours at a time before I was able to charge (but according to the little bar I hadn't even used 20%) so for $35 or whatever they cost I'm happy.. the ear hooks should be removable.. if I had one complaint.. There a little big and if you're wearing sunglasses and a hat they kind of feel odd.  But you can adjust them yourself to make them comfy so... 4.5 stars.. but I've only had them a week so talk to me in a year lol.

Didn't fit my ears


1.Sound was great.2.Mine came with one pair of small and large ear tips sizes, and a red memory foam type one that isn't shown in the pictures.3.Carrying case was handy going to and from the gym.4.Charging cord doesn't seat fully when plugged into the earbud, so be aware of that and don't try pushing too hard.5.I received the shorter black USB cord shown in the pictures, but not the longer white one for the car charger.My biggest problem with these was the piece that wraps around my ear. Maybe my ear is small or something, but the memory foam tip that I placed in my ear was the only thing holding these in place. Once that tip was in my ear, the bar rose too high above my ear. There was no way for it to provide any kind of support to hang onto my ear. Didn't work for me, so I gave these to my son, so I'll still be looking for something else.

Bluetooth Headset


i didn't expect much from this headset, because it doesn't cost $200 and I haven't heard of this brand before. I relied on good reviews and decided to take my chance. I'm glad I did. First, the delivery was fast, it came sooner than it was promised. Second, it fits perfect in my ears. I've used it for the past week, every day. I run, do cardio, pull weights, jump. They don't fall. It comes with different earbud sizes, to fit bigger or smaller ears. Third, the audio quality is really good. Clear, no distortion. I never owned more expensive and famous brands, so I can't really compare it to anything else. But I'm happy with the sound. Can't say much about how long last the battery. I workout for two and a half hours, and listen to the music all this time nonstop. But when I get home I charge it so it won't stop on me on the next day. So I can't say how long would it last if I don't charge it right away. I talked on the phone using this set only once. I had no problem hearing the person. But the person that I was talking to couldn't hear me well, I had to increase the volume to the highest.I'm very happy with my purchase. Would buy it again and would definitely recommend it.

I sometimes hit it and shut the headphones off.  Will definitely recommend to friends.Ok I have used them for a while and if I am doing a standing leg stretch or anything where I am bent over and my phone is more than 4 feet away the ear buds cut in and out.  If I have it in my pocket it is fine but if I put it down on the ground next to me it cuts in and out.  Not sure if I would still recommend them...Update... inside my gym I can be 20+ feet from my phone and I still have Bluetooth... great buy would highly recommend buying them and will be buying another pair

Senso S-250 ActivBuds Fail Miserably in Light Wind


The S-250 Senso ActiveBuds work great for indoor use, but fail miserably when they are used outside in any light wind. After pairing the headphones to my phone all was great as I was listening to music while I prepared to go for a bicycle ride.  As soon as I started to move with a very light breeze the wind noise in my ears was most uncomfortable to the point where I could not hear the music.  If I shielded the ear pod with my hand the wind noise would subside in the shielded ear while continuing to roar in the unshielded ear. This issue is no doubt a design problem that must be addressed before anyone should consider purchasing this product if you have any intention of ever using these headphones outside.  I purchased two sets of these headphones, one for my wife and the other for myself and I will be returning them both for a full refund of my money so I can purchase a brand that can be used outdoors.

They were o.k


They are so loose on my ears. The piece that goes over your ear is not adjustable. So they feel like they are going to fall off at any moment. It makes them clumsy and is not a good fit. Even if they were noise canceling I would know because of the loose fit. The sound is not too bad. I would have returned them but I waited too long.

Defiantly worth it.


I have been using these for a month and enjoying the heck out of them. They have been a solid pair of headphones with good sound and a great battery.The water resistance is a huge plus, I use them at work and don't have to worry about them. I had always had to stop listening to music to spray off the mats, now I just keep rolling through the night.The built in microphone only gives a minimal amount of difference from my phone (that could also just be from the size of my head).Only thing that I have noticed that gets me... not enough to loose a star, I wish the case was just a little bigger. Once I turned then on closing the case, so they where dead when I pulled them back out. So just a grrr for the inconvenience but that was on me.

Great quality and reliability but read full review


Great Bluetooth headphones, hands down! But can can you please consider this suggestion that many others may agree with? Please make it so that I can connect another device and automatically bump the previously connected device! I have gotten so frustrated looking of the last device that I connected to disconnect so that I can connect to another device. For example, I have a MacBook, an iPhone and an iPad. If I was connected to my MacBook last night while working and taking calls, and then I wanted to connect the headphones to my iPhone while in range with my MacBook, I have to disconnect from the MacBook because the headphones automatically connect to the last connected device.

The Senso package came in a very timely manner with everything promised in the box.  The instructions that came with the package are short and straight to the point, nothing to sift through to get to what you need.  They were simple to connect to my iPhone.  As the package describes, these are sport wireless earbuds.  When I exercise walked this morning I had no issues with them falling out.  I wear glasses and had no interference or discomfort.  Ease of use was great, basically everything I needed while in use was at the tip of my right finger.Now for the sound: When I exercise I want something base-y and loud.  These earbuds were AWESOME!  I am so pleasantly surprised.Bottom Line: I would definitely buy these again and suggest them to a friend.  For the price and year warranty it's worth it for sure.

It had a nice package and a well equipped set of charger


The Earbuds Do Not Stay !!!!I just received my order last night. It had a nice package and a well equipped set of charger, case, earbuds & ... but I am so CONFUSED abut the22000 reviews on this product. I purchased it based on all the reviews and to my SURPRISE IT DOES NOT EVEN STAY IN MY EAR FOR AN HOUR.I tried it on at home while I was running errands in my house and I had to adjust it every few minutes and overtime I was trying to tuck it in my year my hand would touch the ON/OFF button on the earbud and it will turn off. The ear pieces are so mall there is no other room to fid for adjusting it and your finger will hit the ON/OFF button. It finally fell off despite many attempts. I do work out at the gym and jogging in nature so this headphone does not do me service. I do not understand how other people did nit mention this in their reviews.

Nice earphones


Very well made,  The HD  is crystal clear,I have had two or three  other brand's.....And these are by far the best.I really like the on-ear control's,  I have poor dexterity, And find  it hard to  get to the control's on a wire.And the manufactuer's button.....that makes it easy to get to, power/stand-byAre very good at blocking out surrounding noise.This is exactly what I look for in Bluetooth earphones,  something that sound's great, and have ear controls.When I first got these (the new design)  The ear-hooks where gel,  since....the gel has worn out, making it hard to conform to my ear's.Other then then that.... Great......Would Definitely Recommend!!

I can see why these are popular


Not bad for $36, but could be a lot better. The audio quality is ok; the earbuds have trouble with some bass frequencies, which sets them into a crackling noise. Nonetheless, they are much better than my MPow Magnetos and the MPow Swift, with far more depth and sparkle. Other notes; they are rather large and noticeable, the ear loops cannot be removed except with a pair of scissors, I liked the on-ear skip/volume buttons, the extra goodies are almost worth the price, beautifully boxed, awesome case, and fairly easy to fit, given the 4 different pairs of tips. IDK, at the end of the day, I am returning these to look for a better earbud pair (somewhere). Perhaps I am just not a fan of ear loops.

Great sound quality, excellent battery life


I ordered the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones in preparation for my Pixel 2 XL phone which has no headphone jack (sad). I did not want to spend more than 50$ on earphones, and these ones seemed to be the top rated on amazon. I've been using them for a few days now and they have exceeded my expectations. The headphones come in a nice case, with a charger and extra earbuds. They also seem to have an iphone charger adaptor fitted on top of a standard USB charger which feels very premium. The sound from these is much better than the Beats earphones that I've used in the past. I don't like the placement of the button on the side, but I think that's the only con with these. The battery life has not been disappointing - Lasted a good 2 hours before I stopped using them. The wire connecting the earbuds is a tad too long in my opinion and could have been shorter, but it's nothing major to stop anyone from buying these. I'd definitely recommend going ahead with buying them!

I returned them.  If you are looking for a budget pair of wireless earbuds, these will suffice.  If you are particular about the quality (sound and fit) you may be disappointed.  My dislike was largely from the wind noise that was constant as I wore them running.  Also, the sound quality was ok.. but not spectacular.  Lastly, I did not really care for the fit. They seemed to hurt my ears some.  I returned them and spent the extra money for PowerBeats and am much happier.  These are NOT a bad product... especially if you are looking for a basic pair of wireless earbuds and don't care too much about the the things I mentioned.  Admittedly, I am very particular, so your mileage may vary.

Better than average


I've had about 15 different brands of theses over the ear BT headphones and these were, until recently, the best...not just for the value but sound quality better than all others except Beats & Bose.Comfort:  Handles sprints, jumping and long distance without falling out like most others.Range:  1/2 the length of basketball court before getting choppySkipping:  Never skips when in rangeConnection:  Not very good.  Often need to power off/on a few cycles to connect.Button location: Most BTs cram the buttons making it hard to find the right button.  This has the power on side and volume on top; very nice.Calls:  Good/AverageCharge:  Similar to most...good

Great headphones with extras!


Purchased these to try out wireless headphones without spending a lot of money on the more popular brand names. Turned out to be a fantastic purchase! Headphones are well made and comfortable - a little bigger than some but not too bulky for a smaller person. They come with 3 sizes of interchangeable ear pads & a strap adjuster to find the right fit. Sound quality is very good; not truely noise canceling but drown out most background things when fit snugly in ears. Have handled daily wear plus sweat & rain during workouts with no problems! Bluetooth pairing is simple. Bonus that they come with a carrying case, charging cable (also fits nicely in case), plus a combo lightning/micro USB cable & a dual USB port car charger. Overall super happy with the purchase for the quality & price!

Buyers remorse.


They are made of high quality materials. However any amount of interference between the device and the Bluetooth source usually cuts off the music, audio stutters and information is lost. Even just the act of bending down at the waist was enough to consistently disconnect my pairing and the sound would go to shit.  More disappointing is that any objects between you and the device will cut audio. A work desk. Sitting forward. Kneeling down.  The range is terrible, can't hold signal from my head to my pants pocket... garbage..  but when it is connected how ever briefly it sounds pretty good.  Written from phone. Typos

Great product, great value!


This product is great for the price! Keep in mind that you're buying a $30 Bluetooth earbud set. The fact that it is sweat proof and that it's Bluetooth would be enough to warrant the price alone. The sound quality is alright. If you're used to using high end products you will notice a difference, but these still sound good.Where this product shines is in the fact that they went above and beyond what they needed to. In your package you will get several replacement ear buds, and a pretty slick case. but to boot, you get two charging cables for the device. And to top everything off they include a two port car charger. all of these additional goodies gave me good enough reason to leave a full 5 star review. Great product, great value!

Great value - until they got wet


These were the highest rated “waterproof” ear buds.Tremendous value!!!However, having brought them to the pool...They still worked after Getting wet, but you could barely hear them. Once they dried out they appear to be fine. Now that I know the imitation, they are great quality.PS: I broke the internal on one of the ear loop, through constant fiddling. My bad.I like them well enough to buy a second pair. I would recommend them.

Connectivity issues


These buds are fine when they work which is 80% of the time.  I am using them with a Pixel 2 to listen to audible books while walking, about 1 hour 40 minutes per day.  I can use them for three days like this on a charge.  Sometimes they disconnect from the phones Bluetooth for no apparent reason.  Recently it took me 30 minutes to get them re-connected.  Often the sound is ""pixelated"" and you miss about 30% of the content.  I cannot wear the cord around the back of my neck or the pixelation of sound is terrible.  This means I get to wear it like a chinstrap, looking like an idiot.  sometimes you can start and stop play from the button on the buds and sometimes not.  They are janky to say the least.

Not as good as all the reviews say!


I got these on a bit of a whim since I needed BT earphones. It’s hard to ignore 25,000 reviews, the majority of them positive. However I have been very disappointed in the fit and sound quality of these earphones.  Admittedly my ears are weird and I have trouble finding ear tips that are big enough. But I couldn’t get these to stay in at all using the largest tips I could find.  These earphones also sound very flat. No bass and very little trebble. I recently got a pair of earphones from Anker and they are much better on both counts.  I now regret purchasing these. Don’t make the same mistake!

Seriously, though. Totally worth it.


I've got to say, I was a huge skeptic about bluetooth earphones. I was always afraid my music would cut out or they wouldn't stay in my ear or the sound quality would be bad or the battery would die. None of these are concerns with these headphones!The distance of connect-ability is pretty high. Compared to my Arctis7 headset for my PC, the range is decent. I can get out of the room and down the hall before the bluetooth disconnects.These earphones came with a memory-foam type of ear bud (along with three sizes of the typical semi-hemispherical rubber/silicon) that are great! I thought I would give them a try as I'm not a major fan of typical earbud styles and I loved them! They conform to the beginning of my ear canal and stay put! No falling out while exercising or anything!Sound quality is decent, bass isn't anything to write home about, but songs sound pretty amazing. They're definitely better than any pair of headphones you'd find at a local market, by ten fold.[b]Battery life is consistent!![/b] I've had these headphones for a few months now and have consistently gotten over 7 hours of use out of them before I would charge them!Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend these headphones if anyone is in the market for bluetooth! Screw paying upwards of $100-200 for ""high quallity bluetooth"" headphones! THESE ARE LESS THAN $30 AND WILL BLOW YOU AWAY! Seriously, though. Totally worth it.

Good buy!


These are a really good buy at an exceptional price. I use them outside of workouts (as headphones for work), but so far the clarity and sound are amazing. My only problem is with the fit of the headphones over my ears and the bud fitting snug inside my ear. I have to work with them for a few minutes before they are a doable fit so that I can get on with my work. Once I do, they are fine for a while then slide right back out of place. (Side note: is there a trick to solve this issue?)  Again, I do realize I am utilizing them different than most probably, but I was looking for a good, inexpensive product and this one had solid rave reviews. I think they serve my purpose,  except for that one small glitch in design.

All I have to say is that after two and half years of serious use, training, abuse, etc - these things have NOT failed me.  They sound great, last a long time, take all kinds of abuse, charge quick and easy - they just do EVERYTHING right.  There is not a single doubt that I am buying these again - if they ever even die on me.  I love finding a great product at a great price.

Great purchase, would definitely buy again!


These earbuds are well worth the money, I have had them for over a year and they still work great. I run almost every day and the constant use and sweat doesn't seem to affect it's battery life which lasts me about a week per charge. The over ear things that keep them on are easily bent to fit my ear shape and hold the position very well. Bluetooth connection is easy and fast too. Only problem is that when you press the pause button twice quickly it redials the last person you called unlike any other earbuds/headphones I have used where this action skips the song you are listening to. Other than calling people randomly during my runs every now and then these are a great purchase and are definitely worth the money. P.S. Im not sponsored by SENSO in any way, but a free pair would be awesome :)

My Sons were very happy with this headset


My Sons were very happy with this headset.  I plan to buy one for myself in the future should my current head set go bad.  They sound clear to both the listener and the speaker and the range is pretty good.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for set of Bluetooth headphones.  The included car charger and multifunctional charging cable is an added bonus.  Even the packaging was above par.  I would not hesitate to purchasing these in the future.  My Son comments is he loves them cause they do not fall of when jogging.  My other son wants to test them in the shower, I told him not to test fate, but its nice to know they can withstand water and sweat.  Great investment

Quite satisfactory


These seem to be always on sale way below their MSRP. For that, they are very nice. However, I would not pay full price for these headphones.They come in a nice case with a lot of different ear options. Personally, I stick with the memory-foam-like material because they are quite comfortable.Wind interference is not much of an issue. Walking on a windy beach or walking, in general, is fine with little to no wind resistance. Driving with the windows down is a little bit more annoying, but nothing horrible.Sometimes the headphones will turn on if bumped enough in their carrying case.They will last a full day if charged over night. Unless youre listening to bass-heavy music all the time, as these headphones have a very nice low-end.

Sound/work fantastic, just somehow freezes up phone.


The headphones sound great, they fit comfortably, they're easy to pair, the controls and microphone work like a charm, and they're definitely water proof. I got caught in a downpour at work that literally killed my phone, yet these headphones took it like a champ. But, with that said, they have a tendency to completely freeze my phone up when using the built in music controls. It happens at least once a day; the only way to fix it is to either remove the battery or hold the phone's power button down for 10+ seconds to reboot. And I'm not just talking about one phone, it's even doing it on my replacement phone, which is a whole different brand. So there's that. Otherwise they're great.

Excellent product.


I love these headphones. I've had them for about a year now. For the price, they are phenomenal. I haven't tested the waterproof side of them past running with them when it's drizzling. I think that the 8-hr battery life is a stretch; I haven't had them last that long. However, I did notice that the distance from whatever your using as the device (i.e. phone) significantly affects the battery life. If I leave my phone in one place while at the gym and am moving around with varying distances, the battery drains much quicker. Whereas, if I have my phone in my back pocket the whole time, the battery lasts a lot longer. The longest I've gone in one sitting was 4 hrs. They charge up very quick. The sound is great when listening to music. I've never had any issues with them dropping calls or being able to pick up my voice. They came with several different charging cords so you can charge at home or in your vehicle. It also came with several different earbuds so you can fit them in whatever size ears you have. Overall, excellent product and definitely recommend this product.

Great value. Great fit.


5 stars means perfection - a cut above the rest . My only issue was that my phone's bluetooth connection flaked out (my fault) and the headset would no longer connect  to the phone.  After a few minutes of self-discovery that I didn't know what I was doing, I went to the owners manual but the print is pretty small and I could not read it.  However, Senso has a free manual on the internet and within minutes the problem was fixed.  The packaging  included 3 additional sets of rubber nubs to ensure a secure fit with some  noise reducing capabilities.  The fit is perfect. I am a long distance runner and have not experienced and discomfort from having them on for hours at a time. Hope this helps

Great sound and value for the price


At the $36.97 price point these are unbeatable.  I use them at the gym, running outdoors, mowing the lawn, and around the house.Pros-Price-Fit my ears perfectly out of the box (other earpiece sizes are also included) and, most importantly, don't fall out when I run-No BT connection issues so far.  I mostly use them with my phone in an armband (about 12"" away) or in my pocket (about 3' away).-Clear, full sound.  I listen to rock, punk, country, hip-hop, podcasts, etc, everything sounds great.-Battery life is great.  I use them about an hour a day and charge them every couple of days just to be safe.-The big, easily accessible pause button on the right earpiece is very handy.Cons-Just one: The cord that connects the two earpieces will twist itself into knots behind your head if you don't smooth out all the kinks before putting them on.  As long as you take a second to make sure the cord isn't twisted first, you'll forget it's there.  If you don't, it will eventually bunch up behind one of your ears and become very irritating.HIGHLY recommended if you are in the market for inexpensive BT earphones to throw in your backpack, gym bag, etc.

Better than i could have hoped for...


These are awesome! Bought them to use while walking my dogs, found that headphones with any sort of cord were a pain. Not only are these comfortable, but they also came with an adapter for Android and iPhones, 3 different sizes of ear buds, a charger AND a car adapter. All in a cute and study little round carrying case. Really more than I was expecting. Super easy to pair with my phone and other devices. One of the earphones also has buttons for volume, ffwarding songs,  picking up phone calls, all while never having to even think about pulling out your phone. Love them, thinking ood buying some as gifts. Oh,  and they are comfortable and don't fall out so the sound is great. Thumbs up!

Great headphones with a great fit at a great price


I'm impressed with the headphones.  Apple's earbuds never stay in my ears and other in-ear Bluetooth headphones are hit and miss.  I have one ear most fit great.  The other ear must be a little different shape—it never matters what adapter tip I use, I have trouble with in-ear headphones.  These have the over-the-ear loop.  The loops are comfortable because they're flexible, but they keep the headphones right where they belong.  A perfect win for me.  I have about 6 hours logged on the headphones so far, and they remain paired consistently without issue (better than others I've used in the past).I haven't used them to make a call yet, but they are excellent for music and audiobooks.

Bang for the buck I couldn’t be happier. I’m an audio engineer and know these aren’t designed for pristine sound so I wasn’t disappointed. But with that said, they provide plenty of amplitude and the battery life is really good for the money. The right channel is a tad quieter than when they were brand new but I still really enjoy these. I’m a heavy sweater who lives in the south and I use them daily and after 5 months they’re still going strong. Would recommend.

Best value headphones


I was really worried about this product and I thought it was not going to last very long but it has been used consistantly for a year and it is still going strong! I have over charged it many of times (leaving it in the fast charger over night or the entire day on accident) and it still keeps a charge for multiple days of working out. It fits comfortably on my ears. My only complaint would be... I find the noise canceling benefit of putting the earbuds completely in your ear completely uncomfortable when you run or work out so I usually leave some room in my ear for circulation. Overall would recommend this product for quality and durability and price.

UPDATE: does not work after 5 months


Since the new iPhone does not have an audio jack, I wanted to be able to charge my phone and listen to music at the same time.  My commutes are very long, which means there are high chances not having enough battery and also, needing to listen to music.  I couldn't give up either!  So I figured buying wireless headphones was the next best thing!$: Great price!! I wanted to try such headphones before committing to expensive ones.  I think these are a great alternative to buying the expensive wireless headsets.Usage: Used them in a half marathon and it was great until my ears were sweating and they kept falling out / I used them when I lift as well and they slip out when I bend over to do deadlifts and such (maybe it's my ears?)Sound: Quality is good, not greatMisc: The wire tie came off the first time and I lost it. The company was so nice in mailing me a new one.  Thanks Invotek!Overall, 5-stars for the product and promptness of company fulfilling my needs and ended up keeping these after all =)::UPDATE::My headphones stopped working after 5-months. I'm pretty bummed because I resorted to the headphones that the iPhone came with =( I can't find contact info to contact about the issue since it comes with a one year warranty. Very disappointed!

Worth geting


I've used my pair for other a year now, taking them with me to work every day and using the nearly constantly and consiently, so I can attest that they're quite solid and resilient to normal abuse. They're convenient to use, easy to pause music at a moment's notice and such, and I find that the adjustable ear piece works well for hooking it onto your shirt if you're not comfortable with it sitting on your neck Sadly mine have to be retired after a little over a year. Due to a power issue on the inside (I opened it up and couldn't figure it out so i'm buying a new pair for my gf and I) it is shutting off on its own, but it did last beyond its warranty and for such a low price! I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want those singular bluetooth earbuds, and I'll be ordering a new pair pair after I hit the Submit button.

Worst headphones I've ever used! The Bluetooth simply doesn't work for bike riding.


These are the worst headphones I have ever owned. I bought them to use it when I ride my bike. The Bluetooth connection constantly goes in and out and they're unusable. I have tried rebooting the headphones by telephone, and the connection to no avail. They appear to be a quality product but they simply do not work the Bluetooth connection is awful. This is a brand new top-of-the-line phone and it connects to everything that I've ever tried to connect you via Bluetooth without a problem. I'm returning them. Can anybody recommend good Bluetooth headphones reasonably priced that I can use on my bicycle?

Nice headphones. I looked at several different pairs of headphones and decided to get these. I’m glad I did so far.Pros: good sound, easy to connect, comfortable with many different tips, great charging cable and case, the over the ear piece is moldable.Cons: the buttons are challenging at first, the charging port is hard to get to and the little plastic piece broke off the 2nd time I charged them, the led indicator is hard to see(a pro & con) and there is a special code for the blinking lights that you are supposed to remember.Overall they are a great pair of headphone. My favorite part is the red cushion tips provided. They are great for fitting in your ear and then expanding to block out noise.

Great phones; excellent service!


I really like these headphones!  My only beef is I'm having trouble getting the left earbud to stay in place.  No, it doesn't come completely off of my ear, but the bud pulls away from my ear canal a bit after working out for 20 or more minutes.  I'm not marking down the product, however, for 2 reasons:1. I think the problem is with my ear and not the earbuds.  The bud in the right ear fits snuggly and comfortably.2.  They provide 3 different bud sizes.  I've tried all 3 and no matter what I do it still comes a bit loose.  So, they've done their due diligence to ensure their customers find a bud that properly fits their ears.  Kudos!The sound quality is very good for the price point ... probably superior to others at the same price point as other reviewers have noted.  The noise cancelling capabilities are very good as well.Additionally, the customer service is outstanding.  I had an issue within the first couple of days (turned out to be a signal interference issue) and they responded with a solution within 24 hours.  They've also checked in on me more than once to ask how I'm enjoying the product.

Save your money for a real pair


I bought these for running, typically 40-60 min, 5x per week. I didn’t want to invest much for my first Bluetooth set and chose these based on Amazon’s recommendation. I found them comfortable with decent material quality, but the wiring never fully straightened out from its wound up packaging shape.I killed the first pair after two runs when I accidentally jumped into pool with set in my pocket. I waited a few days to dry out and when the battery still charged I was impressed enough to reorder since it was clearly my fault. Because hey if battery is sealed well enough to withstand total submersion they must be good, right?Second pair started having problems almost immediately. They were very difficult to pair with iPhone. Phone would show headset icon but volume played through phone speaker. It required multiple toggles through music and podcast apps before Bluetooth would truly connect. Worse, they would malfunction during runs, typically around 30 min. They would freak out: calling up Siri, attempting to make phone calls, losing Bluetooth connection. Very rarely could I complete a run without these crapping out. Over and over problems would occur. Eventually they just stopped pairing with my phone altogether and now sit unused for over a month.In conclusion they might be fine if you use to walk but I would avoid for higher intensity workouts. I don’t believe they are constructed well-enough to withstand the sweat. The price might be cheap, but sometimes cheap is just that.

The pair easily and the sound is really good


I'll admit I haven't watched the video on these but here's my review so far. The pair easily and the sound is really good. I like the cord instead of the headband style I had previously. They stay on my head with a lot of movement. No problem listening to music but the main complaint I have is that when I'm on a call, hang up from that call, then get another call they don't automatically come through the headphone. I have to go to my settings and click the headphones then there's the transfer to the headphones and the caller often here's that and will day what was that noise. In addition I've missed information during the transfer.

Good for the price


I've been using these for...almost a year now? Overall, I'm satisfied with these headphones, and they're good for the price. I usually prefer wired headphones, but I wanted wireless ones for the gym, and these do the trick. I'm not much of an audiophile, and am not too picky about the sound, so to me these sound fine. But, I don't think they sound as good as the headphones that come with your iPhone (my only point of reference--I don't invest in anything more expensive). Side note: the phone car mount that these come with is awesome. I didn't realize it would come in the package, so that was a nice surprise. It's magnetic, simple, low profile....I would give it 5 stars, but that's not what this review is for.There are 3 kind of annoying things about these, which aren't a huge deal considering the price....but they are worth mentioning:First, the charging port is super tricky to access. The little piece of rubber that covers it is really hard to get off, even with longer nails. It also can get in the way of charging if you aren't careful. I once left these plugged in for a few hours to charge, only to find out that the rubber cover was ever-so-slightly blocking the port, and they ended up not charging whatsoever. I ripped the cover off after that.Second, when they start to run low on battery, you only have a very short amount of warning time before they die. You'll hear them say ""battery low,"" and at that point you have maybe 20 minutes before they die. Before that point, it's pretty much impossible to know exactly how much juice they have left, so it's hard to prepare for unless you're really good about charging them frequently. Another warning sign that I've noticed is that they tend to get quieter when they get low on power. I find myself cranking up the volume just before they die, and then after they've had a chance to fully charge I'll notice that they sound much louder, and I have to turn it back down again. Maybe this is true for all bluetooth headphones, I'm not sure, but it is kind of annoying.Finally, they just don't fit my ears well, and I constantly have to readjust them. Yes, they come with different sized cushions, but it doesn't make a huge difference for me. I have always had a problem with this style of headphones (ones that go in your ear canal) not fitting properly, and these are no exception. It's kind of a personal problem, but if you're like me and struggle with this style, you will likely still struggle with this pair. But, I ordered these knowing that this would be a problem, so it's not really fair to judge them based on my ear anatomy.All in all, they get the job done, and are a good deal considering how insanely expensive wireless headphones are. Even though I spent a bunch of time talking about the flaws of these headphones, those really are just minor annoyances, and I plan to keep using these until they break or I lose them. As long as you aren't expecting perfection, you'll be happy with these.

The 2022 version of these is a major drop in quality


I purchased these originally in 2017, and got four good years of heavy usage out of them. I would rate that model at least 4 stars.  When they stopped charging a few months ago, I purchased the same product. I noticed right away they were cheaper, lighter, and much lower quality.  The on/off button was a bit tricky and never worked well, and is now locked inside the unit, and will not work.  I've used these fairly lightly in the last few months, so it's really disappointing to note such a drastic change in the quality of this product.  I've ordered a different brand to replace these.

Big Disappointment !!


I bought the Senso earbud to replace the one i bought last year on prime day thinking it would be as good  as the one from last year. It was a total disapointment., quality has reduced drastically . It is a shame that the manufacturer will mess up a great product.I had high hopes for this earbud because the one that i lost was very good, so i assume the replacement would be good as well.Firstly, the connection breaks constantly even with earbud in line of sight of my phone or any device connected to the earbud .  The sound quality is terrible, bass is long gone,i can go on and on.I will be returning this item.  It's a shame that a quality product has been compromised.

not for those with small ears


I have been using these for the past couple of weeks and they are not bad for the price that you pay. I also didn't realize that you can buy just the earphones without the accessories and save yourself $10 since i ended up giving my accessories away to family/friends because I have them already. The range is as they claim, the battery life is exceptional, the sound quality is normal. It's not super great yet I can't say it's horrible either.  I'm a petite Asian woman and yesterday was a rare day that I wore the headphones for over 6 hours. Not consecutively, but during my work shift at the office, it culminated in about 6 hours of wear time. Unfortunately, the ear buds finally started to hurt my ears and even gave me a headache. I used the smallest buds that came with it too. There were only 3 options of ear buds. Are there smaller ones available? The best thing about these headphones is the battery life.

Decent pair for the price


PROSI used the headphones while jumping rope, lifting weights, and running on the treadmill, and on the train. I sweat a lot during workouts and had no issues with it slipping off. Can’t hear background noises on the train I’ve only been using the headphones for two days but so far so good. The headphones are also light weight.Carrying case is geniusCONYou are able to talk on the phone but my friends heard an echo or a lot of background noise.Some of the songs I listened too off of Apple Music had better quality than others.

Satisfied A Tough Customer.  These Buds Are Outstanding!


First, I paid full price for these, and I always expect more than I usually get.  With a 4.5 star average after thousands of reviews I expected these to be pretty fantastic.  For once a product EXCEEDED my expectations!  Very good price for the quality of these great sounding sport buds.  At the gym I had been using wired buds and it was just kind of a hassle, but they sounded great (1 Mores Triple Drivers).  Figured with the Bluetooth buds sound would greatly suffer.  These Senso buds are pretty darn good.  Great bass, more than the triple drivers, and overall surprisingly enjoyable sound.  For working out I prefer these.  Comfort level is great, controls easy to operate, and they look good!  Very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend👍

Excellent Quality Product For The Price


Granted, I just purchased this and set them up today but they compare favorably to the Beats that just broke after a year and a half.  About 70% less than my original Beats.  Not quite as clear on the bottom as the Beats, but I'm using them for the gym, so who cares?  The telling thing will be if they have interference from all the machines at the gym.  I would expect not as they are the latest Bluetooth technology.  They are lighter than the Beats so I expect to have less falling out of my ear issues.  Fit the ears great.UPDATE: June 12, 2017.  Absolutely no interference in the gym from any equipment.  Stayed in place in my ears for an hour and a half workout on elliptical and bike.

I've had a pair of these for a little over 2 years, the wires are now exposed near each ear piece, I have to angle the charger to get them to charge, yet they are still kicking.  I've been rough on these too. Catching them in the shoulder portion of a seat belt, ripping them from my head :) still working great. When these die, I'll be ordering another pair.

Great headphones....for a while


I've had these headphones for a couple years now and the bluetooth radio has finally failed.  However, up until this point, these have been great headphones.  They sound really good, battery life is as-advertised however there is no noise cancellation that I can tell.If I could make one change, I would want to have a fabric-coated cable.  The current cable has a rubber-coated feel and when you get sweaty, it sticks to your neck, which is annoying.Other than that concern, I will likely order these again as you can't beat the price for what you get.

There are better out there


TLDR: Audio cuts out constantly. You're better off buying a different set of headphonesI bought this last year and did not use it as much as this year. At first there were some issues with the audio cutting in and out, but I assumed it was because I'm usually using it in a room filled with other people using bluetooth and there might be some interference. Now I know that is not the issue. I have been biking to and from school which is not far at all and I use these to listen to music along the way. My phone is either in my breast pocket or on my mount and I still have the audio cutting in and out. There is nothing else that is interfering with it at all. I've even had the phone in my hand about 1 foot away from the headphones and they would still cut out. It is ridiculous.  I've had 2 different phones and it happened to them both. Other than the audio cutting out everything else is great, but it gets extremely annoying while I'm trying to enjoy some music while biking or even at the gym.

New design is painful and uncomfortable


Read before buying--These used to be great headphones for the price.  I recently bought these as a replacement for my previous Senso pair I had used for years without problem.  I expected to receive the same product but I didn't.  They cut a corner on these that significantly affects the comfort the previous pair had.The ear hooks on the previous pair were covered with a nice rubber coating so during prolonged exercise yours ears never hurt and you'd forget they're even there, the ear hooks are now made of hard plastic.  It's painful and uncomfortable from the moment you put them on.  The other design they changed is that the hooks themselves used to be pliable so you could form them exactly to fit your ear, smaller, larger, whatever the case may be.  These do not form, it's just hard plastic and it's way too large to hold snug on your ears.Really disappointed Senso, you had a phenomenal product.  I checked out your newer version and they look like they suffer from the same downgrades.  Here's an idea, cut out the useless excessories (ex: cell phone card holder sleeve?) and focus on bringing the product comfort back to where it used to be.

Bought two for my wife and I over two years ago to use while exercising in the gym.  Use them for ~1 hr 5-7x/week.  No problems so far.  Connects quickly and sounds ok to us.  I like that they are secure on our ears unlike ear buds which we cannot stand. We are not audiophiles just looking for a quality sound for a reasonable price.  Recommend.

Buy these Quality WaterProof WorkOut HeadPhones Instead


I picked these up to be a pair of comfortable budget wireless headphones for relaxing when in a bath, shower or just allowed to wear relaxed when working out. I bought these to compare to the Plantronics BackBeat Fit which also has a IP rating for waterproofing and I must say between the price and quality of everything these were the way to go. At a Price of $32 you get a great pair of comfortable and loud waterproof headphones for every scenario that I have found that has a very average microphone but still better when working out then the Plantronics BackBeat Fit. Between the better mic, louder sound and more comfortable design while still being waterproof and half to a third of the price this is a definite buy for your workout or relaxation at the beach/pool days.Pros:Loud but Clear SoundVery ComfortableTruly WaterproofButtons are Crisp to PressLots of Accessories included for Everything You'll Want or NeedCons:Microphone is Okay Quality at BestMaterial of Headset can Feel a Bit Cheap

Not bad, you get what you pay for


Sound quality is decent. Bluetooth connection can drop in and out, especially when first connected. Headphones don’t like moving from wifi, it makes an annoying beeping and requires restart. Battery gauge is not particularly accurate, when gauge shows about 20%, it’s about dead. When the verbal low battery warning, it actually only has about one minute left before it dies. Hour long charge time is not true, takes longer, maybe 2-3 hours. All that being said, I’ve had them for about a year, and they keep trucking along.Update: they have finally died. RIP.

Comfort and Battery Life - what more could you ask for?


I love bluetooth headsets, but have been very frustrated by poor battery life in a set of ear buds lightweight enough for workouts.  Most that I've had would only give me 2-3 hours of solid use.  But these are amazing.  Very comfortable (the ear clips are soft rubber and you don't even notice them there), and the battery life is excellent.  I charged them up on Saturday, and have used them for an average of two hours a day, mostly for listening to music and a couple phone calls.  It is Wednesday morning, and I have a 50% charge.  Sold.Just dealt with a service issue after buying my wife a set. After about a month, they just stopped working. Customer service was outstanding. Responded to my email inquiry in less than 12 hours and shipped out a replacement set same day. Sold again.

The best wireless headphones I have found in this price range....


I am so pleased with these headphones. So far of all the not so expensive bluetooth headphones I have tried, these have lasted the longest and worked the best, i use them everyday. They also stay charged longer, about 8 hours where my others were only 4 hours. I like being able to pair them with 2 devices which makes switching from one to the other easier. They  do not fall out easily and fit comfortable in my small ears.  I also must mention the awesome customer service I received when I had an issue with my headphones. Doing a factory reset takes care of most problems but if it doesn't just drop them an e-mail and they will respond quickly. So nice to find a company that treats their customers so well.

Outstanding price-performance!!!


Update (May 2, 2017): After using it for multiple weeks now, I can only say I am a very satisfied customer of this excellent product (for the price). One of the best! Their customer service is outstanding - I had lost the wire tie, and they immediately emailed me to say that they have shipped a couple of them and promised to improve it!++++++++++++++++++++++Early product review/first looks: I received this from amazon well before the guaranteed delivery time (kudos to Amazon, as always!). Product packaging was perfect, and I was pleasantly surprised to see two charging wires (short & long), and the dual-port car charger, so got impressed right away... quality & build is excellent, and bluetooth pairing worked like a charm with my iPhone 7 within seconds! Now, to the best part of all, the sound quality and loudness (at 50% volume setting, sound is booming, as other reviewers have mentioned), for the price-point is outstanding!!! All in all, I am very satisfied and happy with this purchase, and reviews by others helped me make the right decision, so big thanks to them all! Highly recommended!!!

Great set of active use bluetooth headphones


These are very good headphones and met my needs very well for several reasons.  First, they stay on the ear so you con't have to worry about them falling off.  They are not tight allowing you to hear sounds around you, though they do not have the robust base of tight headphones.  Bluetooth works well, connecting easily and working for the distance advertised (30 feet).  Battery lasts a reasonable time and I have not needed to recharge for 4 hours, the most I have used them.  Connected instantly to my phone. Easy to operate when they are on, just press the button to start/stop music or answer a call.  Speaking of a phone call, they work fine.  Quality is adequate for infrequent use.  I would get a bluetooth set specifically meant for phone use if that was a key need.  They come with a nice car charger that will replace a very old and slow charger.  A great freebee.Bottom line, this is a fine set of headphones that will meet your needs unless you really want audiophile quality.  They work great for my walks, runs and while working around the house.  One final note, the company, SENSO, has been very active in contacting me to ensure I was satisfied.  Three e-mails to be sure I received my headphones and was happy.  While I hope I never need to take advantage of their service, I am optimistic they will be very responsive.

great deal for the money.  works as expected. came with a lot of unexpected goodies like a nice carrying case, car charger, multiple earbuds, and cord management pieces.  did not come with a usb wall charger but I already have dozens of those laying around my house.  wanted something for the gym so the profile of the ear pieces are not a big deal but I wouldn't use these for my daily commuting needs since it's not very discreet looking.One odd thing was that it came with a short micro usb cable for charging but it also came with a USB to Apple Lightning type cable which makes no sense whatsoever since you can't use it on these headphones.

Hard to beat for $30


Bought these to see what a $30 replacement for my $150 Bose would sound like, and I'm pleasantly surprised. They certainly have way more volume capacity than the Bose, and for $30 these are really hard to beat. Battery life is good, still 5+ hours after 3 months of moderate to heavy use.Minor downsides: - Plastic pieces that wrap around the ear are flimsy and can crease easily, so be careful if packing the headphones loosely - Audio quality is good, but not great. I like to use them for podcasts, but if using for music the headphones lack a bit of low end depth, though not to a point where I would say it sounds bad. - Not water proof, so avoid using in the rain

Comfortable, sound great, can't beat the price. Wow.


I love these. I had low expectations, because any other ear buds I've tried fit too tightly or popped out often, or entirely blocked out the outside world noises. I've been wearing these for about 4 hours and frankly forgot about them. I'm listening to music, but don't really know they're in my ears. They're that comfortable. They did come with a variety of ear plug adapters, which was nice, since people's ears are all different. The sound quality is good. I'm no audiophile, but these sound good to me. Also, I can hear my dogs bark in the background, so I'm not shut off. I need to get out and run with these on to see how they fare with that, but so far, I'm super happy with these.

I had a little trouble with fit at first but once I got the proper silicone earpieces on it was fine.  Sound quality and volume are fantastic for this type of device. I can testify to 8.5 hrs run time on battery at TV volume, at very low level I think I got nine to ten hours a couple of times.  Range is excellent, I've been as far as 55' in my garage through 3 walls. (It depends on your transmitter of coarse.)  Customer service is top of the line!  I had a little problem with my first pair (micro usb the most likely culprit, can't blame manufacturer for that). Loved them so much I bought a second pair and customer service is sending replacement for defective one.

Deep Bass, Great For The Gym


I have been using these for a little over 2 years and I love these things. I'm a fan of bass in Bluetooth headsets and these definitely deliver that. Enough bass to make the two Bluetooth earbuds I've bought after these feel like they are just weak.Even with the two earbuds I bought after this I still come back to these. I use them for the gym and I prefer the convenience of wrapping these headphone around my neck vs needing to put them in my pocket with earbuds that are not connected.Great battery life, I believe I get around 6-9 hours on these things. Can't beat this for the price. Its not professional crisp sound quality, but has more than enough force to be used casually and focus in the gym.

I got all the way down the hall at work and suddenly realized I could still hear the music from my desk, well over 50 feet away.  Very comfortable to wear for extended periods.  Most earbuds are too large and my ears hurt after just a short time, but these came with different sizes and smaller size works perfectly.  Sound is clear and crisp.

Holy smokes!  These buds sound AWESOME!  I had some 10+ year old Ultimate Ears buds and one of the armatures finally cracked and broke.  10+ years of service so I won't complain.  That said, I was in the market for new buds.  I had no intention of buying new UEs as I just don't have the money or desire to spend $300 for ear buds.  I also wanted to finally go wireless to pair with my LG G6. The Senso price was right, but I was concerned with the output.  After 20 seconds of listening to my first song through them, I was grinning from ear to ear.  Audio tech has really advanced since buying my old UEs!  Dare I say these $40 units sound BETTER than my old UEs?  Yes, I dare!Paring was easy (took less than a minute) and for the price you get a bunch of accessories.  Very impressed so far.  We'll see how they hold up over time and use.

Decent earbuds for $30, could be better in the price range


This earphones would have been awesome around $20, there’re profits and quality still to be made.  Manufactures can charge whatever people are willing to pay just to have that particular designs or brands/status.  Talking about “status” – there are people out and about, jamming with the Dr. that are still reside inside their parents basement lol.  Still on the first charge, hopefully it will hold up to its 8 hours charge promise.  In the future, having earphones implanted to the ear canals will be a thing and be much more natural with no more dangling or dealing with the fitting issue.  However, often the complaints would be the lack of bass, sorry to disappoint but you can’t cram those 15” subwoofers to these tiny earbuds.  Overall, I found these earbuds are visually pleasing and work well.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Great but only lasts a few years


These met all my needs in terms sound quality for playing music and functionality for exercising. Battery was okay, it would last a few hours if I played music nonstop. I bought these at the end of 2017, it's been 4 years of usage here and there, and these are starting to fail now. Last week suddenly, I started having connectivity issues where the earbuds refused to connect to my phone and kept disconnecting. I am still unable to properly connect to bluetooth and use these at all. I would rate these 5 stars overall, but knocked down a star because they are no longer usable.

which make very annoying the use of this headphone


I just bought this headphone one week ago and I have used it 2 times and the rewind button does not work. The forward button has no problem but I cannot rewind the song or back to the previous, which make very annoying the use of this headphone.UPDATE: This headphone is very uncomfortable to use, I have to adjust it to my ears all the time. The sound is relatively good but nothing of bass so it is very acute sound.So if you really like good quality sound for your music to motivate you for your workout or running. Do not buy this.Again, The rewind button stop working after the second use.

Luck of the Draw


I bought a pair of these 6mo ago & I love them, 5stars!!  So I bought a 2nd set as back up. The 2nd set, although they look EXACTLY like the 1st set, purchased from the EXACT same seller.  They're just a cheap and inferior knock off of the set I bought originally.The quality of the material is cheap, my guess is they won't last very long.The sound quality isn't even close the other set.It is very difficult to plug them into a charger. (1st set, very smooth & easy. And works with other chargers)Constantly slip off my head when I'm active ( really annoying) (( 1st set hardly ever slips off))So it seems like Luck of the Draw with this product.  If you get a good one, you'll be happy with it.  If you get a cheapy version, you'll probably return it.  Good Luck!

Solid, well-made, good quality sound


Best feature - Adjustable shape ear loops. The little loops that hook around your ears are adjustable rubber, so you can bend/mold them to your ear/head. Some headphones have stiff loops that point inward and dig into my head a little bit, giving me a headache after a few hours. Not these. Soft rubber loops perfect for any head shape or size.Decent quality sound, battery lasts a long time. Wear them for 8+ hours at work, then the gym afterwards. I charge in my car to/from work, no problems with battery dying on me yet. Takes an hour or 2 to charge to 100%, but I've found that's pretty standard time for these things.They're not noise reducing, but what earbud is?

Good wireless bluetooth earphones- great bass!


These wireless headphones met my expectations for a rather inexpensive set.  I was sick of wearing headphones with a wire at work. I would forget to take them off before I got up and I would rip them out of my ears by standing.  If I dropped something and tried to pick it up I would forget the cord wasn't long enough and would rip them out of my ears... so I did an Amazon search for wireless headphones.  What a difference! The sound quality is very good, bass is great, the battery lasts about 6 or 7 hours.  They came with different size ear attachments (whatever you call them) which was nice.  The only real downfall I have found is if you have smaller ears like I do, after a few hours of use, my ear starts to hurt because the outer edge of the earphone is a bit large and it hits a spot on my ear and I have to take them off for a while.  Other than that I think they are great earphones for the price.

Perfect for working out


Great sound quality. Only complaint is that they're too loud... as in, the lowest volume level is too loud to use these at my desk. They're not noise canceling, but they definitely drown out a lot of background noise, so these are way too loud in a cubicle setting. Nevertheless, I bought them for working out so the volume is perfect for that and it's helpful that they're water resistant. Been using for about a month and no issues at all. Battery life is great. Have only needed to charge them twice, although they're only on for about an hour a day, 5x a week. I highly recommend. Fully charged and ready to use right out of the box.

Better then SKULL CANDY, JVC and BEATS


I bought these out of desperation looking for a functional wireless Bluetooth in ear headset to work out with. I have had the skull candy  and JVC wireless version and they both have major flaws. JVC will power off, pause or skip to the next song while working out if you have the slightest moisture touching it. I bought 2 skull candy because the first one only powered on one time and didn’t work afterwards. Won’t even charge really big disappointment. So I bought these and I’m impressed! Reason I always fall back to the skullcandy brand is the bass and these are louder and have more bass then skullcandy! Oh and I didn’t even want to comment of beats as I feel they are the most mediocre of all brands. I dare anyone to go into Best Buy and just compare all brands before purchasing any headset. Skull candy always blows the competition away except the wireless version has a lot of issues:(

Not sweatproof


These are not sweatproof. I used these when outside mowing the lawn and doing yard work (I live in FL and it’s summer). I also used them when I work out. I work out hard and sweat a lot. They worked the first 10 times or so, but now they continually cut off (with a full battery) and won’t turn back on until they’ve dried out. I bought these as a cheaper alternative to the Plantronics Backbeat Fit earphones that I had previously (which died after a few years). I bought these in July; it’s only September and they’re already malfunctioning. Spend the extra $25 on the Plantronics earphones. Superior sound and actually sweatproof!

Good for the price paid.


When I received it, the seal of headphone package was broken. Amazon packing was good.I bought this product for its great rating. But it is not that upto the mark. There are few issues:1. The left ear piece sound fades away as soon as I push it inside the ear canal. Right earpiece is fine.2. The sound is more bassy. Controlling treble is not possible.Apart from that, the design is good, the buttons, functionality and connectivity is all good. I used it while work out and it did not fell apart.I just wish that the sound was more crispier and left earpiece would work correctly.Update~~~~~~Tried the smallest silicone earpiece and now the left earpiece seems functional. Medium and large silicone earpieces don’t work. Bass still too high. No way to control the equalizer.

These earbuds are great. The sound quality is really clear


I rarely write reviews and I really should since I rely on them. These earbuds are great. The sound quality is really clear. The fit is good. I have small ears and have a hard time with earbuds but these work well. Granted the over the ear hook doesn't offer *that* much assistance. Meaning if I had to rely solely on that, it would not fit. However the buds stay in well. I use them to work out and I do a lot of HIIT, Plyo, running, and weight lifting.  These have been very good. I've used them for 3 training sessions (roughly 1 1/2 hours each) and the battery is still on ""very high.""  They pair well with my galaxy s9.  I own 4 pair of earbuds trying to find the right ones. These are it.

The first couple of weeks were great, no disconnectivity


Works when it wants to. I have had these for a little over two months now and so far it's been okay. The first couple of weeks were great, no disconnectivity, clear sound, great battery, etc. all the positive stuff you read here. But after the break in period, man are they pretty annoying at times. They require a restart after turning them on, why? Well once they pair initially I know that if I start listening to music I will be stuck having it drop connection from my phone that is literally in my hand or sitting on my desk in front of me. Then it's nothing but ""connecting"" music ""connecting"" music "" connecting"". I bought them to work out and don't want to use my higher quality headphones (Bowers & Wilkins and Seinnheisers) to go workout. Might just fork up more money just for better quality headphones.But they sound great when they do want to work! I'm just tired of it restarting.

Edit 3/29/2017


When I started hunting for headphones I needed something cheap to use while running as well as watching movies without disturbing my dormmates. These headphones not only surprised my, but blew me away. They originally caught my eye because of all the reviews, but there's so much more to be excited about!1) The came super fast, but I don't know if that's just because of prime, but always an upside, I got to use them less than 12 hours after I ordered them.2) the packaging was nice. It came in a professional box that boasted quality. It was actually so nice I'm not sure I want to throw it away quite yet.3) Upon opening I was happy to find the case, an Android/iPhone cord (i know! Awesome! It can charge both!!), and a car charger! All seem pretty nice, but WAY nicer than what I was expecting. The case is small, and holds the headphones and their charger well. (it could probably fit the phone charger too)4) the headphones are good for the price, not even taking into account all the goodies. After receiving it I was just itching to write a review! What a pleasant surprise!**********EDIT**********Whelp. As much as I didn't want it to be true, all the 1 star reviews ended up being right. Even thought they look perfect, the started to fail. First, the reception on the ear buds got worse. I started to notice it when I would leave my phone on the dresser and pay in bed listening to something; it would start to break up if my body was between the phone and the right earbud. I didn't think much of it at first, I'm pretty easy going after all. However, it got worse and worse until I couldn't even leave the phone in my pocket because it would start to break up. Now I can't get it to play music without my phone being less than a couple feet away and with nothing in between. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the left earbud gave out, refusing to even squeak any sound.Basically, if you're reviewing the reviews for these headphones just know that the one star reviews are true. They work for a couple months then they just stop working completely.

Good deal and worth trying


These work as described, have good controls on them for volume, pause/play and skipping tracks.  They are comfortable to wear but like all these types of headphones take a minute to put on right.  The only issue I have is they don't sounds very good unless you really get them in your ear snuggly.  Now, everyone has different sized ear canals but I used the smallest rubber ear pieces they provided and I still have difficulty getting them situated right.  That could just be me ear holes, your results may vary.  If you don't get them in their sug, they sounds rather tinny.  Get them in right and it makes a big difference.  For $30 with the case and the magnetic phone holder for your car, it's a very good deal.

Not worth it despite the low price


Despite the low pirce, I don't think these are worth it for the following reasons1) Super annoying, loud, and robotic 'battery low' warning which triggers at 30% battery and goes on until it dies which is about 1 hr.  There's no way to turn this off2) Battery is weird.  Goes from 70% to 30% in an hour or less.3) Poor batter life overall.  Definitely not 8 hours, especially if you don't count that annoying 'battery low' period.4) Constantly hearing staticSound is good when it does work and fit is comfortable.  But what good is that if it only works for much less than the advertised time battery life.  Back to my search for the best bluetooth headphones.  Sigh...

Very Impressed


I purchased mine based on the Amazon reviews. Everything looked good.However the one I received had an issue. I sent the seller an email and  I got a reply back in less than an hour. They certainly wanted to help and provided a suggestion on how to resolve the problem. The next day I tried, and it didn't work.Sent another email, and again, less than an hour for a reply. They let me know another was on its way.  In a few days I had a new working unit.So it's great when the product works, but I think it says a lot more when the seller is so invested in making things right. 6 Stars.

I'm still working at getting these to fit comfortably. They are bigger than I normally have and ...


First let me say I got these to use in the pool.  Swimming laps and doing Aquacise classes. These headphones have the highest rating for water proof ability. I'm still working at getting these to fit comfortably. They are bigger than I normally have and don't stay in my ear very well. However, they do work as long as your head is above water and you are in range of the Bluetooth device. Instructions don't go into great detail but you get the basics. One side has all the controls and I have a hard time with them. Anyone with large hands and fingers would find it very difficult as the buttons are close and it is easy to hit two at the same time. While I am not thrilled with the design of these headphones especially for use in a pool, they do work.

SENSO Bluetooth Headphones


This SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are great. It only took seconds to connect to my IPhone 6 and the sound quality is great. I use it while weight training and running. It doesn't need constant adjust while exercising. The ear buds stay put thanks the ear piece and the hook that goes behind your ears. It took a little getting use to the controls being up on the ear piece instead of on the cord, but I set my volume and music playlist before I begin my workout. It also includes two small wire ties you can install on the cord to secure it under your chin or behind your neck. The car charger is convenient just in case I forget to charge the headphones over night and it has two USB so you can charge your phone at the same time. I've only had this headphone for about a week so if anything changes I'll update my review.

Best I've owned!


Comfort. The fit. The sound. Battery life. These are the four primary reason why I love these headphones.  I have several other bluetooth headphones and this pair is the best. They are very comfortable to wear and fit perfectly. I feel the controls are very intuitively placed and very easily accessible. Most of all, I love the fact that it will last hours and hours on a single charge. This is imperative for me while biking or kayaking. The only minor issue I have at this time is that the cable seems a bit stiff. It is not as soft and flexible as others I have but this could be because they are brand new and haven't had time to lose the memory from being tightly coiled for shipment.

Incredible  Quality -Awesome Accessories


Update:  Battery life is great- didn't use it for a couple days and battery life still good.  When using headset icon shows battery life on iphone.  When powering on/off voice says power on/off and says connected or disconnected immediately.  Bluetooth connection is fast.  Very pleased with my purchase.Amazing headphones!  This is my 4th purchase of bluetooth wireless headphones. I finally found one that does not disappoint me.  Senso is the best!The sound is incredible.  Easy to pair, being able to change music tracks is easy to do!  Blown away by what was included in the purchase.  The hard case comes in handy.  No need to worry how I am going to keep it from getting lost or damaged.  Great for exercising at the gym or outdoors.  I sweat a lot - Senso is ideal for me.So happy I purchased these.

Worked great... for awhile


I bought two pair of these in September of 2017, one for me and one for my wife.  We both loved the sound quality but both of us had issues with the fit, for me, the left ear bud would always slip, the right was great.  Recently, however, the volume/skip buttons on my wife's set fell out.  They still work, she just can't change volume or song from the earbud.  Mine won't charge.  I have tried several different cords but nothing works.  The battery died and there is nothing I can do.  They were pretty reasonable but for $30ish I would like them to last a few years more.

Nice product and I am happy with it so far.


So far- so good.  I used them this morning during my exercise routine.  They fit well and stay on my ears. I like them, they are very light weight and easy to use, I didn't even know I had them on after awhile. I like the controls and being able to answer my iPhone while in use.  Also, they automatically sync with my IPhone when I turn them on and I don't have to reconnect every time to bluetooth, just turn on and I can play my music.  Don't expect them to sound like your stereo at home but they have good sound.  Cable is very flexible. Instructions were clear but very tiny print, I had to get out my magnifying glass to read it.  Took me awhile to figure out that the Dual Port Charging cable didn't really apply to the product but the auto adapter and cable are a nice extra that I have put in my glove box.  I charged them before using, lets see how long a charge lasts now.

Amazing sound for earbuds that aren't outrageously expensive.


I do not think I have yet to leave feedback on any of the products I have bought before. I am not good with proper reviews.I don't spend much on headphones because they seem to break on me easily. They either last long but lose their good quality sound. Or have good quality sound but develop a short in the cord after less than 6. The pair I replaced with these broke in less than a week they were a different brand. Sadly they had a amazing sound as well.The sound from these is amazing. All the sounds are audible. Sometimes I think I hear outside noise but then I realize it’s from what I’m listening to that I never heard before. Speaking of that with other headphones sounds around me get distorted normal sounds can sound like someone calling my name and sometimes I hear knocks on my door and someone opening it. At the present with these it hasn’t happened. *crosses fingers.*What I love the most is it is helping me enjoy my favorite video game again. I played it one time with a good surround sound system and it was so immersive and after that it was as fun without the pretty sounds. But with these headphones I can hear the pretty sounds a lot clearer now I am enjoying it more again..Music sounds amazing as well. It had the right amount of base so it doesn’t trigger my bass intolerance. I can here the booms and still hear the singing. Other headphones with good quality sound the bass can sound off.So far the quality says it’s worth a higher price.I just hope they don’t poop out like all my other headphones.

Blown Away by these


I have bad hearing in one ear so all the reviews that said the sound quality was excellent didn't really phase me. I do like good bass and the fact that it is waterproof, so I bought them. As soon as I listened to music on these, I was blown away by the quality of the sound. I was really impressed by the fullness and richness of the music. I found them very comfortable once I switched out the earbuds to the foam orange ones. Time will tell on how they perform with sweat and activity, but I feel sure I will still love them. I like the positioning of the control buttons. The only thing I worry about is wearing them in bed and inadvertently powering them off. Oh well, we'll see. Highly recommend!!

You MUST swap out the ear tips to the foam ones!!!


I’m a musician (a bass player).  When I got these, I started with the plastic eartips that come already on the ear buds.  The sound had WAY much bass.  It overpowered the music and I was really disappointed.  Someone said on another review to swap out the eartips with the foam ones that come with the ear buds so I gave it a try.  WOW!  Fixed the sound instantly!  I have had other earbuds that have the plastic eartips like these come with and the sound is fine.  Not sure why these plastic ones suck but TRUST ME, swap them out.  The sound quality on these with the foam tips is INCREDIBLE!  My only thought is that the plastic tips somehow muffle the sound and create more bass.

Sound quality is really good, and they stay in the ears during activities. Volume output is impressive.  The power button is easy to use as a play / pause too. The volume controls are really small, takes some getting used to operate them.  I recommend these connected wireless earbuds, and I’ll likely buy a 2nd set just for backup.

Best ear phones!


Love love love this headphones! I originally wanted completely wireless but after buying a pair that's battery wouldn't last more than 2 uses I ordered my second pair of headphones and scored these bad boys. Battery lasts for at least 7-10 days. Super easy to use. Easy to connect and turn on and off. When u have the ear buds in it tells you that it is powering on or off so you don't accidentally leave them on.  They come with a hard case which makes them easy to keep up with as well and multiple cords for charging. I move and jump around alot while working out and they don't fall out. Wish it would have been my first choice so I wouldn't have wasted $25 in the beginning. Amazon's top pick is always right.  ✔

Best for outdoor running..


One of the best investments .. I had a lot of trouble finding right headphones for workout, especially running. When you run for 2 hrs+, you need one is comfortable, that doesn't keep coming off or hurt your ear. My past headsets would start slipping, have to change the ear foam ($6-20) after few months, can't use in rain, etc. All of these are now things of the past..Senso gave bunch of additional things in the package (2 charging cables, 2 slot 2.1A car charger) which is nice and adds value. But the headphones alone is worth the money.Sound if ofcourse is great. I'm not looking to hear audiophile quality music. It works great & battery lasts for several hours. I run 5 hrs a week & charge it once a week.

Peace of Mind with my purchase. Really Impressed with Company


I am glad to report an interesting review. This company is great. They have terrific service and a great product. The reason it's an interesting review is that my headphones actually failed in about 40 days of use, but this is what makes my other comment about a great company so meaningful. I had registered the product with their warranty information that they had provided when I received the headphones, they made the registration very easy and very informative. Then when I was surprised that I needed to contact them about the headphones, they also made that very easy. They told me my product was still under warranty and apologized and said not to worry. They confirmed some information through email and are sending me a replacement pair, and I've become very impressed with the company. I highly recommend doing business with them and based on my experience would have peace of mind that they are in your corner for the long run.As for the headphones, they are comfortable and wear well, with a nice travel case. They are convenient and have a good sound.

For the price these wireless headphones are fantastic. I've tried EVERY single brand under $30 and these are the best. You can tell just by feeling these ear buds the quality is much higher then other cheap brands. The sound quality and noise cancelation is also considerably better. I would buy these ear buds before any other brand under $50 no doubt about it. Also BONUS they include a magnetic car vent mounted cell phone holder in the box! Works great! Those sell for $15 alone! Buy these ear buds people, dont waste your money on other brands.

Worked great for a while


These worked really well for almost 1.5 years. I could hear the quality of calls and music well. I was told that sometimes background noise was picked up too much, but that’s most headphones anyway.After a year, I would connect to my phone for a call but then they would disconnect without saying “disconnected”. I thought it was something with the phone updates until today. Today I was told “power on, connected” but then the phone couldn’t find them. I tried turning them off and trying again. Every time the headphones would say power on, connected. Never power off or disconnected. I had just charged them so dead battery.

good volume and price but wont stay in the ear


Bought these about 2 weeks ago to replace the powerBeats 2 ear buds since they would no longer hold a charge. The price for these was very good. So I though I would try them even though there was some concern on reviews as to the floppy ear holder. I run 10 to 20 miles a on a treadmill. I watch TV to pass the time. I needed ear phones that would be loud enough to hear over the noise of the treadmill. I would give these head phones 5 Starts for their volume. I love the controls. I have only charged them once and after 6 hours of running they are still loud and clear.  They are much clearer and louder then the PowerBeats 2 that I replaced. Again I would give them a 5 for clarity. Unfortunately, the ear wrap is so weak that these will not stay in my ear. The PowerBeats ear warp is much stouter then the SENSO, however, neither of these are ideal for my ears. I guess I have different ears ten anyone else on the planet. Ear buds do not stay in my ears. Once I started sweating, the Senso drop out of my ears in maybe 10 steps. So disappointing that the ear wrap does not have the ability to be shaped/bent to fit my ear. To correct this issue I had to tape a thin wire made from a cheap dry cleaner hanger to the Senso. With the wire, the ear wrap is now moldable/bendable and fits my ear so the buds are more stable in my ear. Wish that the folks at SENSO were athletes  and knew that the ear wrap is just too flimsy if you are doing any activity

Does what headphones need to do. Just don't trust all the bells and whistles.


Headphones mostly work as expected. They do all the things headphones need to do.I have two gripes though. First, when you sync it with your phone or tablet, it sends back battery information, which gets displayed on your phone. Don't trust that number. Mine said 90% until it decided it had low batteries. Then it said 30% until it turned itself off.Second, it said in the manual that you can have it sync to multiple devices at the same time, but can only play from one. This is true. However, some devices apparently play back silence instead of nothing. This causes the audio to be garbled from the device you were trying to listen to and causes it to switch back and forth to each device and beep in your ear when that happens. At first glance, it seems like connectivity issues, but I fixed it by turning off Bluetooth on the device I wasn't using.Also comes with a nice case and a nice box for keeping the charger, manual, extra ear buds, car magnet thing, etc.

Went through the washing machine, and.....


Worked great! These have worked well from day 1. Never a problem connecting and I appreciate the message in my ear when I turn them on and I am told they are 'on' and 'connected'. With my Sony Bluetooth I have to ask Alexa what the hell time it is just to find out if the damn speaker is connected. Well done Sony. Anyway, these little suckers always work. I have to admit that I do not use any of the features with the controls on the unit (volume, and answer the phone, I think). The bottom line for me is that the buttons are too small and the juice isn't worth the squeeze. I use these in the gym, while cycling, and on my stationary bike. I recommend these, especially for the price.

Fit is excellent, the ear hooks bend easily and fit perfectly and are very comfortable., the extra ear pads included help to customize the fit.

Senso Wireless Bluetooth Headphones


Purchased 2 sets of wireless Bluetooth Senso headphones for 2 young men that take care and maintain 37 acres.  They work out doors all year long in every kind of weather.  They needed tough durable hard working men headphones. Both young men are amazed at the clear quality of the music they are listening to.  They both said the noise canceling works as they are mowing and edging acres of lawn.  So far they seem extremely pleased with their new headphones.  It was a pleasure to gift the headphones to these 2 extremely hard working young men.  Thank you.  It was a fun high quality listening enjoyable gift to give to acknowledge these two hard working individuals.

Nice ear buds with useful accessories


These headphone are working exactly as expected.  I don't use them for exercise but I do use them so that I can listen to audio books and videos while I work around the house.  I previously used a one-ear bud for listening, but the sound is much better with these and they fit more securely in my ears.  I will say that these are not petite earbuds.  Each piece is a good size.  I do wonder if the over-ear piece is even necessary because it does not really tuck snugly above my ear.  It seems like the product could do without it.  But these are comfortable and the sound meets my expectations.  It's nice that a dual car charger is included along with a cord that can be used to charge either my earbuds or my iPhone, and the case will make it easier to keep the earbuds in my purse.

Fake review caused an unfortunate purchase


The headphones are uncomfortable to wear and stopped working in less than a month. When then i bought these headphones they were the number 1 wireless headphones selling on amazon with thousands of 5 star reviews... it is not as highly rated now. I went to best buy and i bought a pair of sony WC3000 set of headphones and have been wearing them nearly every day since. I even washed the WC3000 and can still use them. I guess the lesson here is that the amazon ratings mean absolutely nothing and going with a name brand you can trust in MUCH more important.

Excellent accessory for the price!!!


I went to a locally ""box"" store to purchase replacement wireless Bluetooth headset, and came out empty handed as they were too expensive for me in my opinion. Met a friend for a meal, and he told me about SENSO ActivBuds, he sent me a direct link on Amazon, I reviewed them, liked what I read and price, and purchased them on the spot. Oh what a wonderful joy when I received them!!!. I put them on charger, but they we're almost fully charged and ready to connect to my device. First test is music - EXCELLENT is all I can say. These were just as good as my plug in in earbuds. Second test phone call - again EXCELLENT I had to turn volume down as clarity was very good.All I can say is if you're not into advertised and overpriced accessories for your hearing pleasure, these are a true treasure.

Could be better


Update Aug, 2019: After a little more than 2 years of use, left earbud started to fail. Looks like the cord is breaking and generating bad contact. End of product life...The sound quality is not the best, but it's okay. The earphone doesn't fall from my ear while exercising which is good. I am satisfied with the battery duration. The two points I didn't like are:- it's common to have some breaks while listening to my cellphone's media. It's not a problem with the cellphone, but I don't have breaks while using a Bluetooth speaker. So, I assume the earphone reception is not very good.- the warning of low battery should start earlier. When the first warning starts, it means you will probably have about 5 minutes of listening remaining.Overall I do not regret the purchase, but it was my first Bluetooth earphone, so I don't have other opinions to compare.

Very well built


For this price, these are probably the best earbuds that you can buy. It's even better than some earbuds that I bought at a $40 price. The sound quality is very good, especially at this low price. What makes these stand out is the quality of design. The over-ear rubber doesn't just flap about uselessly and it's not too hard. You can literally bend them to the shape of your ear or however you want them to be shaped. I've bought several other brands of earbuds, and none of them deliver on the build quality that these have, especially the fit on my ear.

They hit the $30 wireless headphones price point expectations


I bought these to decide if I liked wireless headphones before jumping into an expensive set. Overall they are okay with one drawback. If I am walking around with my phone in my pants pocket they start cutting out. I didn't expect the range to be amazing but that is flat out annoying.Audio quality is actually decent. Not audio snob level but not $5 headphone level either.I have used them for phone calls a few times and they work well, I can hear the person I am talking to and they can hear me without the need to shout.Whoever Senso is they spent some money on packaging. I expected cheap packaging but this came in a nice case with a decent USB cable, and an expensive feeling box (there are probably other things that I pitched with the box and case).Overall they are about what I would expect from $30 wireless headphones.

Excellent Quality, Stays in Ears


I have never had a set of headphones of the in-ear type that would actually stay in my ears without slowly wiggling out, but this pair does! I love the sleek design, the hard shell carrying case that comes in the box, and the overall quality of this product. The sound is quite loud, I've never had my volume up above 50%. The headphones do seem to be a bit heavy on the bass side, though I could easily correct this by downloading an audio equalizer app. The only thing that bugs me a little about it is the orientation of the volume +/- buttons. The - button is facing forward, when I intuitively think that forward would be +. It just took a little getting used to. But I love these headphones!

Charging cable stopped working


Edit 3/9: After Senso support reached out, I tried using a different cable and it started charging - so it was the cable, not the headphones, that was at fault. The charging cable was also heating up, so definitely needs to be replaced.They seem ok for the price, but did not expect them to stop working so soon! In less than 3 months of intermittent usage they have now stopped charging. When I plug them in to charge, the red/blue light does not come up and even after keeping them plugged in for couple hours it's always saying ""battery low""! Completely useless. And of course Amazon will not take it back as it's been over a month, but come on.. less than 3 months is too short of a life for headphones - I'd expect at least a year.

Great value headphones, just not good for running outside.


The sound quality and overall features are good. A very solid value for the money. That said, I purchased these to use while running as I listen to music and audio books, podcasts, etc. If there's even a slight wind, the design of these headphones cause an almost unbearable wind shear sound. This sound is not slight. It drowns out the sound completely. Now if there's no wind, or the wind is with you, the headphones are great. For me, that's a two star. If you're just using them around the house/office, or in a gym, they're a great value. Outside though, not so great. UPDATE: I've tried all of the different ear pieces that come with the package and all of them have the horrible wind sound. Unusable outside. I'm moving on from these.

Great, long life earbuds!


Fantastic wireless ear buds. The sound quality is great, and I reccommend the red foam buds that come in the set. They last for hours, and have good range. I haven't actually worn them long enough in any one use to kill the battery, but I'd say they have at least 8 hours battery life, if not more. The adjustable ear cuff is also pretty great, but it is a bit fiddly especially if you have more hair, or put your hair up.They are super obvious, and may not be good for work if you need something more discreet.

Disappointing, Not Quality Reviews Suggest


I've got to say, I trusted most of the great reviews for this product, but I am very unimpressed with them. Here's why:1- Earbud material actually becomes uncomfortable as it rubs against your ear. I tried putting felt pads on them to eliminate the issue, but product should be made of a softer material. Ear holders wraps are soft but easily slip off if you're moving on an elliptical or treadmill and actually working up a sweat or wearing a hat.2- Sound quality is not impressive, earphones usually distort at normal volumes or simply don't have a strong Bluetooth connection.3- Battery life is not as advertised. I end up having to charge these after approx 2 hours of use.Wanted to live these, but they don't live up to the hype with my experience.

The best cost-benefit ratio I could find


Wow, this an outstanding product. I'm a Bose fan and I've been using Bose wired Soundsport  for years during running activities. Two years ago I decided to go wireless but Bose wireless was bulky and I was afraid on losing it since the fixation to ears is internal. So I gave a chance to Beats Powerbeats2. What a deception. After running with them for some time, button for turning it on & off started to fail, probably due to sweat. Since after a while it would come back working again I didn't ask for warranty. A year and a month later, the buttons/mic cover felt apart. It was $ 200.00 in the trash. Well, not all that amount because I used it for a year, but it should last longer.I bought the Senso Bluetooth to my son at same time. At that time I thought a cheaper one would cover his needs, since he's teenager and loses his stuffs very frequently. Well, his phones are working perfectly, even more if we consider a teenager using them. So I made my decision and bought same product to me and I can assure that it is worth every penny spent on them.Pros: price, sound, building quality, lightness, battery life, accessories sent in the packageCons: no Siri access from headphone buttons.It's the best cost-benefit ratio I could find. If during my usage they last more than a year, I would be happy with my purchase and will go for them again in case they fail.

I am not sure who is giving this product 5 ...


I am not sure who is giving this product 5 star ratings but i am not one of them. These headphones are uncomfortable and i am trying to listen and charge at the same time via usb and it can't even handle that.  I've never had headphones that consumed more power than they drew, but apparently these do. These headphones are currently plugged into my computer and dying as I listen to music.  Very strange to me and I will not purchase again.  To boast 8 hours of playtime is a jokeMy phone last well past 8 hours and does way more.  They also don't play very loud. Bought these on recommendation by Amazon and not at all impressed. Stay away.

Get what you pay for


Finally decided to give up on these headphones.  Unless you are indoors and seated with your phone out of your pocket-- you will not get a good connection.While working outdoors with the paired phone in my back pocket-- bend over to pick something up-- lost the signal and sounds like a distorted call.  Leave it out of the pocket and bend over--same thing.I'll be going to Costco to buy a replacement for these that I can truly count on-- done with this brand and done buying cheap junk from Amazon.

Great quality! Don't let the price make you think they're cheap!!


Wow! I can't believe the quality for the price. Super impressed. The ear hooks are nice and moldable to your ears, the soft silicone blocks outside noise, and the sound quality is great. I did a lot of research before ordering and then I was down to just a couple and I decided to go with these, I am so glad I did! Haven't had them long enough to test playtime or durability. Hope they last. Update, have had them several months now. Still working perfectly. Charge is nice. Sometimes I don't use them for weeks, go turn them on and wear them for a few hours just fine.

Absolutely love these headphones


Absolutely love these headphones. I was a little skeptical at first about the ear piece, but once I received them I realized they didn't fall off. I wear these while working out, if you see me don't talk to me because I won't be able to hear you with them on :) I love the sound quality also. Trying to get my husband to convert.Had to get a new pair of these since I lost them while moving. The news ones are made different. The material appears more durable and the flap that goes around the ear actually stays put this time. I love them. Only con is the charging cable that comes with it doesn't fit at all into the port. I have to use my cell charger to charger them. Otherwise, they are great, sound is impeccable.

Sweat-proof but not for cycling


These are really great little wireless earbuds, and I wanted to really like them.Pros:- Long battery life, long standby time, quick and fast charge- No problems with fit, multiple pieces are provided by Senso so you can adjust them to get a good fit- Comes with a combo (USB and USB-C) style charging cable, and an additional USB charging cable (don't remember the last time a company included 2 different charging cables with their product).- Definitely sweat-proof - just remember not to charge them right after a workout, instead let them dry out before charging them.My primary reason to buy wireless earbuds is for outdoor cycling, and for that purpose the product under delivers.Cons:- At speeds greater than 20 miles / hour, you get wind noise (and even though I tried to get used to it, it bothered me even after 5 rides)- Phone is in my pocket while cycling (approx. 3 feet away from earbuds), and it kept dropping connection (this really gets annoying). Initially I thought it might be due to streaming, but the connection issue remained even while listening to offline music.- The connection issue doesn't occur if you are standing still - I'm not sure if it is the phone movement due to spinning crankshaft, or movement of bicycle itself, but the dropouts keep happening.

great for automotive shop use.


I bought these after trying a few different pairs of regular headphones for work. I work in a large open automotive shop and the shop equipment generates constant noise. The wired headphones constantly get snagged and caught on tools or parts of a car. My goal was to find a pair that was relatively cheap and was Bluetooth compatible. these pair of senso headphones were ones i chose out of a few different pairs on amazon. After about 1 week of use I am pretty happy with my purchase. these headphones have no problem lasting through a 9 hour work day and i have plugged them in at the end of the day every night. the Bluetooth range is okay, what i expect any pair of wireless headphones to be, I cant leave the building without it cutting out but easily get a good 40 feet of length before cutting out. the sound quality is okay but not great, which should be expected for any pair of earbuds in the $20 price range. The treble of the sound is great, just the low frequencies seem like they are muffled a bit and you can never really great a good bass from the headphones but the sound overall is clear. the noise-cancelling is the reason why I bought these headphones and I believe that they work great after spending some time to properly adjust the earbuds to your own ears. the comfort of these headphones is okay after taking some time to fit them properly, although I feel that comfort is something that is different for everyone and you would really just have to try them for yourself, they come with 3 different sizes of soft ear tips to get them to fit just right. overall I believe that these earbuds are great for anyone looking to reduce noise in a loud work environment and cannot deal with the extra wires on their person.

Great EVERYDAY bluetooth headphone


I used these headphones EVERYDAY for about 7 months straight.I use them in the gym, going to class, on my bike and skateboard. They sound great, are easy to fit in my pocket, and connect to my phone (OnePlus 5T) really fast. They work well with my iPad too! The main feature I like is the battery life.However after using them for 7 months or so, the right earbud randomly stopped working :(Unlike many other companies, this company stood by their warranty policy and sent me a new pair to me and I got them 4 days after originally contacting them.GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is why even though they did break, they are still getting a 5 star review.

Regret buying these


I liked my last set of headphones of this style,  but I hate these. Even with the biggest size of them, they fall out and off of my ears. The connection is wonky and I have had issues where I couldn’t pair them, but also it was on and refusing to let me restart them. They also travel way too far down the ear and are very uncomfortable. I’m so sad these didn’t work out.

Perfect sound and great battery life


These have been awesome for the price! The battery life is amazing. I use them for about 2 hours 3-5 days per week while at the gym and only charge them maybe every other week; the batteries have only diet on me twice. The sound is clear and even on calls it’s great. No interference noises. I had to change the ear bud to a smaller size, but it came with several, so it wasn’t an issue. The only downside is that the curved part that goes over the ear is quite large for me; I’ve gotten used to it now, but if there was a way to order sized ones, that’s the only suggestion I would have. These are as clear as my beats, but the battery lasts much longer in these!

Great set of Bluetooth headphones, came with different sizes of rubber ear buds and an amazing foam one that keeps the buds in my ear comfortably even when I'm working out or doing chores around the house. Good battery life, could be better but lasts most of the day, and charges quickly. Reach of the Bluetooth is also pretty good, if you stay in the same room as the source device you shouldnt have any problems. The only thing I dont like about these is that during use there is a constant blue flashing light and it is pretty disruptive at night (small piece of electrical tape took care of that problem)

Lasted a good 6 months


I've had my headphones for almost 6months now and they were okay. The sound was pretty good, but I could still hear the wind when I was running outside. And that's okay because after a few minutes I didn't think about the wind anymore and just the music. I never turned them up to full volume because they get very loud. I used them for yard work too. I could get 20ft from my phone before the sound would cut out, and I knew it was time to charge them when the sound would start cutting out 2feet from my phone while running. So after my 6months of use 1-3times a week they died. I did the research to get them to turn back on but they won't. I have never dropped them or tossed or abused them. I expected headphones to last more then 6months for the $37. I think I over paid. I would not repurchase these.

"" Startlingly great sound. Super lightweight


If I could award 4.5, I would ... product is almost ""perfect.""  Startlingly great sound.  Super lightweight.  Very comfortable and easy to secure around the ear.  Only small area for improvement would be to rethink placement of some control functions, they are crowded together over a very small space (in fairness, this keeps the weight of the headset very light) on one ear, making it easy to mistakenly cue one function when trying for another. Even the indicator light is perhaps smaller than it needs to be, making it hard to see.  But on balance, this is a superb product available at a great value -- and the customer service (reached on line) is as outstanding as I've ever experienced.

I love these headphones for working out at the gym! Even when running or jumping whole sweaty they stay in my ears and have the best sound quality I've experienced in a wireless earbud.

Fits comfortably - good sound


Just got them last week, but so far I like them. The fit comfortably and the sound quality is good.I had a pair of Toshiba earphones and the ""control"" mechanism was on the wire in between the left and right earphone and when I ran it would bounce off my neck. Anyway the Senso earphone have the ""control"" mechanism inside the right earphone so it does not bounce off my neck when I run.So after one week, I'm very happy with them. And if they last over a year with almost daily use then I would buy them again.

Surprisingly good!


I was pleasantly surprised by these units. Although the sound quality is not audiophile, the volume capability is substantial, and the Bluetooth connection is stronger than my $500 over-the-ear name brand units. I bought these specifically for use in the hot tub, and while I don't dunk my head, there is a lot of steam and splashing and after a few sessions over the last few weeks, the phones still work fantastically.  I wish there was a little better charging logic, as the user manual recommends to be unplugged after the charge indicator shuts off, and not left charging overnight.  I also have had a couple opportunities to chat on the phone with them in, and while I did have to speak up a bit, I was told my voice sounds crystal clear. Overall, quite a value.

Ear hooks do not fit ... at all.  Falls off my ear.


I Hope this review isn't a duplicate.  These headphones are decent.  I wear them while dancing.  There are several foam tips so they should fit any ears. The button controls are not difficult.  My biggest issue is that the ear hooks are soft ... like silicon.  My ears are very small and lie quite flat to my head and I also wear glasses.  They literally fall off and therefore won't stay on my head.  However, I have devised a work-around.  I tuck the soft hooks between the control box thing (Don't know what it is called) and the ear canal piece and leave it while I'm not wearing it.  It takes a set and seems to work.  I have attached a picture.

Almost a Great Product!


I REALLY want to like this product more.  The sound is good, they fit well, hold a good charge, and connect easily.  But the one main problem I have is with the Bluetooth reception.  It works great as long as the right side headphone has an almost line-of-sight to your transmitter, which in my case is my iPod.  If I put the iPod in my pocket, or my body gets in the way, or I turn away from the iPod sitting out somewhere, there is a brief loss of signal.  It picks right back up once it regains signal and keeps playing, but the constant interruption is maddening.  I may try an arm band for my iPod to see if that helps.  If it were not for this issue, I would give these a 5 star for sure..

Not made for the small eared


I bought this headphones thinking that the hook around the ears would stop them from popping out during my workout.  I couldn't even go for a walk with them in without them falling off.  Very flimsy and loose for people with small ears.  They also kept disconnecting from my phone it I was actually use them.  So if I received a call I would have to put them on hold while I figured out how to get my headset connected.  This was a let down for me.

I purchased 2 sets of these headphones for my daughter and I to use with Aqua Exercise. They don’t pick up Pandora very well. Lots of static. Left bud keeps going out all together on BOTH headsets. Acts like there is a “short” because music goes in and out even with phone close to headset  This happens on BOTH. The piece that slips around ears keeps slipping off and bud doesn’t fit ears properly even with switching bud pieces. Would NOT recommend these. Very disappointed.

Great sound and no video lag!


I bought a set of these 3 years ago and have loved them! They've managed to hold up great over that time even given my less than gentle nature and clumsiness. They've gone through the wash at least 4-5 times too lol. I came back looking to buy a fully wireless set of earphones as the battery life at all those washes and 3 years of daily use is down to a couple of hours. I tried the Pasonomi x9... What a dissappointment absolutely terrible sound tinny, no bass, none of the tips were comfortable or gave a good seal. I put the tips from these Senso's on and they were comfortable but still terrible sound and very noticeable lag, despite being bluetooth 5.0, while trying to watch video. So if they sound terrible then why listen to music, and if they lag you can't even use them for video. Which brings me back here to order another set of these for $30 less and with 3 year old tech that sound and work better! Anyone know if there's an updated version of these?

Great sound, terrible connection.


First off let me say this was a pretty difficult review to write since I have mixed feelings on this product.  Let me just start out by saying that these headphones sound great, feel great, and charge fast.  One of the best headphones for deep bass and full sound.  When I first tried them I was amazed at the sound for the price and couldn't wait to take them for a jog.  But here's the knock, when I put my Pixel 2 in my pocket to jog, the sound kept cutting in and out.  I quickly called customer support and they told me other than defaulting them there was nothing more I could do, so I returned them.  After seeing all the high reviews I was very disappointed.

Great purchase


Absolutely the best sounding headphones I've ever used. Bass very strong and highs clear, these have, along with an equalizer, brought me new clarity to my listening.I've had no problem with durability. Lots of outside bicycle riding, hours each day, rain and shine with no issues.Totally satisfied.UPDATE: A pair of these, out of two owned, have just quit working three and a half months in. No response, no lights, no charge, no nothing. Really sorry about this because these are hands down the best inexpensive headphones I've used. We will buy another set they're just that good. The other set, much older, much harder used, still works fine so maybe a sun flare hit the dead ones, who knows.

Hear it clearly.


These are great headphones, they do exactly what they say they will. In one example, I used them in a very noisy area to watch a video on my phone. The audio came in clear and sharp, the outside ambient noise still came in but very soft in volume. The ear hooks come in useful to securely hold the headphones, and the gel-like buds fit comfortably in the ear canal. As far as battery life, I haven't used them enough to know how long power would last, but I have never run out of power after using them again after not charging for a long time (a month or so).

Great product and nice to have a wire free device


I received the box sometime. Great Packaging. Not a lot of waste and no plastic to have to cut through. After opening the box I found everything that was supposed to be included. Not quite sure what the longer cord is used for as it seems that it is useless with the device as there's nowhere to plug that cord into the device for charging purposes. The device seems to work as stated. I think possibly the cord could be just a slightly bit longer as I did notice while biking and turning to look left and right the court would seem to need to be a bit longer so as to not bind and pull the plugs from the ears. I think it might help to have the multi-purpose button raised a bit which makes it easier to find. I may need to play with the ear inserts as the sound was not nearly as nice or loud while biking as my wired set of earbuds I have been using. Wind noise was a major factor when biking using these earbuds. Would have received five stars had the sound been better.

I love it


I love these head phones. I use them every day. I wish the cord was a little longer because my neck rubs on it an since it's rubber it pulls the headphones. I just wear the cord in front and it's fine. It's loud enough to hear when I mow. I think the battery last a long time. I probably listen to them an hour a day and only have to charge it once a week. It starts to beep when the battery is about to die. You don't have very long after that before it's dead. I also use it to talk on the phone. I didn't purchase if for that reason but it's a great bonus. Another thing I like is that you can pause your audio on your phone by just clicking the button on the ear piece.

Looks great, sound quality is disappointing


This is a classic example of a very nicely designed and marketed Chinese product which cuts corners in the most important area - in this case, sound quality.Pros:-Nicely Designed-Decent fit & finishCons:Sound quality leaves much to be desired.  The primary job of headphones is reproducing quality sound.  I don't expect too much out of $40 headphones, but these are just awful.  Seriously.  I have $5 wired headphones which sound WAY better than these.  I also have $20 bluetooth earbuds which are WAY better.My advise for the manufacture, is to put a little more effort into the primary function of the headphones, namely spend a little more on the drivers and a little less on the bundled gadgets.

Pretty durable


Have had mine for 1 1/2 years last week after a 3hrs bike ride I forgot that they were placed in my back jersey  pocket and they went into the washer....after two days of drying I put them on thinking that they were cooked but they played with no base. I let them dry for another day and the base came back they are functioning normal now. The only caveat I have is be careful when charging make sure you don't bend the cord back too far as it's pretty close to the charging port and you can create a short that can cut out the left speaker, this happened with a previous unit several years ago,

Amazing user interface.


I have a pair of powerbeats 3. I prefer to use these over those because it has such a good user interface. I can actually know when I have a low battery and it's nice to know when It's conected. The ability to hold the volume button to change the song is really nice because I don't need to take my phone out of my pocket. I work outdoors as a grounds keeper. I've warn these in the rain a they work great because they are water proof. The case with new tips and a small power cord is really nice. It also came with a iPhone/micro USB cable and a USB car plug. All for an amazing price. I actually would pay more for it if I ever had to replace them. Daily user

Great things come in small packages!


Ordered two sets of these and they turned out to be much better quality than anticipated. Set up was not as intuitive as you would think and forced me to consult the directions but once I got them going they spent an hour with me on the treadmill streaming videos from my android phone.No drop out the entire time in use.  Bass response for their size was good, but of course not as good as full ear covering headphones as you would expect, but audio is crisp and speech very intelligible.The extra accessories supplied kept me from looking for things to make it work, everything needed is in the box with a nice carry case, I like that!.A side note other things that produce blue tooth signals do interfere with setup and you should move to a blue-tooth dead area for an easier set-up experience.

Very decent head phones for the price!


Just received my set of headphones and I'm pretty happy though I can't speak for long term reliability yet. That said they come with a year's warranty so I'm not worried. The headphones come with two charging cables, three sets of silicon buds in different sizes, and two dongles to adjust the cable which sits behind your neck. Oh and it all comes with a vehicle USB charger and carry case. I needed the small buds and with the dongle on the cable adjusted to fit around my neck they were much more stable while running. Not the most comfortable I've ever worn but these are half the price too. Sound is perfectly adequate for their price point and purpose, plenty of volume but don't drown out sounds around me. This is important if you're using them while out exercising. All in all I think it's great value for under $30.

Excellent Bluetooth Headphones


One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. Comfortable, great sound, surprisingly long battery life. They stay on with no problem while exercising. They even come with a nice little zip up hard case for storage. Sometimes connecting them to my iPhone can be a little tricky, but nothing that can't be fixed with a quick switch of Bluetooth on and off. Highly recommended.Edit: Just wanted to add that you can also pause, adjust volume, and even skip forward/backward (used on Spotify) with the buttons right on the headphones. I believe they have other functionality that I've yet to use, as well. Very convenient.

BEST WIRELESS BUDS PERIOD!


I was trying to get back into shape and wanted some decent wireless earbuds. I was looking at some different kinds and talked to my buddy about it and he said hold on, don't buy anything yet. He then told me he has bought the expensive ones and the cheap ones and they just didn't make the cut. He said they all broke from sweat. He mentioned to me these Senso ones and said he has had them over a year and they still work perfectly. This guy does intense workouts sweating up a storm so I knew they must be good. Mine just came in today and OMG. These things sound like they are BEATS headphones. Heck, they might be even better. I haven't worked out in them yet I just set them up to get ready to work out. They sound so amazing. They are so loud too. You can have the volume low and they are perfect. I can't believe how nice they are. Definitely worth the money. Instructions are super simple. They tell you exactly what to do and there's even a diagram of the layout where the power button, volume keys, charging area & light indicator are so there's no wondering where and what. There's even a troubleshoot FAQ as well and it's all in good English, not like those cheap products that have directions with sentences with words missing or misspelled. This is definitely a perfect birthday or Christmas gift. I'm tempted to buy another pair just to have a chill pair. Great job Senso! Amazing!!!!!!!! P.S. I use Spotify every day and a really cool feature once you pair this with your phone is if you want to change tracks of music or go back, you just hold down the volume up key for next track & volume down key to go back a track. I thought that was super awesome. You don't have to grab your phone to change a song. That's super nice. P.S.S. It tells you when it powers on and off. Also when the battery is low, it will start beeping. Like I said, AMAZING!!!!! FOR THE PRICE!!!!!!

Shocking how good they are


$30 ??? And they sound GREAT? .....not just pretty good,  not just really good, but yes, GREAT. I spent $249 on Bose Wire Free but the left side kept going out *read the reviews, it's a really bad problem with them*, so I took them back. I ordered a pair of the 1MORE triple driver AND I ordered the SENSO (because I was hoping for a wireless pair)I was going to try both and send one back, figuring the $30 pair would be going back, but had to try because of the reviews, but positive reviews or not, I still figured there's no way $30 headphones would even be worth bothering with. Boy was I shocked. Both sound almost as good as the $249 BOSE, and are actually better *Because they actually work* and the Bose dont work, period. Bottom line: I'm keeping both.  The 1MORE for at home, the SENSO's for working out ......The sound is shockingly great

Solid product just needs eq adjustment!


Just got these today but I’m am super impressed. Great quality. Connected right up. Love the foam tips! They fit super secure. Also comes with 3 different sized regular tips. My only issue is the unadjusted eq. It’s totally lacking highs and some mids so if your planning on using these for a music app like amazon music or pandora which don’t have an equalizer function these aren’t for you. I ended up downloading Spotify and with a few adjustments to the built in equalizer these things are perfect. I haven’t tested the waterproof side of things but I don’t plan on ever needing it.

Good for user... not so good for person on the other end of the call.


I bought these for my girlfriend so she could listen to music and take phone calls at work or use one earpiece as hands free in the car.  They serve their purpose.  They are comfortable, have a long battery life and she seems happy with the sound quality both for calls and music.  Being on the other end of the call, I can hear everything going on around her a lot better than I can hear her speaking.  I can hear people next to her having a conversation clear as day or dogs barking in the background when she is at work but she practically has to yell for me to hear her.  Unless she is in a quite place with no background noise at all, the sound of everything around her always drowns her out. This is disappointing considering she works in a noisy environment and one of the main reasons for buying the headset was to have a means of contacting her at work.  I also tried connecting it to my tv and could not get it to connect.

I do think these headphones are great for atheletes and those who are going to use ...


After reading through all the reviews, I was really excited for these headphones; however, there are a few negative aspects that make me want to look for another pair. I do think these headphones are great for atheletes and those who are going to use them while exercising, but I purchased them with the intent of using them when I'm at home relaxing or in the car and the negative aspects, I feel, really take away from these headphones.Pros:- Comfortable fit (perfect if you're going to wear them long hours or workout with them)- Feels like they're built well and made to last- Comes with an abundance of cool accessories (if these headphones hadn't come with the lightning charger and car adapter, I may have felt more inclined to return them right away)- Longer battery life than other Bluetooth headphones I've used in the past (however, take bit of the con below)Cons:- There is a very prominent and annoying buzzing sound that only in the left ear that can be heard whenever the music is softer or the headphones are in a ready state (if you open any app that is supposed to have sound and mute the sound in the app it becomes very easy to hear). I had read another review that had mentioned something similar, but did not expect to encounter similar problems. It's not so bad that you can't listen to music, but I find it annoying knowing that it's always there in the background.- The lowest volume setting that the headphones seem to allow is unbelievably loud. The first time I tried to use the headphones, the first thought I had was that the lowest volume setting was going to damage my hearing. Over the past month, I've gotten used to not pushing them completely into my ears (not making a seal, which lets a lot of outside sounds in and thus reducing sound quality) just so that the volume isn't overwhelming. Part of me believes that this was purposefully done in order to mask the buzzing.- Once the headphones reach around 30% battery life, it begins to remind you that the battery is low by saying ""Battery low"". This normally would be a good feature and wouldn't be a problem, but it says this reminder every 30 seconds. It becomes so annoying to hear ""Battery low"" cut into your music that I am unable to use the headphones once they reach this point. It doesn't make sense to me why the reminder needs to be announced so frequently, and it cuts a good 30% off of the total battery life for me.Once again, I think people who are buying these simply for gym/exercise use won't have any issues. The battery is definitely long enough for workout sessions and you would probably like the higher volume and not find the buzzing to be so noticeable in a workout setting. That said, I would not recommend these to anyone who just wants headphones for listening to music in more quiet settings.

What an amazing treasure for my run!


This is one the greatest headphones I have purchased for the price and the quality. I am runner and it makes my run fun. I listen to music for long hours and the sound is excellent. What I like is that it sticks to my ears and do not come out no matter my running speed. Rain or shine it is still works perfectly.I have been using it since July 2017. The first one I bought has a manufactured defect and Senso customer service addressed the issue quickly and replaced it. I really recommended these headphones. No one should spend money on expensive headphones when these are just as good.

Great quality and value. Great customer support


Great quality and value.  I was really impressed with the sound these headphones deliver, and for the price, I can't see how they can be beat.Update:  One problem I have found with these headphones is that on my IPhone 7, I have to delete them from my Bluetooth settings after each use and then restore them when listening to books on Audible.com.  If not, I get intermittent reception when listening to Audible.com books.  It doesn't seem to be a problem with other Aps.  Since I mainly use them for books, it is a bit of a nuisance. It may be an Apple issue for all I know, but I thought it worth mentioning.About 3 months after purchase, the unit failed.  Contacted vendor and replacement sent right out.  Can't beat that for service.

They're okay


Good for the price but bass is muddy. To be fair, I play a form of EDM, drum and bass music- which is hard sweeping/ vibrating bass. The bass was so muddy that I had to turn the volume down. Then I could hear cars driving along side me, and on my iPhone earphones this wasn't the case. These will do for now. They came fast, look nice. I did have to use the smallest earbuds because they didn't fit, but I ran 6 miles without having to adjust much.UPDATE 4/29/2017: They do not work all of a sudden. I have been charging for a few days... They finally work again. I also had to delete them from my phone and then reactivate. I had to run with no beats for a few days and I wasn't too happy about that. I am investing in a pair for my iPhone.

Like them.


I have had the ear buds for over a week and have exercised while wearing the earbuds several times.  When I run they work ok except when my ears sweat then I have some issues with the earbuds staying in place. But this has only happen a couple times.  The sound is pretty good.  I have had connection issues.  For example today While wearing the earbuds at the gym it disconnected and reconnected to my phone several times. Not sure why being the photographer me was with in 2 feet of the earbuds.  A little annoying loosing what I'm listening to for a second but also the earbuds tell you when you disconnect and reconnect. Other than that decent product.

A great solution for music lovers who have to be able to quicky switch to phone.


I walk about 10 mile a day.  I also have to be able to take calls at all times.  I've tried several options, ie bluetooth in ear for phones (I care TWO)  and body speaker for tunes, and it was just frustrating as well as not functional quality for either.  These allow me to listen to my music IN stereo without broadcasting to the whole world and they connect to my active phone at the same time.  They allow enough external sound to reach my ears with volume turned down to reasonable, which we all should do anyway to prevent hearing damage, so as to be safe to use in traffic. The automatic shift to phone is a big plus over messing with a second device as well.

and they sound better than any ear-bud headphones I've ever owned


I have had these headphones for a week now and they have exceeded my expectations.  I have a Lenovo business laptop running Windows 7, a 5 year old HP laptop running Windows 10, and a 4 year old Android phone running Android 4.4.2.  These headphones had no problem connecting to any of these old devices, and they sound better than any ear-bud headphones I've ever owned, including wired headphones.  I was also surprised they do block some external noise.  I don't remember reading anything saying they would, but they do.  I wear them for about five hours a day while working on my computer and they are very comfortable.  The battery lasts a little over a day, so between 6 and 8 hours of continuous use.  Not too bad for such a small package.  I recommend these to anyone looking for a good sounding pair of ear buds.

Finally the right Headphones!!!!


When I was first looking for a Bluetooth set of headphones I went through all of the normal channels for review. And let me tell you I hit a bunch of snags along the way some headphones I got did not hold well over my ears. Some headphones I got did not fit in my ear. But the worst were the ones I tried that sounded horrible. So I went on to amazon and thought I'll give one more pair with a great review a shot. Well let me tell you these are amazing first the hooks over your ear hold them snug but the flexible hook doesn't feel heavy or hurt like some start to do. Second they come with an assorted set of earbuds to fit all shapes and sizes but the memory foam style they come with are perfect. All you do is squeeze them and let them expand in your ear and they are snug and to be honest cancel a lot of outside noise out. And lest the sound quality and range of volume impress and the bass is dynamic but not over powering perfect for most pump up workout songs. These will be my go to brand for a long time and am excited to see what they have in store for the future!

I love these headphones


I love these headphones! I have a really hard time with keeping headphones inside of my ear because my ear holes are really small. These stay in great! Even when I am running, I feel comfortable and I don't even have to worry about them. It's so convenient to be able to adjust the volume and change the song without taking your phone out as well. I can't have my phone out at work but I can listen to music so it's perfect for what I ned. The rubber on the ear part is hard to clean but I'll let that slide because they work so well. I also wish they had a longer run time because I will use them at work and while exercising and I feel like I always have to recharge them.

This is my third set of Bluetooth headset the first worked great.for about it a year.The ear buds would not stay in verry well nor were they comfertabl.  but after some moderate use one ear bud quit working on one side after six months.tolerable but no cigar for 150.00 bucks really 6 months.Well on to the next gen style ear buds were a little uncomfortable but stayed in place some.little pricey but waterproof said so right on the box...... well at work the controller not so water proof wet hands oh well ,dryed them out worked well enough. Not very loud  for a noisy background area  then the battery started dyeing fast all the time. Not even a hour of use  trying to charge them one day they fell on the floor shattered one came compleaty apart now useless.... 75 down the drainOne week of use WTF..Seen your buds on amazon kinda sceptical read a lot  of reviews abought them now....YOUR ARE THE BOMB..Thank you love the comfert for long term use its  great.lots of ear bud sizes which do fit me very well.Love ease of use  no small bumps On a wire you have chase on your neck to  to adjust the volume.  And they dont care if they get wet nor do they fall out.Thank you.....  Scott H.

Bought twice and both died after for five months


I bought these for the first time in March 2019. They worked great (great bass) then they stopped working in August 2019. I didn't want to deal with the warranty process. Since they were such a reasonable price, I decided to just buy them again that same month and hope that they would last the second time around. Again, they were working great and I loved them so much that I even bought my mom a pair (which she loves and is still using).Now, it's January 2020 (exactly five months out like the last time) and they've stopped working again. I'm disappointed because I really loved these headphones. I didn't and don't expect them to last more than a year at $20, but I had hoped to actually reach the one year mark with them.I'll try my best to submit a warranty for these, since I'm still technically within a year, but I don't think I can justify buying these a third time. Hopefully my warranty goes through and I'll have at least another five months of wireless listening to save up for something better.

Constant ringing in left earpiece, makes product painful to use :(


Just bought this, right earpiece works fine but left earpiece has a constant buzzing sound whenever its connected to any bluetooth device.The sound is painful so may be a health hazard and I don't want to risk my hearing.Wanted to like this product but so far its a dud :(EDIT: Revised this upwards to a 4 from a 1 in November 2017, so Senso indeed did ship me a dud on the first one, but once I contacted customer service they were very prompt and I got another replacement within 1 week. I've been using the new one for 1 month and so far there is no left ear ringing issue. I still think the sound quality is only so-so and the fit isn't great compared to the Anker Soundsport I used before this, but for $30 its a decent bluetooth headphone I can't complain too much about.

I went forward with this purchase because it had extras like card wallet and a magnetic phone mount


I purchased this product due to my other workout wireless phones going out. I went forward with this purchase because it had extras like card wallet and a magnetic phone mount. Although I do like the extras, I have no use for them.One thing I do not like about this headphone is that it wraps my right ear but not my left... so as I'm jump roping or running, the left one tends to fall off. The left and right hook are not curved the same. I am thinking of dipping the right hook into hot water or use a heat gun to warp it but haven't done it yet. The old earphones I had was designed the same way but it does not fall off like this one does. I might need to either reconsider next future purchases that have this hook issue.

Big Sound For the Buck


Huge upgrade to a balky Jabra Sport and exactly what I was looking for!  Audio is much better than I expected at this price point, clear crisp treble and mid range with warm bass and excellent volume controls.  Immediately detected by my Samsung 7S and pared instantly.  Included a functional set of accessories in a compact storage case.  Button controls are in all the right places making it easy to adjust volume, skip tracks, answer phone calls, even has a redial option.  So far not a single CON I can come up but we'll see how the phones hold up after sweating buckets in the hot Midwest summer.  A great value overall and would definitely recommend to friends.

Nice Design; Long Battery Life; Good Quality Sound


Upon opening the package, I was pleased with the design and the extra charging cable, car charger, and a ""wire tie,"" which is a small plastic ""clamp: that allows you to adjust the length of the cord that is up against your neck. Pairing the headset to two bluetooth devices was simple and worked just as described in the User Guide. I like that are volume controls on one of the earpieces, as well as a multi-function button that allows you to answer incoming calls, redial the latest number called, etc. I've had the headset for only a few days, but, so far, I am very pleased with the product.

The earloops used to be more comfortable.


I had previously purchased an older model and I feel that the older models ear loops are more comfortable: flatter, softer, and more flexible. Granted the older version's loop is thicker, just has a better feel. Other than that, such a quality buy. I've had two co-workers that purchased these and love them.I can also attest to their water proof-ness. I was paddleboarding and had my Sensos in my pocket and they did get dunked a few times. Put them on and they worked fine.Update: While comfortable, and waterproof, these aren't rolling chair wheel proof, as just now the swivel wheels on my chair just demolished on earbud.

Great Bluetooth headphones for the price...battery and connectivity is lacking.


I've owned these for several months now, and I'm comfortable enough to pass judgement on them. They're good headphones for the price, but the battery life and connectivity experiences are flawed.Audio Quality:Audio is clear and crisp for both spoken audio and music, but these are pretty bass-heavy. There isn't any way to adjust the audio profile either, so if you're ok with that then these will work. Personally, I don't care that much, as these are 30 bucks.Connectivity:I have tried this on two different devices: an Android and an iPhone, as well as my MacBook Pro. Connectivity is kind of spotty overall to be honest. On Android, the headphones took anywhere from 10 - 20 seconds to connect. On iPhone, it connects quickly, but takes 20 seconds to recognize them as audio devices...if it does at all, in which case you'll have to restart the headset and try again. It will let me push the button on the side to play/pause, but will play the sound through the internal speakers until the bluetooth headset symbol appears in the corner (which has a useful battery display as well). This is pretty annoying, but once it's connected, you don't have to worry about it disconnecting.Battery:Connectivity is a minor annoyance, but the battery is a larger issue for me. It's advertised as lasting 8 hours, but in my experience the average over the several months I've had these (from full charge, mind) is about 3-4 hours. Which is really annoying because you can't charge them and listen at the same time, it disconnects you from all devices. 8 hours would be great as it will last me a full work day, but they never do. Around half way through the day it starts spamming me with 'BATTERY LOW' every minute until it shuts off after about 10 minutes...at which point I have to let it charge for an hour before I can make it through the last couple of hours in my workday. This means that if you work out in the evening, don't use this during the workday...you'll have to charge it for a while before it's useable.These would be perfect if the battery lasted longer and connectivity wasn't such a finicky experience. I'd say get em if you're not using them as daily headphones (i.e. just for workouts), but if you want something you can use all day, look into the JLabs Epic2 or the Jaybird X2.

Love and hate


I love this headphones at first. The fit is great the look is great but there's a lot of issues here.  The first issue I have is with the accessories so the charger for the headphones stopped working after two uses. The iPhone charger stopped working after about a week of use. The headphones themselves are great other then that fact that at times they sound like I'm under water. The microphone on them is usesless you will hav e to scream so the person you are talking to can hear you. The back piece that holds the wires together is always on the edge of getting lose(it literally comes of every use).  I recommended this headphones to a co worker before I realized this issues. I hope he's comes out better and that mines were just a bad batch. If not I'll feel terrible and have to buy him a next pair.

Good, but not Great...


I previously left a review much higher.  I have been ""trying out these headphones because I wanted to give them as gifts.  They are incredibly easy to set up, and easy to  use.  AND the sound is good for what you are paying.  This would be a great gift for a young teen, or someone not concerned with crisp, clear sound.But after an hour or so of listening (I tried them several times) I was ready to take them off.  The sound is not what I'm looking for, and I'm sure my older children would want a higher quality sound.  I'd rather pay more, and get more.Again, this is a great gift for someone not as concerned with clear sound.  They are easy to use, and easy to set up.

Great functionality despite poor build quality and periodic, but minor drop outs....


The build quality is relatively poor (even the LED status light isn't aligned correctly with the hole it is supposed to shine through), but that doesn't translate into a poor experience.  Quite the opposite.  It is at least 5x cheaper than the Beats or equivalent name brand offerings, and outside of dropping the connection about 10-100x more (rare for Beats given my experience and use cases where the source/iPhone is in my pocket) - it is a outstanding value.UPDATE:  After a few months of light use (no rain at all) - these crapped out.  Work for a few minutes and then disconnect.

Either they didn't fit right or the battery life was poor or the microphone didn't work particularly well on phone ...


I tried several pairs of wireless earbuds, including Beats, before I got these and had found drawbacks with them all. Either they didn't fit right or the battery life was poor or the microphone didn't work particularly well on phone calls. These are exactly what I wanted when trying all the others. I use them quite a bit some days & have yet to have the battery run out. I just recharge them at night & I'm good to go for the next day. Couldn't recommend them more highly. Wish they had an inline controller/microphone but the lack of one does not detract for their overall outstanding  performance for me. Well done, Senso. Very well done!

Two and a half stars


These headphones are good for the price point, but have a few annoying features.The sound quality is decent and they work for a commute, not sure if they would stay in for a run or other high impact activities.  I don't mind the buttons, but they do take an adjustment period because they aren't intuitive.My two main complaints are that while the sound quality is good, if I put my phone in my bag or pocket it will cause the audio to breakup like the connection is not very good.  It sounds like the horrible days when a cd would skip.  It's constant and completely annoying.  My only recourse is the carry my phone.  This works, but is a complete pain that I cannot put my phone in my bag and be hands free!Secondly, the stupid low battery announcements are a bad design and they start when the headphones have 30% battery.  I can almost understand if the percentage is off, but the stupid lady cuts in every minute with ""low battery"" for a solid five to six minutes before the headphones shut off.  One low battery notification is enough.  Also, if they do cut off because the battery dies, you then have to resync to your phone when they are charged.Overall, they fit the purpose, but if you can afford better quality, go for it.

Best BT Headphones so far for me


I've owned a few pair (Over the ear and in the ear) BT headphones over the last 10 years.  These are the best I've owned so far because of the sound, size and cost.  The ONLY con for me would be the battery life.  I can only get about 2 days (avg 5 hours per day).  I use them when I ride, my bike or catch the train into work and while at work.  I don't use them at home because there's no need to.  The buyer would like these.  I didn't buy the ear plugs because I'm too afraid of loosing them (1 or both)..

Overall okay bluetooth earphones


I paid about $23 for the red button ones I've used for about a week now I give them 3 stars which means they are okay these are the first wireless earphones I use so I can't compare them to any other I like they are light have decent sound and stay connected most of the time. What I would don't like is the battery life they only last about two hours fully charged and that they have a blue light that blinks every five seconds when they are connected haven't used for running yet but I'm sure that it would not be a problem since there a hook that wraps around you ear.

Brok quickly But received replacement without extra charge.


The sound quality of this wireless SENSO headphone is good. Control of Bluetooth connection and ON/OFF is not so straightforward. But the worst part was that it broke so quickly within a couple of months of random usage in bed or at my desk the earbud where ON/OFF is hosted was lost. Unfair for something not so cheap.update since I reported the broken/lost earbud from where the Bluetooth is controlled:08-22/2018The company was quick to get in touch with me. Literally, as soon as I posted the review. I followed their instruction on how to get my SENSO replaced since they were still under warranty. The support team was understanding and sent a replacement to my new home address under 3 days. Fantastic job standing by the product. I wish LG did the same when my phone kept quitting on me and had to send it 3 times for repair,  and never got actually fully repaired despite being under Warranty.Excellent job from the support team.

I got these in Feb 2018 and I am still using them almost daily at the gym. These are amazing quality headphones. Don't be fooled by the price I was surprised by the sound quality. I only used Bose products before I got these but these are better than Bose. They hold the charge for almost an entire week. I am surprised with the negative comments about these products. Pairing is easy and range is good. I am not paid to write these reviews these are honest and genuine review, I waited an entire year to write this, buy with full confidence, won't regret it.

... months now and I have to say they have good sound quality


I've been using these for a few months now and I have to say they have good sound quality, battery life, and I have yet to have a technical issue with them. I do however have issues with them failing out while excising which is a huge bummer. The earbud sizes are nice and all and do indeed help keep them in better or worse, but the real solution given their size would be adjustable ear hooks in order to give them that extra bit of support. The gel flex ear hooks should have some internal hardened yet flexible material like what glasses use to better conform to each persons ear. They always fall out just enough to get caught by the hook, but constantly having to push them back in is annoying. If the ear hooks were not just flexible enough to be comfortable, but also rigid enough to actually be useful I would rate these 5 stars.

Great!


I totally love these. They stay in my ears, the sound quality is good (I am not an audiophile, but I've been pleased), and they come with a lot of accessories. Drawbacks: the ""low battery"" voice repeats forever until you plug them in (though the charge is generally good enough to get me through a day); they are hard to find if you put them down somewhere (user error!); sometimes the connection is a little wonky if my phone is too far away or there is some large metal object around. If I keep my phone in my pocket or purse, no problem. I listen to a lot of podcasts while cooking/cleaning/exercising, and the wirelessness (and fit) is just fantastic. Another plus/minus: they really block out outside sounds (for me) while playing something -- so I make sure to tell my family I won't be able to hear them.

Great headphones


I was worried when I first got these because it seemed like my ears were too small for the over the ear pieces and the ear piece. Turns out the over the ear piece bends to makes it smaller and fit on my ears. It comes with smaller ear pieces, so I swapped those out and it fits in my ear like I want now.  I got these so I could watch tv at night and not worry about bothering my neighbor who goes to bed early. I’ve charged these twice since Christmas, but I would consider myself a light user maybe 30 min- hour at a time, so it last because I make sure it’s turned off.

... for designer ones because I knew there was a good chance I'd misplace them


I really wanted a wireless headphone for my workouts but didn't want to shell out $99+ for designer ones because I knew there was a good chance I'd misplace them.  At the same time I wanted good quality.  These did the job and then some!  They stayed in my ears during all my workouts- treadmill, outdoor running, weight lifting- and especially came in handy when doing guided workouts through my phone in the gym.  There were 1 or 2 times where I thought they died- customer service got back to me right away, instructed me to reset and I was back in business. A car even accidentally ran over them (long story) and they still worked!Needless to say after 7 months I did misplace them so I will be repurchasing again:)

Superior quality product for a fraction of the cost of ""brand name"" equivalent.


I recently received these headphones that I decided to purchase as a replacement for my beats headphones. Since I was not able to test this product (nature of online shopping), I felt I need to trust posted buyer reviews. Here are my first impressions for these headphones.I am impressed by the sound quality and the bass for a product that costs the only a fraction of the ""name brand"" equivalent. The volume available in these headphones is excellent; the bass is significantly better to the one that I needed to replace. I instantly noticed the superb fit. I always struggle with in-ear headphones as I am unable to find a product that will stay in my right ear during the exercise. So far I only used the ear tip attachment that comes standard, but there are an additional three sizes to customize the fit.There are several accessories that come with the headphones. Already mentioned three sizes of ear tips, short charging cable (I am using this cable in my car), dual port car charger, wire tie (to create a tight fit around the neck for cable connecting left and right headphone, carrying case, and finally 3ft long USB convertible charging cable for these headphones and iPhone.

Falls out of Ears & After 3 Months Will not Turn on


Was excited to get.  I got and worked okay, but when working out it falls out of my ears.  I could live with that, but then after about 3 months, would no longer turn on.  Battery light showed fully charged.  Said one year warranty, but when registered with manufacturer, no way to see how to return.  Emailed and got nothing back.  If one relies on head set, this is a big issue.  So still received nothing back from manufacturer.  I purchased the Soundbeat Q30.  Does not fall out my ears.  Spend long time on line looking for ways to turn on, but only found other people had similar problems.  Then saw small note on manual, that says don't charge overnight, can affect batter life.  Just not a good product and still have not heard back from them.  Would like a refund.  Not like it is a lot of money, but adds up.  I do not recommend this product.  Especially since customer service sucks.

I purchased these to wear while mowing my lawn.  There is no apparent noise cancelling functionality.  I will say it again, they do not allow me to listen to music while mowing.  I set them aside.  I have given up my search for noise cancelling earphones because the only thing that works it the full ear covering muffs designed for shooter or equipment operators.  I tried  using these..under muff type protectors.  They are too big and very uncomfortable.  They are very bulky and difficult to wear and can not imagine wearing them in gym..

decent headphones


These headphones are good quality however the design is poor. First of all they are fairly bulky. Primarily, the fit is uncomfortable as it starts to hurt my ear after awhile. I have owned a few other brands of headphones so I know how to fit them correctly. The plastic sits too close to the ear so it applies pressure and hurts after awhile. I tried to bring this to Senso's attention so they could have an opportunity to possibly improve their design but they instead blamed it on me stating that I do not know how to properly fit the headphones. I will keep them because they work, but I am not too impressed with the fit. I will say they have good battery life and sound quality. I have not had trouble with them breaking yet however I may have to wait another few months and see!

Hands down best headphones I've ever purchased


I've only used these headphones a few times but I'm already impressed! The bluetooth is so handy for exercising! No more lugging my phone around and navigating the cord (which is super annoying when lifting weights). The sound quality is amazing; loud, clear, and crisp audio.  And best of all... the ear buds stay put! I use these while running and they don't budge.  Customer service is also fantastic.  I received a message directly from the seller notifying me they had shipped and was contacted again after they were delivered to make sure I was happy with the purchase.

with audio quality as good as any


I've had this headset for almost a year now, which I believe makes it the longest-lasting headset I've had. The battery lasts well. If I listen to music constantly I get 6+ hours between charges; more normal intermittent use only requires a daily charge.They seem very robust. Much more so than various LGs and Plantronics I've had, with audio quality as good as any. The range is better than any other headset I've owned.After pairing with several different devices (separately) the audio developed a stutter. I followed the instructions in one of the answered questions here for a factory reset, re-paired and it recovered perfectly. (Turn the headset off, plug into a charging source, and while it is charging, hold the power button for a couple of seconds until you see a blue flash.)The one feature they're missing, inexplicably to me, is voice dialing. I don't believe I've ever had another headset that doesn't interface to my Android phone's voice dialer. If it had that I'd give it five stars.I mostly wanted to write a review to leave a note on using this headset as multipoint. This is *not* covered in the documentation, so I assume it's not a supported feature, but I tried the instructions for a different headset (Phaiser BHS-730, which I bought because it is multipoint and which I don't like in any way as much as this headset, in particular that they lasted only a month before the right side failed) and I have the headset paired with a phone and tablet at the same time. Again, this isn't supported, so your mileage may vary:Pair the headset with one device. Now turn off that device's bluetooth, power off the SENSO headset, then power it back on, holding the power button until the indicator light flashes red and blue. Pair with the second device. Now turn the first device's bluetooth back on and manually connect from the bluetooth menu.Pairing to two devices works fine; connecting to both can be finnicky. It can help to turn the bluetooth off on the currently-connected device, connect manually to the other, then reconnect to the first, but the Phaiser (which does claim to be multipoint) had exactly the same issues, so it's no more awkward than a supported multipoint headset.When using two devices, you don't need to switch between them. Start an audio source on either device and you'll hear it on the headset. The multi-function button will then stop and start that device. If you listen to the other, the multi-function button will control that. If you're watching a video on the tablet, you may need to pause it and answer the phone manually, but once you've done so the headset works with the phone.If you move out of range of one of the devices the headset will stutter. If I know I'm moving away from one device I'll power off the headset, and power it back on when I'm out of its normal range, at which point the headset will connect only to the closer device with no stutter.I've been far more pleased with this headset than any other. (But why oh why no voice dialing?...)

I am very pleased with the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones


I am very pleased with the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones, the sound quality is great as well as the craftsmanship, operation and linking is very intuitive and and the signal range from Headphones to cell are within my expected working limits especially at the gym which is my intended use of said device. I dropped the SENSO Headphones in a water filled sink and was pleased to learn that no damaged was caused by the water immersion. I've used the SENSO Headphones for five continuous hours without any sound or signal degradation that I can think of. Comfort is important especially at the gym and I have to say that the SENSO Headphones felt quite comfortable and caused no irritation around my ears, I noticed that among the different ear buds that come standard with the SENSO Headphones the was a separate small plastic baggie which contains a different kind of ear buds, this particular set is made out of foam and resembles the same kind of foam plugs that someone would wear for hearing protection, they're small and fit in my ear canal just right, and the best part is that they're able drown out all outside noise while the music is at a descent level. I would like to see a more advanced and powerful SENSO Headphone set from Invotek in the future that has over the ears coverage but for now I'm enjoying this set with no problems.

Great sound, great convenience


My first impression when I heard music through the headphones was: Wow! These sound great! The sound is better than any headphone that I have ever used. (I have never used any really expensive headphones). They are also reasonably comfortable. I was also impressed by the range; they easily connect across the room (which is a mixed blessing, since they may connect to the wrong device). The battery life is also impressive. They work with my iPhone and my MacBook Pro (at the same time!), as well as my Android tablet. The negative: I don't notice any noise reduction, they barely fit in the provided container, there is sometimes a little buzzing when the volume is too high and I think they are ugly. For me, the positive greatly outweighs the negative. It feels great to be able to listen to music at my desk and not worry about the earphone pulling out of my ear when I lean away from my computer, and the great sound is a real bonus!

We had beats that were not very comfortable and did not last long.  They were trash compared to SENSO and cost a whole lot more money.  We thought we would take a chance on these after reading reviews.  They have great sound and balance.  We use them to listen to audio book and music.  The charge lasts between up to 24 hours.  They are very comfortable to wear.  I barely know I have them on.  I can get about 50 feet away from the source before they start cutting out.  They do not fall out of my ears.

Review by a guy who sweats more than a teenager trying to find a girl to dance with at prom


Amazing! I've used these headphones at the gym and mowing grass for about 2 months now and they have to be the best bluetooth headphones I've ever had. I originally bought $100 Plantronics headphones for use at the gym, but they didn't make a tight seal like these do. The foam inserts are the best by far. They assist with canceling out the noise, and don't get wet and slip like the gel inserts do. I sweat like a whore in church on a Sunday in August so I have put these to the test. They have yet to fall out and I don't even need to adjust them more than once during my hour and a half workout.ONLY PROBLEM: I need more foam inserts, my are becoming dirty and would love to find more somehow!

I bought these headphones after my disappointment with a previous pair


I bought these headphones after my disappointment with a previous pair. I run whole listening to music. My old pair didn't fit right and I would keep having to adjust them while I ran. Also, the volume control was located on the cord  just under the left ear bud, causing it to move unnecessarily. When I went looking for a new pair, I knew what I wanted; good fit, good quality, ease of use, and value. That's what I now have in my Senso headphones! The buttons are on the earpiece itself, causing even weight distribution between the two headphones when running. Even sweat doesn't loosen the fit on my ears. They are easy to use and pair up easily via Bluetooth. I have only used them a few times, but I can tell that the quality is good. Lastly, they didn't break my wallet. These are everything I was looking for and I'm happy to own them!

Quality materials, great accessories, great audio levels!


Great Bluetooth headphones! I looked at beats and even Bose earbuds... these are super loud, I can't even turn it up to medium volume before I consider it enough volume for me, so the power is there.They could use a little bit improvement on the lows rather than the highs being so aggressive.The materials are super soft and you can barely feel them on your ears, the added accessories are great too, love the carrying case. You can tell this company put their sweat and tears to the product and since it's a start up company, is the consumers benefit from that!Overall great earbuds at a great price, don't spend your hard earned money on those other high priced earbuds that do the same or are of less quality than these.

I’ve used them once so far but what struck me is how much this company takes the time to do the details.-Packaging was a little tough to open but it is very clean and professional unlike some others.-Earbuds are in a very durable case and clean with extra buds-package contains goodies such as a car phone holder and a phone card wallet as well as a very helpful instruction booklet that is 100% English, not broken translated English, and a charging cord.-******This is what caught my attention, the president of the company sent me a personal email regarding my satisfaction of the order.  That shows passion for a company to strive and that bought me into this 5 star rating.  Yes, everything else is fine but when an owner takes time out of his busy schedule to make sure you, the customer, are satisfied, that speaks volumes to me.  Awesome product and an awesome company.

Good for less than a year


I bought these at the end of February 2019 and they worked great until now, 11 months later. I’ve noticed the Bluetooth range has become much shorter and it will start to cut out at about 15 ft away. The battery used to last a weeks worth of workouts or so and now it’s one workout. Twice this week I’ve gotten to the gym and they’ve been dead when usually I could charge them on Sunday and make it through at least four 1-1.5 hour workouts before it started saying battery low.  Now they just don’t turn on.

I'm impressed


The bluetooth connection was so easy and the sound quality and bass is pretty awesome. Remember, this isn't Bose so after considering the price this product is impressive. You can still vaguely hear surrounding noises so it isn't noise cancelling. There are different sizes for the ear piece and the part that goes around the ear is flexible and soft. I've jump roped, ran, jogged, and sweated a lot with these on and they've stayed in so I am a satisfied customer! Warning! Once you hit max volume, there is a single loud screeching chime to let you know! It may not bother some people but I was shook when it hit my ear drums for the first time so heads up!

Amazing Sound & Build


with 9000 reviews you don't need another glowing five star review to make you get this, but what the heck...here's my two cents, this is my first wireless sports headset and while I had some loose right ear problems (ear bud selection fixed that because it came with a bunch of them to see what works for the ear)I made it through a few gym workouts / walks / jogs / treadmill with full sound -- I keep it slightly higher than half for a full block out -- which is a huge step from the previous headset.I really like the foam grip ear thingys much better than solid plastic (which starts to hurt my ear after long use). The battery life is a solid 6-8 hours of use.Stop reading and give this a shot...

Wires exposed after only 1 use


After receiving my headphones & using then only once, my the wiring was exposed. I reached out to them to let them know the problem and was told to contact Amazon and have them send me a return kit and return them. I dont have time for this. I've had them for only 1 day and the wiring was showing. But besides that issue, the ear loops were a little large on me and I have the average ear and the quality was not that great... No bass. I would not recommend this product. Especially with the customer service I received. $30 down the drain. Sucks

Well worth the money, good headset


For a pair of sub $40 bluetooth headphones I was really impressed.  The box contained a ton of accessories from a car charger, two charging cables (longer one with an apple and micro USB cord) and a short usb --> micro usb cable, and various ear buds.The sound on the bluetooth headset is clear and louder than a bose pair of $150 soundsports I have.  They stay on and in my ear during my morning run, as long as the waterproof technology is good and it doesn't short out my headset (like the Bose product I was replacing) they'll be all good.  The over the ear clips are soft and flexible, which I couldn't tell from the product description, very happy they aren't firmer plastic, they are very comfortable on the ear during a run.

ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL


WARNING! These earphones are being marketed as useful during physical activity.  They might be, if your ears fit the earphone perfectly.  They do not fit me at all.  There is no way to secure them to my ears because the ear hook is too large and flimsy.  It is not adjustable.  How they managed to get so many positive reviews is bewildering to me.  There must be a lot of couch potatoes buying these things.  They're fine, if you don't move while wearing.  Unless your workout regimen consists of sitting in a recliner while wiggling your toes, be prepared to be disappointed, if your ears don't fit these things perfectly.

these have sound that I can only assume is meant to rival with headphones like beats. They do get really loud without distortion


PROS: these have sound that I can only assume is meant to rival with headphones like beats. They do get really loud without distortion. Has a deep bass if you like your music with more bass than you’re used to on standard headphones. Packaging was great, comes with travel case, a car USB charger,  and cable that is a combo iPhone/USB Micro.CONS:  These ear buds would not stay in my ears. I tried all the various cup sizes from small to large and they kept popping out when running or rowing. I’ve also used them while cycling and they pick up a HUGE amount of wind noise. I could barely hear the music. iPhone cable may not be compatible with aftermarket waterproof type cases.

Seriously love these


These headphones are the real deal and I’m glad I bought them. Purchased the red pair in Jan 2018 and fast forward to now, Nov 2018, they still work great. My ears are weird and headphones never sit in my ears right, especially when working out. I never have issues with these coming out of my ears when exercising, they stay in place. Battery life for me is about a week which is pretty good for the price. Sound quality is great too. No connectivity issues, and they work fine at long ranges away from my phone too. My favorite part is that they drown out outside noise. With Apple headphones you can still hear all the noise around you, but these headphones are so solid I only hear my music and it’s great. Totally worth the buy.

the ear pieces are held firmly and comfortably in place


Pros: the ear pieces are held firmly and comfortably in place. The sound quality is very good. Cons: the ""tangle free cable"" that connects the ear pieces is by no means sturdy-looking or tangle-free. In fact it is thin, longer than necessary, wraps around itself and tangles, and tends to hang off to one side or the other. I personally would have preferred a more sturdy and shorter cable which would have been more aesthetically pleasing. The second problem is that when my iPhone (that has a case) is touching my skin at the gym, such as when I have it tucked at the inside belt of my yoga pants, the sound cuts off sporadically and quite noticeably. This problem is resolved when I move my iPhone to my pocket.

the best headphones ever


I have not yet found a pair of headphones as good as these even looking for things triple the price. I have had these headphones for about four years now and they have never let me down. First, they sound amazing and have an impressive amount of bass, in my opinion, though it is not overpowering. Second, they actually work really well for isolating of cancelling out noise. I typically can't hear people speaking to me even if they are only a few feet away from me. I have used them on planes and they really get rid of the drone of the engine. I can't say enough how much I love these.

Overall, for $35 (Now $20), these headphones are really good.


Overall, these headphones aren't bad.Sound Quality: This might have been the best headphones I've ever heard. There is a really nice bass and the sound overall is really clear. It has great noise cancellation so you can't hear other noises, and people near you can't listen to what your listening.Comfort: The headphones were bigger than expected. It came with three ear pieces (Small, Medium, and Large). It also came with a nice foam piece that you can form into the size you want. The hook works well and it stays in your ear.Connection: The connection to your device is simple and easy (Took around 3 minutes). The length though is a little disappointing, it works for around 15 feet away from your device before it starts to become staticky and un-listenable.Extra: The box came with a charger (way to small (3 in.) ), a usb to Apple lightning charger, a car charger, and a small pouch. I was king of disappointed when 1 day after I ordered these head phones, the price dropped down from 35 to 20 dollars. The strand that connects the two together is a little bit lengthy and can get tangeled up.

Dissapointed in the second pair I purchased!


This is my second pair to purchase, the first lasted right over a year which I was happy with, and I used them almost daily. BUT this new pair I got has problems. They don’t fit near as well, (strange because they look identical) but the biggest problem is connecting to blue tooth. It will say, power on, connected, but not be connected. Sometimes I have to turn them off and on several times before they finally connect, which is very frustrating. I’m disappointed because I loved the first pair so much, and these are so much more inferior. Looks like I’ll have to go back to my never ending quest to find headphones I like and can afford...

buyer beware


I bought these because they were cheaper than buying 2 70$ at the time I bought them. they did what I wanted them to and at the same time didn't. I bought 2 of them one for my girlfriend and the other for myself. good sound while listening to music if you held your head just right. the cord from either earbud would wiggle and sound would cut out. and this was only after 3 months of use. it was great for sound while talking to someone on the phone but picked up all background noise and multiplied it by 400% so much that you could hear yourself talk. and on really good days you would get feed back and have to yank them out your ear so they wouldn't bleed. I'd give it a one star but I did like the fit in my ear. they have a 1 year shelf life of use. my girlfriend pair died 1 week before mine did. she would be talking or listening to music and it would hang up or turn her music off. then stopped working. luckily my pair didn't hang up the left earbud died and then the right. another thing is the way the hook fit behind the ear. To me, it fit fine and stayed put however on my girlfriend her ears being a bit smaller the hook kept flopping in front of her ear

And I thought the Klipsch R6i had good bass...


I've only been using these for 15 minutes, but... wow. These are my first wireless headphones. I had heard can achieve superior performance because they can have their own drivers and amplifiers and circumvent the impedance of the long cable, but I didn't expect this much of a difference! Before these, I had been using the 
Klipsch R6i In-Ear Headphones
. The R6i was my third time buying Klipsch, whose headphones were consistently rated best performance for the money on CNET. The R6i were notable for their very good bass, but these SENSO headphones blow them out of the water [not that the R6i would have survived in water, of course ;) ]. As was mentioned, the volume is very good. In a quiet environment, I don't need to go higher than the lowest level. I'm no audiophile, but as someone who appreciates higher sound quality enough to have tried several < $50 headphones to replace Apple's generic ones, I can say the average person will see a VERY noticeable difference.Naturally, I haven't had time to evaluate the durability or battery life, but I will make an update if they are any different than advertised.

Like most of us I’ve had my fare share of bluetooth headphones but these stand head and shoulders above the rest. The sound quality is very good and I’m comparing the sound quality to similar headphones in its class Kinivio and trent bluetooth headphones. Pairing with iPhone and Apple watch was flawless. These unlike other earbuds I’ve tried are actually quite comfortable to wear. The ear strap doesn’t hurt my ear and the battery life is superb.You can’t go wrong with these earphones it even comes with a carry case which comes in handy for me since I usually just throw my headphones in my bag along with my laptop and school books. The case provides some protection for them.In conclusion, I highly recommend these headsets it’s going to be hard to beat the value and quality these headphones provide.

Huge Fan!!


I waited to write a review until I had used these for a week or so.  Today I sat on conference calls for 3+ hours then worked out and listened to music and an interval app for an hour.  It wasn't until the cool down that I got an alert that the battery was low!  The sound is great on these!  My workout was full of up and down movements, jumping jacks, etc and these headphones did not budge--sweating and all!!  I purchased these based on the top review and he did not lie!!  I have told several friends about these--some that workout and some that are on calls a lot during the day.  The case, chargers and car charger with adapter were amazing bonuses!!!  Amazing deal!

Best buy of the year


I have been struggling with wired headphones while running since my very first iPod a dozen or so years ago.  Then Apple in all their wisdom zaps the headphone jack off the iPhone in an attempt to force you into their outrageously expensive Bluetooth buds.  Well, here's your answer.  These headphones are actually ear buds which are my go to for running.  Many different size pads to custom fit the sets to your exact ear size.  No wire to yank your phone out of your hands or frustrate you to death while your running.  The sound is not TOP shelf but I'm quite particular and these are good enough to way more than justify the price.

Not great for running


Pros:•inexpensive•good sound quality when connectedCons:•my primary use with these is running, and they pick up a very loud wind sound when running in anything but still air (quite annoying but forgiveable)•Though the over-ear clips certainly help keep them ON the ear, I had a lot of difficulty keeping the buds INSIDE my ear (while running) compared to other Bluetooth ear buds•I'm not sure if the set I received was just on the low end of the manufacturer's specification requirements for connectivity, but unless my phone was on an arm band less than a foot away from the headset, these had much difficulty gaining a continuous connection, especially when located anywhere at waist level.  This is really just unacceptable and the main reason I had to return.  Essentially, loss of primary function from a reasonable distance :(

Senso wireless headphones


I just received these yesterday and used them today. The reason for the 4 stars is because this is based on initial use. The pairing to my phone was easy and the sound was very good when talking on the phone. (I have an iPhone) They are very comfortable and the sound is great when it comes to listening to music, no crackling or too much treble or anything like that. I haven't tried running with them in yet but I'm sure they will do just fine. I like the case that they come with, they won't get squished in a drawer. They also come with a car charger. I think these are great for the money and especially for working out or mowing or anything where a cord is cumbersome. I will increase or decrease stars as I get more use from them.

OK but not as good as original


I bought this second one for my wife after having good experience with what I call the ""original"" black version. However, it seems this version is a little cheaper made - at least evidenced by the little charger flap that won't stay in place. Suggests to me lower material quality.The fit into the ear is a little different - not sure if I like it as well, but I didn't try it extensivelySo overall a little disappointed that this new model didn't do at least as well as old one, or even better, assuming that the manufacturer was really into improved quality

I don't want to spend too much on headphones since they're pretty much ""Here today, gone tomorrow"" whether they are expensive or cheap. I had a similar set that lasted almost a year. These were great, until one day they just stopped turning on, even after having charged them up. Lesson learned: stop buying these kinds of items from Amazon.

I’m new to Bluetooth headphones previously just using your standard earbuds until I just got sick of twisted tangled cords. These are a revelation and the best thing I’ve purchased in a long while. Things don’t stay in my ears well so I like the over the ear hook which is really comfortable. I wear these for 1-11/2 hours at the gym and never notice them. I can’t speak with experience about sound quality except to say they are better than your apple ear buds. Loudness is more than enough and there is some bass effect. For the money I would highly recommend

Poor bass however, I am spoiled.


This may not be a fair review because I have been using the Plantronics Backbeat 903+ for years.The good, they have multiple size earbuds.  They are excellent, stay in the ear and are very comfortable. The sound is good.  They pair with two devices and that is an advantage if you are going to use with a desktop computer.The cons, The strap across the back gets caught on the back of your neck and in your collar which pulls on your ear.  They stay in anyway.  Sound quality is not even close for music playback.  The backbeat are way louder, have considerably more bass, and deliver much greater midrange.  The SENSO has higher quality highs and give more clear sound on phone calls.  the largest complaint is the size.  Looks like a box hanging out each side of your head.  There is an annoying blue light flashing all the time aimed right at the person you are talking too.

Nice Ear Buds at first.....


Hooked these ear buds up to the TaoTronic 4.1 Transmitter/Receiver so I could watch TV. They hooked up pretty easily and I got great clear crisp sound. I turned off the TV to do a few things around the house and when I came back to go to bed I turned on the TV and put on the ear buds but got no sound. I had to re-pair the two devices, and this time when I got sound it was distorted and had a hum/hiss in the background and would cut out now and then. I tried several things to fix the problem to no avail and ended up just using my wired headphones.These are really nice comfortable ear buds and when the sound first came on it was clear and loud. I must have gotten a defective set and will be returning them. Too Bad....

Good deal for the money


After buying 2 lemmons, tried the Senso headphones and they are good. Easy to setup and had no problems with my iPhone and iPad.They come in a nice package with the accessories posted. I’ve used them in the gym, in noisy places (restaurants), and on FaceTime calls without issues.Their only flaw is the bass.If you lusten to rock music like I do they do the job, but I listened to bass heavy tunes and the lower frequencies sounded distorted. I was able to get around this with the EQ settings in Spotify so it wasn’t a big deal to me.Again, high end Bosse will sound better, but I’m comfortable with this purchase.

I’ve read many reviews before buying this, and after getting it, IT’S WORTH LEAVING A REVIEW! Ok so I don’t know where to start on how amazing these headphones are, great sound quality, a great carry case that fits charger plus headphones and extra pieces, it has a magnetic cellphone car mount, a cellphone card wallet, wire tie pieces, a charger, and 3 EXTRA PAIRS OF EARTIPS! Best part is? All that for $30, I Connor believe that! Usually these type of headphones are annoying, but these ones stay in perfectly and are really comfortable, they also have volume up and down keys on the headphones, I’m not good with figuring out distances but it’s a great distance that it can still be commected, again, great quality AND lastly, waterproof.

Won’t work past 4-6 months if you intend to sweat in them


I’ve ordered these headphone three times not because of how much i love the ease fit and quality.However after 4-6 months of everyday use there always seems to be something wrong. First time they wouldn’t charge, second time the connection between wire and headphone was poor and kept showing wires. This time the headphones are fully charged and will connect for 3 seconds and then disconnect and turn off.If you’re looking for short term Bluetooth headphones... these are great! But if you’re looking for something to last you longer I would chose a different brand.It’s a bummer because they’re my favorite headphone to run in and they are not expensive. however at this rate with the amount that I’ll need to keep buying them I’ll be spending a lot more and will invest in higher quality headphones.

There were times where the sound was great then there were times the sound was distant


Well I went with these because of the amount of reviews everyone gave it.  I have to say after reading the specs these headsets are either the earlier model or a defect.  1)  Sound quality is inconsistent.  There were times where the sound was great then there were times the sound was distant, like below CD quality (same song, same playing device).  2)  I bought these headsets for the main reason to have an all in one device to listen to music and be able to talk on the phone.  There were numerous of phone calls taken on this device and everyone told me they hear an echo of their own voice.  This happened on every call taken.  On my end I can hear the caller just fine but the echoing on the other end caused me to stop using these for calls.  Bummer because the specs on the device states these were made to take phone calls with zero interference or noise from the surrounding area.  3)  You can not tell when powering up the device is low or high on battery, but when the battery is low, my god, the device will not stop letting you know the battery is low.  That part is very annoying.  Good things about the device.  Function buttons are in good spots.  They are light weight.  When the sound is performing at it's best, they have a very nice sound to it.  Good highs and good bass.  Again, if you are looking for an all-in-one device where you can listen to music and take phone calls, this device will not be the one!

... wanted to try them as I have researched the best headphones for the best value


I received these headphones on Saturday 1/28/17 and immediately wanted to try them as I have researched the best headphones for the best value, and thought that these could not be as good as the reviews stated. They are better than I could have imagined! Right out of the box I was able to pair them to two different devices quickly and easily and the sound quality is incredible. The functionality of the buttons are easy to understand and use. The headphones are very comfortable and fit perfectly. I called my wife to see how the sound quality came through regarding the microphone and ability to make calls, and she could hear me clearly and there was no echo or interference (with the first call there was, but that was due to a poor signal, none at all on the second). I rarely post reviews for products, but in this case, I wanted to share my review for anyone that is thinking about purchasing this product, it is a fantastic buy, I could not be more pleased.

The sound is better than I expected at this price


This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. The sound is better than I expected at this price. The fit is great, they stay on, and they are easy to keep clean. I especially like the on/off button and volume control. My only complaint (mentioned by others) is wind noise while running. I tried switching the tips (included) but it did not fix it. It may be a fluid dynamics design flaw given the shape of the earpiece, but that shape also makes them more comfortable than my old wired set. If you're using these for stationary workouts, work around the house, or walking, you won't hear it. Honestly, after a while I got used to it and it didn't bother me. Overall, an excellent purchase.

I really like my Senso Bluetooth headphones! They are very comfortable and the volume range is great! There are different ear buds, so you can pick which size you like. I didn't want ear buds - I wanted over the ear headphones. The ear buds are soft and I honestly don't notice them or the over the ear loop.The whole package comes with a small round case, cigarette USB plug in, lightning USB cord, charger, ear buds (3 sizes), and the looped headphones. It's a sweet, inexpensive deal! They're perfect for me and the volume control & power knob/bump is easy to figure out & use.

Pretty good


Recently I purchased two pairs of these headphones for me and my wife. They work well enough so that you won't be disappointed. I would suggest listening to your music, using EACH of the interchangeable ear pieces.  This will allow you to find the most comfortable fit and  help you figure out which size produces the best music quality for your taste. For example: the medium size earpiece was more comfortable, but the large earpiece produced better music quality for my listening taste.  The bass was deeper and didn't sound ""hollow"". The company will follow up with an email, reminding you of the one-year warranty and will offer any assistance for  any dissatisfaction. For me, I feel comfortable knowing that.

Great -except...


This is my second pair. I thought I had lost my first pair but then found them. They both have good sound,etc. but the first pair had springy things that go around your ear to hold it in place. They worked great. The new ones had something like a stiff wire inside that I guess was meant to fold and bend around your ear for a custom fit. It doesn't work. It is difficult to make them fit, and as soon as you take them off the ""fit"" gets bent as you take them off. I think that the bendy wire will fatigue and break given time. Go back to the first version, people!

Great!


I've had these for two weeks now, and I must say I'm rather pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying them. The audio quality is good, with a rich bass, and the convenience of not snagging a cord on everything (drawer handles in particular) is such an advantage I regret not having bought a pair years ago.  The only downside is that when you have these in you can't hear anything BUT what you're listening to.  This comes in very handy when mowing the yard or working out at the gym, but when someone is trying to speak to you it's quite annoying having to remove an earpiece and say, ""What?!""  Overall, however, I love these little jewels, and would recommend them.

They hook up easily on my ears and stay put


It usually takes me about a month before I break any type of headphones. I workout hard and I am rough with them. I am also a runner in hot Florida, and sweat a lot. However, I have had these headphones for almost a year now and they work perfectly, even when I drench them with sweat. They hook up easily on my ears and stay put. They are comfortable, lightweight, and I forget they are even there. It syncs really well with my iPhone / iTunes and my Sandisk Sport Clip. The music quality is great. I have owned super expensive headphones, and these still hold up the best. I would totally recommend them.

Not the greatest...really just 'o-kay'


I really wanted these headphones to work. I work outside, and have the luxury of being able to listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, whatever I want to, while working. I bought these to replace an old, worn out pair of bluetooth earmuff type headphones.The sound quality is pretty decent, and the 'noise canceling' plugs are great. I could actually keep the volume at a decent level and still hear what I was listening to over the noise of the equipment I am operating (old headphones I had to turn volume up all the way, and depending on what I was listening to, I still couldn't hear anything sometimes).My disappointment comes from the constant 'drop' every few minutes (for lack of a better term). No matter what I am listening to, every few minutes the headphones just cut out and back again for just a second or so. It's annoying. It is not because I am going to far away from my connected device, because I am carrying the connected device in my pocket. They are always within 2 feet of each other.The second thing that disappoints me is the battery time. Perhaps all devices of the size operate the same, but these earbuds only last me 3 1/2-4 hours. I only need them to work at most, 5.One other thing I'll mention that has been said by other reviewers: the size of the plugs. If you have small ears, (I do) they will  hurt after having them on about an hour, and the 'loop' that goes over the ear doesn't even touch my ear because it is so big. The plugs are staying in because I have to cram the buds in my ears (because they are so big) and that's what keeps them in! I'm not sure how someone running keeps them in.I think I may have to return these and go back to the bulky headphones.

Looked at all the options at Best Buy, including Bose


I reviewed wireless headphones ad nauseam. Looked at all the options at Best Buy, including Bose. Read numerous blogs and Amazon reviews.In the end, I chose the Senso Bluetooth headphones, based on the reviews.I use them primarily for jogging. So far, the sound quality and the fit are both excellent. I had a minor customer service issue (that I think turned out to be my fault), and expected to hear back from Senso in 2-3 days. Instead, I received a complete reply within a couple HOURS. I couldn't believe it!Do yourself a favor and purchase these. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Easy to set up, good connection


They don't pop in my ear! Other Bluetooth headphone hurt by popping loud static in my ears but these, I'm happy to report, do not. The red case matches the red accent of the headphones. They have a pretty good reach, maybe 20 feet plus 2 walls of interference before they started to cut out. Connecting it to my phone was easy. They came with a battery charge so I could use it straight out of the box. I've used it 3x in the past 2 weeks and have not needed to recharge it. I do often click the button when placing them in my ear, but that's okay. They came with several sets of ear buds and the default is a really nice set of buds, similar to ear plugs. Excellent buy.

Finally!


Ok, so this is my fourth pair of Bluetooth ear buds that I have bought over the last several years to wear at the gym and this will be my last. These things are amazing. The problems I've encountered with BT ear buds range from sound quality, to battery life, fit and volume. They either fit good and are comfortable but sound like crap, or they sound ok but are dead after 2 trips to the gym.Senso has addressed every one of these issues. These things are amazing, I've never had BT ear buds this good. The sound quality is amazing, I've never gotten this much bass out of ear buds, not even out of my beats wired ear buds that cost $100. And the volume is crazy, these things are loud! They are extremely comfortable and stay in place, and I can get 6 to 8 hrs on a single charge. I can't believe you can get these at this price point with all the accessories included, and a 1 year manufacturer warranty...... what an awesome find. I would buy them again, let me rephrase that, I will buy these again. I'm thinking of buying a second pair for work. The reviews on these ear buds are accurate, I usually won't do reviews until less an item is really great or really horrible. Senso deserves this review, they are just simply that great.

I love these things!


They're not too expensive so it's easy to replace, the sync quickly and simply and the little case they come in to store when they're not in use is very useful. Plus, I love that the come with different sets of plugs so no matter what shape or size your ear canal is it's mos likely to fit. My first pair lasted me well over a year. I think I damaged them by placing them in my pocket with other objects instead of in their case. With that said, they still stood up to all of my workouts, so lots of sweat doesn't damage them. I'm very happy with my purchase! 5 out of 5 for sure.

and bought these headphones based on the excellent reviews on amazon


I bought these to use as running headphones. I primarily run outside. Prior to buying these headphones I was using Apple ear buds with my iphone. The kind that come with your phone. I wanted to go cordless, and bought these headphones based on the excellent reviews on amazon.com. I have never been more dissappointed with a well reviewed item.I charged the headphones as directed in the instructions. I tried them out inside and noticed that they block out sound like you are wearing an ear plug, which I guess you are in a sense. This is less than ideal for outdoor runners as it gives poor situational awareness. I need to hear cars. I tried different ear plugs to find the best fit; the headphones come with several sizes. Ultimately I found a pair that fit my ear well.Listening to music indoors at rest the sound was good. However, when I took them outside running they were aweful. There was a constant whooshing noise like air being amplified by a speaker. This is on a day without wind. No noise when I would take the headphones off. No noise when I would stop running. Constant whooshing in my ears everytime I ran.Additionally, the sound cut out with turning my head or bending down to touch my toes and stretch my hamstrings.I tried to trouble shoot the sound issues. I turned the headphones off and on again, I disconnected the bluetooth and reconnected, I adjusted the fit of the headphones in my ear. I dont think it was an issue of earbud fit: because I didnt hear a car come up behind me, yet had constant whooshing noises in my ear every time I ran. If the ear bud wasnt fitting in the ear I should have been able to hear a car around it.I am giving these headphones a 1 star review. Not a good headphone for running due to poor situational awareness, a constant whooshing air noise while running, and sound dropping off with positional movement.

Great customer service!


I love these! The sound quality is very good and the range is better than I expected - I stayed connected down a flight of stairs. Have only had these less than a week, so can't speak to their durability, but so far, so good. I would recommend them.I posted this review back in February, and unfortunately, one side glitched out about a week ago. Knowing they had a 1 year warranty, I contacted Invotek by email, explained the problem, and they sent out a new pair right away. Got them today, just 4 days later. I hope these last more than 5 months, but I feel certain their great customer service will take care of any problems I have.any in the future.

Best Money Spent!!!!!


So I wanted to wait until I was able to really test out these head phones before writing this review. It has been about a week since I received these in the mail. They arrived right when they said they would and the box was in excellent condition, which of course you expect from amazon. I was so excited after reading all the reviews before purchasing to be honest it was between these and a pair that was well needless to say WAY more expensive. I decided to take a chance on these and all I would be out would be 25 bucks and a lesson learned of you get what you pay for lol. Well let me tell you it has been well over a week since I had these and all I can do is rave about them to everyone who will listen. So let me break it down for you.PROS (AND LET ME TELL YOU THERE IS ALOT OF THEM)Firstly the battery life is AMAZING I just now charged after getting it out of the box and using it for over a week straight. Yes I used it for Netflix and Pandora at the Gym, Yes I used it for phone calls while cleaning the house, and I even used it on a hiking trip with pretty much no way to charge my phone or the headset and it still kept on ticking it even outlasted my brand new Iphone which I was extremely impressed by. So it says 8 hours of use it will give you that and probably a lot more.Secondly it fits so comfortably in my ear. Seriously this was a big consideration for me I usually hate in the ear head phones preferring my over the ear set or my gaming headset. That being said I was impressed and surprised at the range of sizes and styles it offered for fitting in one persons ear. They fit really comfortably and even after a couple hours in still didn't hurt my ear.Third They stayed on my ears! I know this goes back to the second point out fit but I decided to talk about it separate because it was important to me I was able to do high impact cardio in these without having to adjust them and let me tell you I put these to the test running, hiking, and lifting, these things stayed put no matter what I was doing.Which leads me to the Fourth thing I love about them. They are water resistant !!!!!! I mean when you work out how many of you have killed your headphones because of sweat? I know I have and these I have even dropped them in the sink. NOT SOMETHING I RECOMMEND! But they just kept on ticking. Of course I could have just been extremely lucky so don't try this at home.Number 5 on our count down of why you should buy these headphones. They are so easy to operate even my grandma could do it! They pair super easy and with all the Bluetooth enabled devices I have tried them on including my computer (HP laptop), Tablet (Ipad), Phone (Iphone), Ipod, and the husbands LG phone and my old HTC.Number 6. The Sound is great especially for the price! It is clear and has great volume controls but don't expect something like Bose sound to come out of these headphones. I could hear every lyric or word spoken and everyone who I talked to using the mic could hear me so there are zero complaints there. I could turn them up to about half way and drown out the world around me.Number 7 Charging we have already talked about battery life now lets get to charging. So I killed them it took me a week to do it but I killed them dead completely dead and plugged them into the lightening charger that came with and bam before I knew it they were at 100% in about an hour to an hour and a half for how long they last this charging time is awesome.Number 8 All the stuff they come with. So most Bluetooth head sits will come with the device and then will come with a charging cable and that is it. Well these come with different ear pieces to insure comfort, a nice carrying case to put them in, a car charger (yes you heard me right a car charger I was shocked by this myself) and two charging cables.ConsI just have one they aren't noise cancelling I cant just put them on and have the world drowned out. I read they were only passive but it was still disappointing but not a 5 star deal breaker.So over all these for the money have been the best thing I have bought in a long time! I am glad that I took a chance on these and cant be more happy with my purchase.

Headphones are very good and customer service is impeccable


First, let me comment about the seller and then I'll discuss the headphones.  These folks are amazing.  I assume the seller is a small company, and they are truly on top of taking care of their customers.  I've had two issues with the headphones (I'll discuss in the product review below).  The first time, I emailed the seller on a Friday evening around 6pm.  I assumed I'd hear from them the following Monday after the weekend.  I was wrong.  They wrote me back at 8:30 that same evening.  They were able to fix my problem via emails and I was able to use the headphones that same evening.  The second time I had a problem I emailed them again.  It was on a Sunday at 5:42 p.m.  They wrote me back that same evening.  This time they weren't able to resolve my issue but promised to send me replacement headphones.  I received them two days later - on Tuesday.  That's incredible customer service, and these guys deserve five stars just for their dedication and responsiveness.Now on to the headphones review.  I'm a runner and I bought these specifically to use while running.  I haven't used them for telephone calls or any other purpose, so these comments are completely geared toward using these headphones to listen to music while exercising and running.  I've been using them for a little over a month.  First, the sound quality.  For the price ($37), I think they sound pretty good. I was a musician in a past life, and there are definitely headphones out there that sound better.  These are by no means ""studio quality,"" but they sound very good.  Some folks on here complained about the bass being a bit heavy, but I kind of like it.  I've used other headphones that have virtually no bass and sound very metallic.  These headphones are pretty well balanced.  And, as others have mentioned, you can download an equalizer app if you really want to dial them in and EQ down the bass.  But I think they sound more than good the way they are.  You won't get audiophile sound for $37 and if that's your goal, you're shopping down the wrong aisle.You can nitpick little things all you want with any product purchase, but for $37 and all the included features, these headphones are very decent and deserve all the great reviews.  For running, I wanted headphones that were ""sweatproof,"" wireless, loud and that would stay put in my ears while running.  These headphones are all those things.  With the hook design for the ears, they rarely move around in my ears, and I've had no issues with them having to be adjusted.  The wireless is great, and I've never had an issue with them connecting to my Samsung Galaxy S8 +.  They are also plenty loud.To alleviate and fears of those contemplating making this purchase, I'll address some of the complaints I've seen in other reviews.  Some mentioned that the power button is awkwardly placed in the middle of the right ear headphone and can get pushed accidentally while adjusting the headphone. This is true.  However, it seriously only took me maybe one outing to adjust to the power button placement, and it hasn't bothered me since.  Others think the ear hooks aren't comfortable - I think they're fine.  If you're going running, the hooks are awesome.  These headphones stay put and don't move around - all because of the hooks.  I used some other ""hookless"" headphones while running the other day, and every two minutes I had to adjust them - big pain in the butt.  I've also read some complaints about the wire sticking to your neck.  That did bother me the first few runs.  I don't think this problem is unique to these headphones.  I think any similar ""wireless"" headphones will have one wire between right and left sides and that wire has to be routed.  Regardless, I figured out to simply run the wire over the top of my head.  Since I always wear a hat when I run, the wire is now under my hat and not on my neck.  If you're not wearing a hat, I also think using some Body Glide or other similar product on the wire would solve the problem.  Lastly, battery life - very acceptable as far as I'm concerned.  I almost always charge them fully before I leave the house, and I've never had an issue.  They charge very quickly, so I keep them charged.  I know I can't outrun the battery on these, and that's good enough for me.  Other folks might be concerned whether these headphones will die after eight hours or after nine hours.  I will never run long enough in one outing to find that out, so not an issue for me.Lastly, let me mention the specific problems I have experienced with these headphone.  The first time I contacted the company, it was because sound was only coming out of the left side.  They suggested I perform a ""factory reset,"" which apparently can cure a number of oddities.  Sure enough, the factory reset fixed my sound problem and all was good.  So... if you're having any weird issues with your headphones, go for the factory reset first.  It's simple to do: (1) Power them off and plug the headphones in so they are charging; (2)  While charging, hold the power button down for seven seconds.  And that's it; factory reset accomplished.The most recent problem I had with the headphones was the same issue - no sound coming from the right side.  Factory resets didn't fix the problem.  Interestingly, last night I was playing with them and now they work again.  And this morning, the replacements arrived from my Sunday email.  So I now have two functioning sets.  I can't comment on the longevity of these headphones as I've only had them for a little over a month, but I can say that the company takes their customer service very seriously.  You can rest assured that the one year warranty is not a gimmick.  Everything breaks at some point.  At least you know you can count on these guys to make things right and not leave you high and dry.  That's good enough for me.

AWESOME!!!


Though I have only used these headphones for a little while, I can already tell they are of great quality. The sound is very clear through these, also I like the audio system sync feature. This allows you to sync the phone volume with the headphones so anytime you turn down either one it controls the other as well. I have not tried to communicate with someone through the speaker, if I ever do use it I will update it here. They fit very comfortably in your ears and I feel this is because of the curved earpieces and the loop that allows it to stay snug for much longer. I have tried many different kinds and some others slide out but I never felt for one moment that these were going to slide out. I would recommend these to a friend or family member.

Affordable, great sounding in-ear option for iPhone 7


I just got these bluetooth in-ear headphones. I got these at a substantial discount from list price via Amazon. My items arrived on time and in perfect condition.I've only had them a week, but so far I really like them. I wanted an affordable in-ear, sweat-resistant option for sports/yard work, and these seem to be great.  The silicone over-ear pieces are far more comfortable for my ear anatomy than hard plastic. Set up and pairing with my iPhone 7 was easy. The sound quality is better to me than Apple's standard EarPods (I'm mostly a classical listener, so don't need the mega-bass some people want). Phone calls seem to work fine with the built-in microphone. The total package (includes a USB car charger - a nice bonus) left a great impression. I can't assess durability, but so far so good!

PICTURE IS DECEIVING


The picture is deceiving. The cord is not fixed looking as it appears in the picture of the product.  It's actually free flowing and when wearing the headphones looks wavy and unbalanced, even if the cord it straightened out and all the twists in the flat wire are taken out before placing the speakers over your ears.  So when wearing the headphones, it looks cheaply made and unbalanced. I also was not impressed with the sound quality.  I purchased the headphones due to decent reviews. No I would not recommend them at all.

Definitely worth purchasing.


For the price, these headphones are great. Good sound, sweat proof and are perfect for accompanying me on a run or at the gym. I would have given them a 5 if it weren't for a couple of things. The loops on the ear are a bit too tall for my smaller ears, so I wish they could be adjusted in some way, as well as smaller ear buds. They do come with different sizes, but I have really small ears, so I struggle with most headphones. This is not a knock on the brand at all. The other thing is that after about 7 months of use, the left earbud went out. Normally, this would be very frustrating, but I used these bad boys hundreds of hours, and abused them. Like, I would just wad them up and throw them in a pocket or bag, so I would expect even the best headphones to make it through that. But where they absolutely receive a 5-star rating is their customer service. These headphones are covered under a 1-year warranty. I told them that the left headphone went out, and they first tried to help me fix the problem myself, but after that didn't work they replaced them no questions asked. So, if you need some good workout headphones, you won't find a better product for the price, and I've tried more than a dozen different headphone (both bluetooth and not, over the ear and in ear) and these were by far the best for the money.

Great product, performance, price.  A few wishes too.


Sound quality is great!Ease of use, great.Connectivity to phone, immediate!Not a negative, but a few wishes:1.  Lots of stuff comes in the box that I already have.  While I appreciate the incredible packaging and extras, how about leaving the extras and reducing the (already low) price?2.  The earpiece cable is flat, so it can twist easily.  I'd prefer a round cable that would hold its shape and not get turned into curly's.3.  Battery lasts forever, but when you hear ""battery low"" that means you have something like 2 or 3 minutes until it just stops.  A little longer of a warning would be nice so when out running it doesn't happen to shut off well before you get home to charge it.

Love the multi-function buttons


Love being able to skip tracks by long-pressing the volume buttons. Sound is decent given how inexpensive these are. Great for the gym where it's mostly to block out background noise and play music to help pass the time. Sweatproof thus far after using them almost every day for months. Works okay for online meetings and phone calls. Not ideal for true audiophile experiences.

Searching for a pair of Bluetooth Headphones is not easy as there seems to be endless choices


Searching for a pair of Bluetooth Headphones is not easy as there seems to be endless choices. I wanted a pair that sounded great, with good bass. I scrolled and read reviews until my brain hurt. I'm also not a fan of ear clips because they start hurting my ears after awhile. But after I saw the video review and saw that the ear clips were soft and flexible, I decided to try them out. They did not disappoint, the first thing I did was sync them to my phone and picked a song. The sound was fantastic, and the fit was extremely comfortable, I could barley notice that I was wearing them. I'm sure that the Bose or Beats might sound better, but I couldn't imagine them being 100.00-150.00 better. I am real picky when it comes to sound quality, and these will do the job. You can't beat the 36.00 price. The battery life says 8 hours. Plus it comes with several extras, a really nice zippered case, extra ear pieces in different sizes, a 2-1 USB charging chord that fits Apple and Android devices, and a car charger with two USB adapter plugs. No need to read anymore reviews as this is the one you should buy. I liked these so much that the next day I bought 2 more pairs for my wife and daughter. Can't beat this Quality for the price

Bluetooth signal too weak for daily use.


Weak bluetooth reception. The sound was great as long as I held my phone (new) in my hand or outside of my jacket or pants pocket. Now my jacket is not made of lead and neither are my pants, but the constant dropping of the bluetooth signal was enough for me to return these otherwise ok earbuds. If you use your headphones while riding the bus or walking on the street and have your phone in your pants pocket or jacket pocket expect your signal to drop constantly.  This is too bad, because when the signal held steady the sound and fit were both good.

They're OK not great but OK


I work a lot outside and have tried probably a dozen types of bluetooth headphones. Just like my rating I would give them a 3 out of 5. I don't think they're all that comfortable, the piece that goes over your ear is really big and non adjustable. I would say I have an average sized head for a guy and the over the ear piece is really sloppy feeling. I think you'd have to have a very large head for them to be snug. They're also a bit bulky on the sides for what they are in my opinion. I will say these work good, sound good, and have plenty of volume. If they made the ear piece adjustable and slimmed them down on the sides i'd give them 4 stars.

Good for music, bad mic


So far I love these. They work great and they’re comfortable. The only thing that drives me nuts is when the battery gets low it tells you basically with less than a song left of battery. I wish it let you know sooner. It will literally say “battery low” and then less than 3 mins later die. The icon that shows in the upper right hand of the screen of my iPhone isn’t super accurate I’ve noticed.But they work great. I’ve been told the mic quality is pretty bad but I didn’t buy them for that. If you’re buying them to do conference calls I’d recommend a different pair or external mic.

Headphones were/are not as advertised.


“B A T T E R Y L O W”“P O W E R O F F”“P O W E R O N”When you advertise “noise cancellation,” do you mean “make these headphones as loud as possible so that our customers can’t hear anything outside of what they’re listening to and then advertise it as noise cancellation?” I only have my volume up a single tick on my iPhone and these headphones blast sound through my ears.I always get caught off guard when the headphone battery gets low. Even though I have a single tick on the volume while using these headphones, when the headphones tell me the battery is low it automatically turns the volume up to max and screams “BATTERY LOW” into my ears. If you like surprise jump scares then this product is for you.When I bought these headphones Amazon advertised this product at 200+ dollars going on sale for 80-90%. I thought I was getting a great deal and buying some top notch headphones for a tenth of the price, but actually the product was worth 20 bucks. Maybe I should’ve known better, but apparently either amazon or SENSO advertised this product as being at an extremely high discount rate to get more sales. False advertising at its finest, or maybe that might be a trend with products sold on amazon in general. How unfortunate.Now to get more into the technical side, the sound quality isn’t good or bad, which is appropriate since these headphones are only 20 dollars. They’ll get the job done. These aren’t a pair of Bose or Beats. However, when you advertise these headphones as 200+ dollars on sale for 80-90% which is the pricing range of Bose or Beats headphones, but in reality this is only a 20 dollar product, you’re expecting much more from these headphones. And obviously, since this is actually a 20 dollar product you just feel ripped off because it was advertised as really expensive.Noise cancellation as stated previously is solved by Senso by blasting sound into your eardrums until you can’t hear your environment anymore. Not noise cancellation, but nice try.tl;dr - these headphones are not as advertised because the noise cancellation is poor and sound quality isn’t good. I’m buying a new set of headphones. I’m very disappointed, annoyed, and feel cheated.

Muddy sound—great for tragus piercings


The sound is muddy and not great. I feel like I can barely hear the lyrics because the bass is SO high. That being said, I don’t mind that much because they are gym headphones, and they do sort of block out sound.On the plus side, I really like how well they stay on my ears, it’s hard to find gym headphones that stay in my ears because I have a tragus piercing. The hook is flexible, and it comes with an earplug quality earbud. I didn’t have to adjust my headphones once.I’ll keep them because I just need something to listen to at the gym that stays in, but the sound quality isn’t that great.

Not exactly waterproof


These are listed as IPX7 which supposedly means that they will continue to function in up to 3 feet of water.They do not. What they do do is _recover_ after being placed in water.I purchased these earbuds so I could listen to audio books in the tub. I did some research figured out the limitations of what IPX7 supposedly means, then figured I would give it a try. Ok, I admit I am a quality assurance tester for a living so I had to test it. I figured, seeing as they were good up to 3 feet, they aught to be fine if I laid back in my tub (max depth 1foot). The second they were fully submerged under an inch of water, they ceased functioning.Now, to their credit, when I pulled them back out they resumed functioning. Which is why this is not a 1 star review and I didn't immediately return them. That said, even when they are not submerged but are simply under the shower spray they will intermittently cut out. If left too long they will start to misbehave, triggering random buttons etc... So effectively, they can get wet, you can shake them off and they will probably be fine, but don't expect them to actually work while wet.

Good value for wireless freedom


Good value for the money. Battery lasts many hours between charges, and charging completes quickly. Many other included items, so I'm not sure how they're selling these headphones at this price...but, glad they are!  This is my first set of Bluetooth headphones (as I normally prefer wired sound quality), but I am very happy with my purchase, so far, and did not have unrealistic expectations about audio fidelity.  Some may find the overall size of these to be too big, especially if you wear a beanie or other hat that goes over the ears, but I have not had a problem with them, yet.

Product durability


So I hardly ever comment about items, however this product warrants one. To begin, I do not know the seller, and I was not paid for my comments. These head phones were bought specifically to use when I cycle. Having a heart rate monitor on, wires, dog repellant, it gets to be a royal pain in the ......... So far, these are incredible. The sound, volume control, fit and the ease of connecting to blue tooth devices have been unreal. Today I was 22 miles out on a ride and caught in a pretty good rain storm. Know to be honest I did take them off so I could here vehicles over the rain, but they did get a good soaking, and so far so good. I cannot comment on the battery life yet but as the cycling season progresses, I will include further updates. I have to say, if you are looking for earbuds give these a try. For my application, so far so good

A wonderful Bluetooth that really sounds and works well


This Bluetooth came to me well package and i finally got it to pair.  I really had a time trying to pair it with my iPhone.  I was going to send it back and purchase another brand.  But i went to you-tube and i saw what i need to do.  I was trying to pairing it from the charger and that really didn't work at all.  So i learn never pair a Bluetooth while charging it up.  Thanks for such a wonderful product.  So if you have another Bluetooth  that is made more for a truck driver, please send me information on it.  I would like to see one that i can use with out putting plugs in my ear..okThanks again it does work rather well..

You get what you pay for.


These headphones suck.  I guess that's to be expected for $30 Bluetooth headphones but I still expected more.  They skip whether I am walking or running with them which is extremely annoying.  The sound quality I would describe as adequate but not great.  To make up for the lack of quality, Senso gives you a TON of extras: case, multiple charging cords, extra ear buds, etc which really aren't necessary.  Better quality would be more appreciated.  They describe them as ""noise canceling"", but in reality I could hear plenty of street noise, more than I expected.  Going back to my Tao Tronics Bluetooth headphones. Disappointed in this product, especially based on how many good reviews they had.

Great bass, great fit, decent battery life - can't beat for twenty bucks.


I have waited a few months to write this review to see how these puppies hold up. My impressions are overwhelmingly positive. These are the best cheap headphones I've been able to find.Pros:-Comfortable, adjustable fit that actually STAYS in your ears unlike a lot of other earbuds I've tried.-Fantastic bass and decent sound isolation.  They're not ""noise canceling"" but they definitely get the job done if you're trying to ignore your mom when she's telling you to do chores.-Actually waterproof. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wore these in the shower a few time and they were totally un-phased. Which means they'll definitely be great for a run on a rainy day...once I decide to start exercising.Solid design - the large central button is easy to find and push even when wearing gloves, allowing you to pause, play, or answer phone calls with ease. Volume buttons are well placed and easy to access.Cons:Though it has excellent bass, the hi frequencies are only so-so. But...you know...twenty bucks.Questionable microphone: Sometimes people on the other end would have great difficulty hearing me even though I hadn't physically changed positions. I'm not sure if this is something that could be improved on my end so I ain't mad.

Great headphones for the price but they changed the design for the worse


My recent pair (5th pair) is my least favorite pair because they changed the design on the part that wraps over your ear to flexible vs rigid, which always loses its shape after a short period so that you have to reshape it so it wont fall out, the wire grabs your neck or chin and tugs on the ear piece causing it to lose its shape around your ear which then causes you to pause and reshape it, major drag when your running or driving, major bummer in design change. probably wont re order them because of that simple but negative change. Otherwise its a great product for the money.

Work great so far


Bluetooth has nice range. Bass is incredible if I firmly hold pressure on them into my ears. Bass is okay once I let go. I can't tell any difference as far as noise cancelling. Of course I hear less noise because something is pressed into my ears, but I can't tell that they are actually suppressing additional noise. I have not used them for any phone conversations yet, but all other features seem to work good. Battery life is good. So far I am on approx 5 hours since charging. (approx 45 mins a day at gym). For the money they are awesome

I totally love these. I opened the box


I totally love these.  I opened the box, asked my iPod to connect, within seconds, I was jamming to amazing bass.  Next, I asked my iPhone to connect, tried Pandora, amazing.  Immediate bluetooth connection.  They fit in my ear (buds) and around my ear perfectly, couldn't be happier.  Perfect for workouts or anywhere.  I haven't tried phone calls yet, but have had one week and these are over the top.  The price is in line for quality received.  Come with a portable carrying case, car charger, extra ear bud pads and more.  Love, love, love.  Oh, and I got an email from the company president, Kenneth Bastrom to follow up on satisfaction.

Sound is great at certain volume bass is great but sounds weird when too loud.


The sound quality was great but it started to sound really weird with bass. Noise cancellation is okay but when you have them like right inside your ear but it never really seems to stick well. I always feel like I have to adjust them for some reason. It feels odd wearing them. The part that goes over your ear is very flexible but feels weird. It seems to always be mois or oily I guess it's just how my ears are especially when working out it can be hard to adjust and stay on.

Stopped working after a month


Purchased these headphones a month ago and was pretty happy with them.  I purchased them to use with my peloton, they connected easily and the sound was pretty good.  They weren't very comfortable but I was getting used to them.  Last week I plugged them in to charge and when I came back to use them there was no power indicator light and they would not turn back on.  Seems as if they just died while charging.  I called Senso support and they just told me to return them.  Pretty disappointing, probably won't be buying another pair.

Good price, too many accessories, poor audio quality.


They work so far, however, the audio quality is noticeably worse than most other headphones I've tried. The bass scrubs out easily on any modern recording, and That's very disappointing. Maybe if they focused on quality of the product instead of the quantity of the accessories, this wouldn't be a problem. Noticeably worse than most headphones of the same type. On button placement is on the side of the right, and is very easy to press when adjusting volume, and interrupts listening experience. I'm probably going to send these back for a different set, or keep this set as a cheap backup pair.

Great product for this old man


As an old man (60 yrs of age); I'm still old school and I'm slowly getting into the 20th century.  Two years ago my son recommended I get a Smart Phone and in some way my world expanded.  However I still used a MP3 player for my music and was reluctant to use my S5.  Well I finally caved in but wanted to get wireless bluetooth headphones.  Well my son naturally sync the both devices. I listed to my music on the S5 and it was GREAT!  Answering calls was very easy.  Purchasing these Senso Bluetooth Headphones was well worth the money.  Outstanding Product!

BEST FREAKING HEADPHONES EVER. *update*


Hands down the best freaking headphones ever. I could not ask for more. Bass is amazing, mic is clear and just amazing in every way possible.*update*I have had these headphones for 2 months, within this two month range I have used them nearly daily for 2 hours on average. The left earbud stopped working unfortunately, although that may not be because of the actual product. I tried to be gentle with them and take good care of them which I succeeded in but regardless I was rather rough with them and thats normal for me with headphones, I called up the number on the FREE 1 year warranty card and they tried to fix the problem. First time they fixed it for about a day but then it stopped again and I called them up and they said ""No problem, we will send you another pair. We apologize for the inconvenience"". Now that just struck me because they first tried to help and then they sent me another pair within a minute, talk about amazing customer service. Side note I went swimming with these on which could have caused them to stop working, yes they are waterproof but I feel like they are more of serious amounts of sweat proof not fully submerged in water. So it may have been a user error, don't go swimming with them on XD But I still do highly recommend these basically power beats 3 headphones.

Too good to be true! And yet, it's true!


I've got original Beats solos.  These beat the Beats with a bass beat that kills.  No, Im not paid to five this review. Got them with apeed.  Packaging is premium.  The earbuds themselves have a weight sturdiness to them that says quality.  My little nephew has powerbeats. These beat those beats in power. Crisp connection, steady feel on the ears.  We'll see how they handle sweat over the long run as I typically do to 5k's a week.  Let's see what happens.  Ilove the charge cable, and they provide a car charger with dual usb ports. They have their own zip case.  I'm ordering my wofe and my daughter their own pair.  These babies rock.  I find no fault yet.

Excellent customer service.


I am very pleased with both the product and Senson's customer service.When the earburds first arrived my first impressions were good build quality, comfortability (the default earbuds can be a bit snug, but the kit comes with different types of earbuds for your choosing), and nice design (cord has no controls, and therefore no uneven weight, on it. Controls location on right earbud which I like).At first I think the sound was alright... but somewhat muddy, like I was listening to music from another room. The bass was impressive, but mids and hi's were muddled. I reached out to customer service and they fixed my problem as so:""We are sorry to hear that you are not fully satisfied with the audio of your headphones. We care about your experience with us, and we are committed to ensuring your satisfaction as one of our valued customers.The Senso ActivBuds are designed to produce a high fidelity HD sound with balanced bass accents. Please make sure there is no signal interference around the areas where you use your headphones from other devices or equipment. Signal interference can deteriorate the Bluetooth signal which may cause the audio to deteriorate.Also, there may be a calibration issue with the headphone you received. Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.Here are the instructions for resetting the headphones:1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.Also, the headphones may not connect to your devices after you perform the reset. The previous connections that you had established between the headphones and your devices become ""obsolete"" after the reset and needs to be re-configured. In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again. In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices. Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device. Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.""Fixed it right away, thanks Senso!

Would be good if they lasted


These were great headphones most of the time. Good sound quality, complete noise cancellation,  ok fit, decent battery. One side stopped working after 8 months use -no sound whatsoever.  The other side continued to work but the mic became staticky to the listener. The fit isn't great for jogging or exercise... a quick head turn causes the slack to catch and can pull one of the buds out. They also require a frequent wipe down as they get sweaty. Two stars due to early failure with routine use and poor fit.

This is What You're Looking For!


I recieved a Pixel XL phone for Christmas, and it's awkward to have a headphone jack on top of the phone, so I set out to find good Bluetooth Headphone. After a decent amount of research and reading customer reviews I decided to try these Senso Bluetooth Headphones.... The price and reviews drew me in, and honestly at the Amazon Price, I wasn't expecting much. Opening the box, I was blown away by the amount of goodies that came with the headphones.... Two separate charging cables, a car charger, a high quality carrying case, and of course the headphones themselves.The headphones are fairly lightweight, fit gently around my ears and play music well. The battery life is impressive, and overall they're very simple to use. About a year ago I got a pair of Samsung Level U Bluetooth Headphones but they came with a collar attached.... The collar always felt heavy and awkward.... These Senso headphones are the exact opposite.... I find that I forget that they're still on. The sound quality is very good.

Very durable daily headphones you won't regret


Iv'e bought three of these headphones over the past year.  Not because they have broken, but rather I keep one at the office and one in my gym bag and the other at home.  Music is a huge part of my life and these have held up with no issues even though I use daily.  I usually have these in my ears for multiple hours a day so they are very comfortable round your ears and stay in place.  At the gym no issues, they don't fall out.Sound quality is great, especially when comparing to your Beats or Bose wireless headphones that cost more than double.  The music sounds just as good in my opinion.  If your hesitant about buying these because of the price don't be.

Not Enough Sizes?


These earphones sound great when the earbud is pushed inside of the ear canal but no matter what I do I cannot get them to stay. Maybe I have very small ear holes because even the small size will not stay inside. Within 10 seconds of walking on the treadmill they have slipped out and no attempts at adjusting them makes them stay in place. At least they do stay on my ears with the over-hear hooks but the sound is nothing like having the buds inside my ears. The bass almost completely disappears. This has been an issue for me with all earbuds but since these were made specifically for use when exercising I thought they would be different.

Bad Bluetooth Connectivity


Headphones are comfortable, the mic to make calls is very good and they don't fall thanks to the rubbery half loop but connectivity has always been bad. I've had this for a while and I've been patient wondering if the poor connectivity was due to interference or where I was, but after trying them in every possible location w my iPhone 7 I concluded I will get rid of them. The headphones beep constantly as the Bluetooth connection is lost and regained. I use other devices connected to my phone via Bluetooth and never have a problem...so this set of headphones are going to the garbage.

There are better options out there


Battery life is around 6 hours. I'm a heavy user so this isn't very long. It always seems to be dead when I most need it. Furthermore, you can't charge and use at the same time which is somewhat of an inconvenience. Sound quality is good but not impressive. Holy hell is the functionality ANNOYING. Takes forever to turn on sometimes, I'm pushing a finger into my ear like an idiot waiting for the bluetooth lady to yell ""POWER ON"" into my ears. And sometimes when I'm trying to power down at night she'll go ""LAST NUMBER REDIAL"" while I scramble to find my phone to cancel a 2AM call to my ex girlfriend. Jesus. I don't want all that.

Works well and I'm well satisfied


I bought these for working out. It comes with a great zippered carry case as well all the adapters you will need for charging. The buttons are basic and simple. It paired quickly and well with my android phone. There is an audible cue to let you know the device is on. Sound quality has been excellent without any issues so far. I have yet to drain the battery. It advertises 8 hours of continuous use and the longest I have used it continuously is about 5 so far.It comes with ear buds to resize for comfort.So far the only downside I have found (which I believe is just a part of getting used to this earphone set) is having it get pulled out/off my hear while exercising. The loop around for your ear is soft and flexible.

Good sound quality headphones, But falls short to stand the test of time.


This product could of easily be a 5 star product. My main problem with Senso is that their products don't stand the test of time. Once one of their headphones hits near the 1 year warranty mark or right after, the product is at risk of malfunctioning or having it's life being cut short and no amount of charging can resurrect it back to life. I'm being a bit generous by giving this product 3 stars. This is my 3rd headset and 2 months in, the left headphone bud has a slight decrease in sound. This impacts the quality tremendously for this model in particular because of it's emphasis on it's bass quality. I really wish Senso can enhance their products to be more durable and sturdy against time. I'm not asking for decades long Toyota like quality, but at least until I can get around the proper expenses of having the budget for a new headphone. The quality is amazing in these headphones and are a great investment as oppose to burning your wallet in an open flame for the sake of some beats headphones. I just wish for better longevity.

Did not like


I bought these several months ago and was going to return but now I lost them. I really didn’t like these at all. Sound was tinny which I could have handled. But they don’t stay in my ears. I think if you’re just walking maybe they would as long as nothing pulls on them. Jogging on treadmill - the heavy side that has the volume thing will pull the other side out of your ear. And when you start to sweat same thing. Then I tried to use them mowing the lawn. Nope. Falling out. Waste of money for me but maybe it’s my ear shape. :-)

Amazing customer service


I've had these headphones for under an hour and already believe they are beyond worth the money because of the quality of the product and the customer service. They sound great, and fit very well and comfortably. They cancel noise pretty well in my limited experience with them. I've yet to test the waterproofing but may make an edit in the future about it. The main reason I leave a 5 star review is because of the impeccable customer service. I contacted Invotek through Amazon and got a response on how to fix a problem I had with the headphones and the response answered a couple questions of mine. I got this response no more than 20 minutes after I sent my email. The issue was not fixed on my headphones, but new ones will be sent immediately because of the 1 year warranty. I am in disbelief how quickly my problem was taken care of and I cannot wait for my new headphones to come.As for the issue I had. The left earpiece very quietly buzzed while music was playing. I believe this is a rare problem and will update my review when my new headphones come on if the issue is still there.Highly recommend these headphones. I plan to shower while listening to music with these. And also work out with these. They definitely sound great for the price

The best headphones I've ever had


This is my first pair of wireless (Bluetooth) headphones and man I will never go back. I've only had these a few days but I love them so much, this is definitely one of my favorite purchases I've made in a long time. The sound quality is awesome, they are super comfortable, easy to control the music, volume and pause/play from the earpiece and really convenient while running, boxing and lifting weights. All my many previous pairs of headphones would inevitably mess up in some way over time from the internal wires coming loose and result in one earbud going out, or needing to bend the cable in a certain way for it to work- I'm hoping since these aren't attached to my phone they won't have the occasional pulling that sometimes happens which over time loosens the internal connections. I got these for daily use while exercising and will update if any problems arise in the future after more wear, however these seem high quality so I have high hopes.

It's cheap, but it's also poor quality


I had a feeling the reviews were bound to be too high because these headphones are so affordable. Let me start by saying it's a great deal, to be fair.The quality is pretty incredibly poor though. I have substantial crunch in my ears from the bass at very low levels. I guess it's okay if you're listening to songs without bass, but I bought these for the gym. Not to mention the charging flap on the headphones is incredibly flimsy, I almost want to just yank it out because it gets dislodged so easily.All in all, good for a cheap pair of headphones, but awful if you care about the quality of sound.

Great replacement for Skullcandy Dime Blacks


For 7 months I used Dime Blacks. They would not last through a 3 hour podcast. They weren't very loud and the volume would not change. Wouldn't stay in my ears if I bent over regardless of the size dome I used. So I gave these a try. What an improvement. They stay on my head no matter what. Mid volume on these is plenty loud. I've never reached the end of the battery so 5 plus hours so far. They are a very good value for a low prices set of ear buds for active people.

For the price you can't go wrong!!


A while back i bought the Jabra pulse earbuds - bluetooth @ $199  The battery only lasted the max 3 hours and when i tried to turn the Jabra earbuds off i didn't receive an acknowledgement so maybe that was the cause of the battery life.  The SENSO bluetooth headphones are quality headphones.  They wrapped around my ears securing so they will not fall out; sound quality was equal to the Jabra earbuds; and the ackownledgement turning the on and off was absolutely clear and to the point.  Unlike the Jabra set the multifunctional button was useful.  The only reason i bought the SENSO is because the Jabra battery died and I couldn't afford to buy another set for $100-200.  Don't be judgemental on the price tag of the SENSO headphones @ $19.94 from amazon, they're quality.  Since I've received my SENSO I've used them for a short time (2 weeks) - used them on 3 run and my 2 bike rides while listening to music.  However, I have not used them for my calls as of yet.  I totally recommend anyone to buy them for under $20.

Good Value, But Poor Sound Quality and Wind Noise


If you look closely at some of the other reviews you'll see a trend of people commenting about the poor sound quality of these headphones. I unfortunately didn't listen to them because there so many other reviews that praise everything about these headphones!Here's the simple truth: These headphones, though an amazing ""value"", simply do not measure up in the sound quality department, which I kind of feel is the most important one. The bass is way too amped up and overpowering (not in a good way), the mids are muffled and the overall clarity of sound is pretty poor.I've had these headphones for about six months, but the poor sound quality was immediately apparent. Yes, you can adjust the sound with your phones EQ to reduce the bass and it will improve things somewhat, but they still won't sound that good. Plus, anytime you listen to your phone in your car or on any other device, the sound will be all out of whack unless you go back into settings and readjust everything.This is like buying a smartphone that has long list of impressive features, but can't actually make a phone call. Yes, it still has value because of the many other features it provides, but the most essential one you bought it for is terrible. If you think about it, it just doesn't make sense!The other glaring problem is the annoying amount of whistling and wind noise I hear while jogging, even at a very slow pace on completely still days. This is something I've never experience with any other set of earbuds I've run with. The shape of these Sensos is not very streamlined with the sides of the headphones sticking out a good bit from your ears. I have noticed if I turn my head to the side while running, the wind noise is reduced quite a bit. However, running with your head turned to the side is a not a solution.Besides these two problems, these are really a great set of headphones. Good build quality, battery life, and value for the money.However, if you care at all about the quality of your sound experience while working out, then I would look elsewhere.

Headphones Stopped charging


I had purchased these headphones for running and gym workouts and for the price you really cannot beat the quality. I lost my first pair, but was so impressed I decided to repurchase the headphones.The second pair were working great for a few months without issue. However, I left without charge for about 2-3 weeks and at which point when trying to use the headphones would not recharge. I plugged the headphones for days hoping they would charge, but no luck. I have used different chargers without success.When replacing these headphones I would go with a different supplier.

Best $20 bluetooth headphones you’ll find


I bought these with pretty low expectations, and I was very pleasantly surprised by them. I got them for working in a greenhouse where I was moving around a lot and needed the freedom of bluetooth. Our greenhouse was pretty big and I never had any issues with the range (I always left my phone on the charger). They come with a lot of accessories that most don’t. I have really small ears and have never been able to wear in-ear buds, but these stay in my ears with very few issues, even when I’m sweaty. They have a pretty decent battery life as well as a very common charger type. My 5 star rating is comparing them to others in the same price range, so I’m not saying they are as good as an expensive set. I would 100% recommend these to anyone who wants the convenience of Bluetooth without sacrificing quality or their bank account.

Best headphones I own


Just received them so I can't commit on long term physical sturdiness. First impression, was impressed with the quality of the packaging and the extra items (charger and cords) that came with the headphones. I don't consider myself an audiophile so I was confused when I saw some reviews complaining about the sound quality, was surprised after pairing with my iphone SE and placing them in my ears, the sound quality to me was much better that expected and I didn't have to turned them up loud at all. I found that during my walk the headphones had no issues with staying put and were very comfortable. I'm glad I bought two pair grey/black for me and red/black for my wife which she loves. For less than $37.00 a piece, the ability to skip/repeat recorded music and take/make phone calls, I'd say these are a slam dunk.

Terrible bluetooth connectivity


I bought these so that I could listen to podcasts and audiobooks while I take my dog for a walk.  I've used these everyday for the past week that I've had them and these headphones are a major disappointment.  Whether I keep my iPod in my pocket, in my bag, or even in my hand, the sound cuts in and out constantly as I'm walking.  It really only stays connected if I am perfectly still.  It even cuts out if I'm standing still and just turn my head to the side.  It's also difficult to hear the sound on a mildly windy day.  These headphones would only be satisfactory if you were indoors sitting down, had your phone/iPod lying flat on a table within 2 ft of you, and you kept your head facing in one direction the entire time.  I'll probably keep these for when I travel on the train or in a plane since that's when I'll be stuck in one position for long periods of time.  And I'd be totally fine if I lost these while traveling.

Pair these with an Mpow transmitter for Treadmill running


I use these primarily while running on my treadmill to listen to my big screen TV.  I paired it with a compact Mpow Bluetooth 4.1 tranmitter/receiver (around $25) that plugs in the TV audio jack.  If you do not have a single audio jack on your tv you can buy a cable that converts the two  left and right audio out cables into a sigle audio out cable that the Mpow can plug into.  I use the Mpow on the transmitter setting to send out the TV sound to the headphones.  The sound timing is dead on with the TV video- no lag.  I am very happy with these and use them almost every day.  I also bike outdoors with these paired with my iPhone.  Also, took the SENSO headphones and the Mpow on a business trip and plugged them into the Hotel treadmill which had a built-in TV and it worked great - no more hanging headphone wires that you occasionally knock loose while running.  Great price, great product.

Great Value at this price


Bought them for $20:Great Value at this price.  It came with a dual lighter USB plug for your car, Iphone charging cable, and a charging cable for the device.  The acessories alone could have cost $20.  The sound quality is above average.  The two earbud sit heavy on your ears but the wrap around ear pieces keep the earbuds stable and in place.  I have used them with up 20ft of distance between the device and earbuds without any issues.Edit:  Earphones batteries died out, but the seller honored their warranty and they where quick in responding.  Buy with confidence!!

Fantastic value


Just got these today to listen to music, podcasts and Netflix at the gym. I've had wired headsets that keep getting caught on the gym equipment- what a pain. I'm using the foam ear pieces and they feel very comfortable and don't fall out.So- just charged these up and am blown away by the sound quality sound. Nicely balanced base, mid-range and high end. Not perfect but way better than what I expected for a $20 pair of earbuds. I was going to buy the Beats but no way are they 10X better.Off to listen to more music and a workout.

Incredible value!


I so rarely rave about a product I thought perhaps I was incapable of doing so. No longer! These SENSO headphones are incredible. Mine arrived charged, so pairing took all of 15 seconds. At the end, the headphones announced ""Connected,"" and I was off. It comes with small, medium and large earbuds, a mini-to-USB cable, a dual cigarette lighter charge for the car, and a very cool cable with a mini plug that fits into a Lightning  plug, giving it dual charging capabilities. And to top it off, there is a hard case for storing these tiny wonders.The sound is crisp and clear, and for $30 I can't imagine a better deal anywhere.

Working well. Comfortable. Suite the purpose for which I bought them.


I can't comment on noise canceling or moisture wicking. I bought these earbuds so I could answer phone calls while I'm moving around the house or somewhere where the phone can be near me. I'm tired of holding the phone up to talk into the speaker and really don't like holding it up to my ear anymore. So far, so good. I like the earbuds; they're comfortable to wear and I can hear my callers well. For what it's worth, I love the nifty case they came with. That's quite an extra bit of swag for the money.

Great Value


I bought these as dedicated audible book headphones for my Kindle PaperWhite. The idea was to have a ready device for middle of the night listening on a budget, so I wasn't expecting audiophile quality and to be sure they aren't that, but I have since connected them to my laptop and smartphone with surprising results! The sound quality rivals a pair of Samsung Level-U for which I spent several times more. Battery life could be better, my experience being between 5 and 6 hours depending on volume level. The upside is that recharge occurs in about an hour and a half. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase because of the relative value.

Loud and clear sound.


The head phones came in a nice box with easy to follow instructions.  Therr were 3 sets of plugs, plus a foam set similar to ear plugs(guess for noise canceling/dampening).Used them at my gym once and was very happy with the sound volume and quality.  Did have some interference issues but that's most likely due to other equipment used in the gym.  Couldn't go more than 10 feet before the sound cut out some.  I tested them at home and could go about 30 feet before any issues.Overall I'm very happy with them.  Did not have issues with them falling out or when I got sweat on them.

Exceeds price point expectations!


First off, there is 0 noise cancelling in this device. It is an earbud that has a mic that is all.The sound is pretty good for what it is. I wear them while running and get a lot of wind noise somewhere on the device.The battery life is about 4-6 hoursIt comes with a case but I wish the case was hard because they get activated often with random pressure due to the case and their shape. If it were a hard case this would be eliminated. I wouldnt recommend storing in a pocket or bag.Definitely a good buy for workouts.

Enjoyable while they lasted


First, the good news. These headphones sound nice and I am particularly appreciative of the different size ear buds that come with the headphones.Now the bad news. The Bluetooth connection is quite poor, they stopped working entirely after only two months of use. And even before they died completely I noticed that the music would blotch out if I just turned my head away from my phone. Also, I didn't like the shape of these headphones; it caused the wind to catch them and make the music inaudible except at very high volumes. This same thing hasn't happened with my new pair which has a more sleek design that doesn't catch the wind.

....while the sound is good, I have bluetooth connection issues


I’ve had these for a few weeks now and while the sound is good, I have bluetooth connection issues.The sound is balanced and can get fairly loud, there is no excessive bass, so if Rap/Hiphop is your thing then I wouldnt get these. It plays rock and alternative as well as audiobooks really well though.The battery life I’ve clocked at around 6.5 hours  with the volume at 50%. The fit is secure and comfortable for me while at the gym and on my bicycle.The Bluetooth connection. When I first got the headphones I noticed that randomly I would hear the sound pop in and out like it loses signal for a second or so. After weeks of testing I can make it happen pretty reliably by…1) approaching my car (2006 Lexus with no Bluetooth but with keyless entry) with the phone in my pocket.2) covering the right ear bud assy with my hand while wearing it. I found this while I was try to figure out the volume buttons.There are random times it happens too while out and about on my bike, Its slighting annoying. It happens on my iPhone 6 and my friends galaxy s7. I have another cheap insignia headphone that this does not happen with.Ultimately I’m keeping them cause they are comfortable and water resistant

Best bluetooth headset I could find for the money


Best bluetooth headset I could find for the money.  It's not hard to find sets over $100. I use these for jogging and have little issue with keeping them in, maybe occasionally re-adjust them.  Battery last a long time I think. I'll go on several runs without recharging them. I've had no issues with them connecting to my iphone.I feel it does take a little getting used to wearing them, but they've never caused me any pain. Only downside I've experienced is when it's windy. Due to their size and shape, it really captures the wind to the point it sometimes drowns out the music. But on an average day they're just fine.

They are as good as advertised


They are as good as advertised.  I had fairly modest expectations. I bought them to use with Samsung Smart TV. I need more volume than my wife does. I am absolutely delighted. She controls volume with the TV remote. I can control volume separately with the volume buttons on the SENSO.  We can mute the TV and I can still hear through the earbuds.  Relative to the range, I am writing this from our computer in a separate room of my home down a hallway with a wall in between. I can hear perfectly.  They are easy to sync with my Samsung Smart TV with built in Bluetooth.I am totally happy and delighted with these. They completely meet my need and expectation.

The sound is as good as normal earbuds, and they don't hold much of a charge, but overall they worked okay for about a month of intermittent use, with only occasional stuttering when first connecting, at the edge of Bluetooth range, or when the batteries were low.Now, though, they stutter about every fifteen seconds. Batteries fully charged, phone two feet away with no obstructions, but they're absolutely useless, unless you're nostalgic for the ""badly scratched CD"" music listening experience.Wish I could return them.

Not bad for about $20. Sound and materials' quality could improve


I bought them in March 2017. For about $20 these have been a good pair of headphones that remained in good condition for about 4 years. They pair fast with my smartphone, the Bluetooth has a good range of distance - close to 20 meters. Despite not having the best sound quality, it's not horrible for an inexpensive product. I mostly use them for the gym, the sound is ok and isolates the environmental noise. I only give it 4 stars because recently the silicon around the left earbud started peeling off the cables which are now visible. I am now trying to fix them with some Sugru but also thinking that they don't have much more lifespan left. For this reason, when window shopping for a new pair, I will also consider other brands even if I have to pay a bit more. I would recommend the manufacturer to improve the product's materials.

B+ headphones with D- longevity


Good sound and microphone for calls, fit is a little loose but they never fall out, I find the (hard) plastic part that goes almost in my ear to be a little large and that can be painful sometimes if I wear them for a long time but I'm finicky. Battery life is good although the low battery notification is a bit annoying.All of this is totally acceptable for the price, but I am very disappointed that after 1 year and 2 months of ownership they have stopped working. (I think perhaps a connection broke, because one headphone is fine and the other one fuzzed out and eventually stopped working over about 3 days.) My use was pretty normal wear and tear, I kept them in the same small pocket in my purse during my commute.

Totally reasonable.


Use: running and while working. In rain performed well. Soft-plastic buds with varying sizes gives a good fit.Cost: idealBattery life: excellentSound: good. Nice bass response.Controls: good for volume only.Use with phone: some reports of slight echo.Cons: Some wind-noise as with anything. The lowest volume is a tad louder than I prefer. ""Sound cancelling technology"" is simply a tight mechanical fit and does not cancel sound in the engineering sense of producing sound waves that are the reciprocal of ambient acoustic noise. The mechanical nature is fine and I knew this before purchasing. I personally don't like marketing teams that assume customers are idiots... but then again... most of us are.Overall: completely solid set. Excellent value. Completely recommend for active runner (5-10 miles/day).

I own a JBL headset but they are a lot to carry around when traveling or at work. So I wanted Bluetooth earbuds to wear at work, home and travel. After looking and reading what's on the market as well as many reviews, I chose Senso earbuds.Received them as promised ando gave them a test, and two hours later I was certain they were Amazing.Great sound, clear and crisp. Great base and treble and everything going in between. And yhey are comfortable as well.Received an email from the company asking how I liked my purchase.

Do not stay on woman's ear


I'm giving them two stars because they did not fit me at all, although the sound quality was good. I am a female and thought I had pretty normal sized/even slightly large ears, but these do not stay on! The part that comes around the ear did nothing to hold it in place and comes up too high. If I wanted it to stay on, I had to use the smallest bud option and jam the earbud into my ear (and then the sound quality isn't good any more either and it's very uncomfortable). The part coming around your ear is more comfortable than other pairs I've tried, but that's probably because it barely touches my ear. I will be returning them.

Such a disappointment


I purchased these for working out as well as helping me with sleep issues. I have music or podcasts on a timer so I can sleep without interrupting my husband. The largest issue is the battery. As soon as it hits 50% (as indicated by the battery icon when connected to Bluetooth) it start blaring an incredibly jarring BATTERY LOW every minute. The last 50% is quickly drained and BATTERY LOW keeps cutting through any audio you are listening to. Or, in a couple cases, a no longer deep sleep It takes about 7-10 minutes of repeated BATTERY LOW interruptions before the earbuds die compleatly so I don't know how much of that is the battery percentage being inaccurate or the constant BATTERY LOW interruptions between audio. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Not worth the headache.

I purchased their headphones in October 2019, I contacted customer support as my headphones became defective in one ear and after following the directions support offered the product was still defective in one ear bud.  It was still under warranty and for the past month they have ignored multiple attempts to contact them about a replacement or workarounds to get the product working as the product has a one year warranty and still under warranty.  I bought a pair of headphones from them in 2016 and their support was much better than so I repurchased another pair in 2019 and was disappointed with the customer support provided.

These blow the Powerbeats 3 away!


These earbuds are amazing! I’ve owned them since nov 2016 and never had one problem. I’ve recently purchased beats studio 3 over ear headphones and Powerbeats 3 earbuds and these blow both of them away. These have better bass way more volume and just plain sound better in every way. They are way more comfy than either of those. I also paid 377 dollars for Bose quiet comfort qc 35 II and those made my ears extremely hot after 30 mins and put pressure on your head. These 30 dollar ear buds blow all of them away in every way. I only have to charge em once a week also. I’ve never had any connection issues once. As soon as you turn them on their connected instantly. The Powerbeats 3 I had to reconnect everytime I turned them on and off even tho I use Apple phone and they have that Apple chip. If you want some great sounding buds n wanna save a ton of money I’d but these. They came with so many accessories and a way better case than the 200 dollar Powerbeats also I could go on forever but trust me I know what I’m talking about. The Powerbeats 3 buds had not enough volume or bass these blow them out the water!

Defective headphones...but great service!


I like the way these headphones fit and sound, unfortunately, after about a month of use they stopped working well.  They work for about an hour after being fully charged, then they shut off.  I might have just received a defective pair, but when I went to return them it said my option to return was over.  I've only had them for a little over a month, so naturally I'm a little disappointed.  I'm hoping I can get a hold of someone to replace them.  If they would replace them for me with a working pair, I'm sure I'd give them a 5 star rating.So, I want to update my review of this product. I was disappointed when I received a defective pair of headphones and couldn't return them, because I was a few days too late. Fortunately, Amazon has great customer service and when I called in they extended my time to return this product.  I received my money back as soon as I dropped the defective headphones off at UPS. I bought them again with my returned money.  I made sure to register the new ones and I am excited to try these out again. I'm hoping for better results this time.  My sister has absolutely loved her pair, so I'm feeling hopeful that they will work this time.

Quality product. Exemplary support. Big smile on my face.


I tried the ActivBuds on the strength of the ratings here. I have not been disappointed.The sound quality is quite good for an earbud this size. They fit in the ear well and the over ear hook is soft and comfortable. It holds the earbuds in place. I have no suggestions for improvement.My pair suddenly stopped playing in the left bud and cut in and out in the right. I went to the Senso site and left an email for support. I was quite surprised to have a response back the same day. The suggestion was to reset the buds to factory settings then re-pair with the devices. This worked perfectly. The response promised to replace the buds if the reset didn't work. The instructions were concise, well-written, thorough, and easy to follow. I was surprised by and well pleased with the quality of support.

It's an absolute steal for what you're getting.

I love these earphones and highly recommend them for anyone -- I use them while working out, cleaning the house, and walking around town.PROS: Great fit (comes with multiple different ear pieces so you can pick whichever suits you); surprisingly great noise cancelling; fits securely; appears to be waterproof? (I don't soak it in water or run in the rain, but it works despite my sweat?); great battery life; good Bluetooth connectivityCONS: The cover for the USB charger can sometimes be a pain to pull off

Great sound, perfect fit!


The sound coming out of these were amazing, clear with just the right amount of bass. I have worn them for about 10 hours so far and even though they never died on me, I charged them at about the 6 hour mark so I can't tell how long they would have lasted. These are my first Bluetooth headsets so I was really pleased that they did not once lose connection and they pair with my phone rather instantly.I wear these when I go running and the reason I gave them a 4 is because of the wind noise which if on a very windy day I would suggest not wearing these at all, the noise is so load that you cannot hear the music. I wish these were aerodynamically designed to cut through the wind. I will say that one of the reason's I bought them is because many reviewers said that they fit very nicely in the ear. From what I experienced, they were right. I have had several pairs of headphones where many of the reviewers would say they bought them because they fit nice only to find out that for me, that wasn't true. When I run, I normally run trails for about 2-4 miles and I find it extremely rare that I have had to push these Senso headphones back into my ear....that was a big plus for me.

Bluetooth signal is a bit weak, but overall a decent bluetooth headset for the price.


I typically avoid earbuds because they never stay in my ears. I was interested in these due to the earpieces. When I use the smallest earbuds, it fits perfectly in my left ear. However, my right ear canal is apparently smaller than my left ear as even the smallest size barely fits. But, they haven't fallen out/off yet which is more than I have been able to say for any other earbud I've tried.The sound quality is about what I expected, given the price - if you aren't paying top dollar for bluetooth headphones, don't expect amazing sound quality. They aren't exactly noise cancelling, but that is perfectly fine with me. I wore them when I went for a walk and I could still hear cars and the like - which is actually a very good thing. But quieter noises (like other people talking) were inaudible until I took one of the earbuds out.The one downside I've noticed so far is that the bluetooth signal is a bit weak. I habitually wear my purse on my left side. However, the receiver for the headphones is in the right earpiece. The bluetooth signal kept cutting out intermittently until I moved my purse to my right side. I've had bluetooth headsets before and they've never had this problem, albeit they weren't earbud-style. Perhaps it's just a limitation of the size of the receiver, but it makes it very awkward for people like me who keep their phones on their left side out of habit/comfort.Edit: I went for a short bike ride with it on some local trails - there was so much wind noise that I could barely hear my music. I've had similar problems on very windy days (I live in a part of the country where high winds are fairly normal). If you're only planning to use it indoors, such as in a gym, it's a great headset. But otherwise? Not that great. I am returning it as it doesn't fit my needs.

Stop looking, buy these!!


I bought two..one for my boyfriend and one for me. I am a very frugal spender. I couldn't believe I was paying 35 $ for some headphones,but you know what? No regrets. Easy hook up. Last OVER 8 hours (which means they last longer than my cell phone.) I am getting my money's worth cause i wear them everywhere. Dunno if so far they are water resistant, but they say they are, and sweat proof. If not ill change my rating later. But these are a must buy AND a great gift. I never leave comments. But the president sent the most diligently, meaningful email asking me too. If I see this companies name on anything, I trust it and will buy it no questions asked. When you finish reading my review go ahead, click and order. Cause I couldn't wait for ours to arrive. Enjoy! I know I do.Jerrica

Overly bass heavy


Pairing and controls are super easy and a breeze.  My only concern is that these earbuds have a MASSIVE bass bump to them.  If you’re a fan of bass these will work fine. But if you music has any bass guitar or heavy big kicks be warned since they will over exentuate the bass frequencies, almost to an inaudible state. If on iPhone simply put an EQ on your music “Treble Booster” to counter balance the overload of bass.  Other than that comfort is quite good and the case and accessories are a big plus.  Just don’t get these for their high quality clear sound, they’re good as a beater set of headphones.

Good sound, battery, don't stay in my ear well.


Bought these because of the pricing offered during a daily special deal.  I have a hard time keeping headphones to stay in my ears and I also need headphones that can still function in my workout routine which can include runs in heavy rain.PROS:  Battery life, sound and noise-cancelling features.  The volume is almost too much, you wouldn't want to turn these things up more than half way.  Uses the same flat USB charging cord as many of my other devices.  The rubberish feel to these headphones gives the impression they will stand up to moisture although I have not tested that yet.CONS:  These have an integrated microphone.  People I talk to say there is an echo when I talk to them using these phone.  Also, the attachments that are meant to hold these in your ear are not terribly effective - they are somewhat flappy rubber extensions that don't really hold on to your ear snugly like some of the plastic devices I have seen on other headphones.I paid less than $40 for these so they are a good value.  I would rate higher if I was not using these for a workout routine.

Not as good as older version, cheap plastic.


Feels cheaper than previous versions of this product.I have had these headphones for years and the quality of the product for the price is great. I feel let down this time around, my old ones had the cord between the headphones crushed, my fault. This version is made of very light plastic, the outside sound echos more when you are wearing them, and the behind the ear part doesn't feel as natural to put on as before.  Might look elsewhere when these go bad.

An amazing set of earbuds.


Alright so I just recently returned a pair of ""truly wireless"" Bluetooth earbuds and based on the reviews I figured they'd be great. I was definitely wrong. They were horrible. So naturally I was hesitant to trust all the positive reviews I saw about these. But I decided to take a chance on them and I'm super glad I did. These earbuds are pretty much on par if not better than the power beats. And for the sale price, you're getting a whole more bang for your buck. The packaging was sleek and professional. The handbook wasn't written in Chinese and there were no grammar mistakes which if you use Amazon a lot to get bargain prices on products, you'll know that a Chinese hand book with sketchy English grammar isn't a good first sign or impression. You'll get a car charger with two different voltage usb connections and super cool 3ft charger cable that has the newer iPhone charge plug and the standard usb/Android charge plug. For those of you who have a Galaxy s8, you'll need an adapter for the Android end. You'll get a really sturdy carrying case that had a stylish foux carbon fiber skin, and inside you'll get several different eartips (including foam eartips which I thought was pretty cool) and the usb to charge your earset. The earbuds themselves are simplistic yet very stylish and comfortable. The only sort of annoying thing is that the hooks don't actually sit on your ear properly, or at least they don't for me. They sort of sit above my ears but with the eartips I'm not worried about them falling out. Also the hooks aren't some hard plastic like you'll get with most wireless sports earbuds. They're rubber and bend/contort to give you a very comfortable listening session. I haven't taken them to the gym yet and I will update once I know how well they sit in the ear and what other issues may arise. As for the sound, it's really really good for a pair of earsets this cheap. If you want a good starter set and don't wanna burn your wallet in the process, go for these. They're worth the hype and money.

Bought based on good reviews- Highly disappointed


I usually don't write reviews. I felt compelled in this case because of my disappointment in this product. I purchased these based on the reviews of other amazon users, and expected they would be at least ok to use at the gym, but they were frankly pretty terrible. I don't consider myself an 'audiophile', but I do appreciate good sound and these are not good. The headphones are utterly unable to produce any bass notes. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if they were just filtered out entirely, but instead they just distort terribly. The distortion then muddies up the rest of the music and make them almost unlistenable. And no, I was not listening to only bass heavy music nor was the turned all the way up. At only half volume, these headphones were distorting like crazy! the basic headphones that came with my phone sound much better. Without piling on too much, they also hurt my ears while wearing them. The only good thing i can say is they were fairly easy to pair and they don't seem to fall out of the ear. Maybe I got a ""bad batch"" but I will not be taking any more chances since Amazon charged me $6 to return them. I will be looking elsewhere, and I think you should too.

Immediately stopped pairing, hotline was unhelpful


Arrived and was able to pair with my phone, but then would not pair with my tablet.  I ""factory reset"" by directions and that worked to reset (was no longer paired with my phone), but then would not pair with anything.  Also, the power charger port rubber was cemented in place and my wife and I could not get it out without breaking the rubber.  I called the SENSO hotline for help and they told me I was incompetent and couldn't pair the headphones, so I just returned them for a different brand.

I'm a skeptical guy, and they work great


My first pair of bluetooth headphones... long story short, they perform as advertised, they're very affordable, and they're outstanding for use while exercising, or really any activity that causes you to sweat. These should suit most people (of course there's always going to be fussy exceptions out there!).Simple setup, does what I need, sound quality is decent, and they're reasonably comfortable for extended periods of time. The silicone surface has minimal slippage if you pick the right size (they give you three sizes), clean out any earwax, and twist it as you insert into your canals. The battery life is good so far.I needed an upgrade because I sweat a lot while running on the treadmill, and inevitably sweat will trickle down into my ear canal and block the apple earbuds I used to use for running. Problem solved. Also, these headphones do not wiggle and fall out as I bounce up and down -- a small but not insignificant inconvenience.As a skeptical buyer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to you -- they're cheap but surprisingly they work well.

Good Product for basic headphones


Good headphones for price range. I use this primarily for the gym and it has great range and sound. There are some breakups in sound esp when the phone is moving around. But for the most part it's all I need. I prefer to have ambient sounds coming through and this does the job. packaging is a plus with the 2 usb cords, case and earbud sizesUpdate 6/28/18: Moisture damage from workout. Tried to dry it out with silica packets overnight but short circuited (Smell of burnt electronics and plastic) when charged the next morning. Contacted seller, Tekatron for a replacement since it is only 3 months old.

Okay while they lasted


Sound quality, 3/5 - Doesn't overdo fake bass, doesn't rattle the ears. Obviously not for audiophiles but passable for someone who isn't picky with their audio. Gets plenty loud, needed to turn down to about 40-45% of my Android's max volume before it became too much.Battery: The battery life is short on these earbuds, I would say about 3-4 hours with the volume pretty high. Between work and the gym, I was charging them every day.The rubber cord holding the two buds together is rubberized and I would prefer them not to be. If the rubber rests on the bare skin of your neck and you aren't profusely sweating, the band will stick to your skin and one of the buds will come loose if you turn your head. Very annoying.I left these charging on a 1.2a car charger overnight and they melted, which also melted end of the charging cable. I used these for about a month and a half, probably about 30-35 1 hour+ listening sessions before this happened. If this was the fault of the cable or charger, the fuse would have likely popped in the cigarette lighter. Cannot recommend unless you can remember to yank the buds off the charger after an hour or so.

Not bad , but still uncertain


First time using them at the gym. (Received on 6/13/19). I got these because like many of other reviewers , my Powerbeats 3 stopped working only after only 8 months. I sweat a lot When I am at the gym so I needed something that would actually be sweatproof and not just claim to be. I must say I like these a lot so far. Pretty similar to the beats but ofc not identical. I did however experience some static interference at the gym ( the kind you encounter when you are too far from your phone and connected to the earphones ) even though my phone was right next to me. I’m hoping it was just a glitch and won’t happen again but we will see. So far for the price point I can’t complain.

Hard to get into ears but once I did, surprisingly great sound...


Let me start off with, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE for me to find ear buds I like. I want noise canceling and waterproof for the pool, cheap and all the things! Plus it's hard for me to find any that deliver all the things AND are comfortable. I was skeptical when these arrived because the wings that go around the ears are bigger than I expected and the cord, kind of long. I have abnormally small ear canals so it is really hard for me to find earbuds that stay (thus purchasing earbuds with wings). I fought to get them set just right so that they weren't falling out of my ears. Eventually, I tried the foam pieces they included and that seemed to help make a better seal. The pieces aren't easy to change but once you get them, they stay secured. When I got them in, I could still hear just about everything around me but it was muffled. No noise canceling. With that said, the second I put music on, the sound was incredibly impressive and I could no longer hear the world around me. The connection to my phone was easy peasy. Hold button 6 seconds, turn on blue tooth and select your device. BAM! Done. Overall, I am happy with these. They were crazy cheap, they're ""wireless"" (I've been mowing with wired earbuds and that is a true struggle with all the trees), and with music I can't hear the commotion in my office so I'm good. I have not tested moisture or waterproofing yet. I will update this review once I do. Oh! I tied back the cord and it isn't so bad. Probably a little longer than they need to be but not crazy.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY


Purchased a pair of these head phones last August.  The headphones completely stopped charging/ turning on after several months.  The company replaced the headphones which was great except the replacement pair ALSO stopped working.  I have literally owned two pairs of these headphones, both with light use and no excessive wear and tear and both times have failed under 6 months.  The company did not agree to replace the second pair which shows that they do not stand by their product.  It is safe to say this product is a piece of junk that will most likely fail after several months as I have experienced.  If you like the price, remember this is more of a rental price than a purchase because you WILL be buying a new pair.  I highly recommend shelling out a few more bucks for a more reputable product.  I'm skeptical of the highly regarded views on here.  Seems like a case of paid reviews to bump a product up the Amazon list...

left ear bud does not work - doesnt stay in ear well with sweat


Above average overall. Not bad sound, easy operation, and they provide me with sound whilst i pick things up and place them back down as well as box. Haven't tried running yet. As far as design, a pretty major flaw is that the power button is the senso logo on the right bud, so when i go to adjust it (because subsequently this is the bud that for some reason feels like its about to fall out which may because i have weird ears or a ergonomics thing) i turn the power off on accident, but its easy to turn it back on...Also after awhile of wearing these at work my ears started to hurt, but for working out purposes i wouldn't notice.

I purchased these in 2018, used them at them gym 4 days per weeks, washed them 5 times by mistake, lost them and didn't charge them for a month and they still performed flawlessly.

... only because I wasn't sure I would really get great sound at such a low price point


I was a little skeptical about purchasing these only because I wasn't sure I would really get great sound at such a low price point, but I was so wrong! I love these headphones. I love how soft the piece is that fits over your ear. I have had some that really can be bothersome. I do not consider myself an audiophile perfectionist, but I do know when sound is flat. You will not get flat sound with these. I really enjoyed listening to my music with these headphones and appreciate the sound quality. I use these in my office and the only thing I wish I could change is that the lowest volume setting could be reduced just a tad more. At the lowest volume setting when paired at the lowest volume setting with my iPhone, it is still a bit too loud for use in my office. When I try to turn my volume down more using the headset, it just mutes the audio, but does not turn it down any more. Regardless, I still am glad I purchased these and I am sure they will be perfect during a workout.

Glad I chose these!


It was a toss up as to whether I would replace my iPhone's cabled earbuds or whether I would venture into the world of cableless bluetooth. I'm glad that I did. The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones paired easily and quickly with my iPhone 7. I'd read that after market , non-Apple headphones and earbuds sometimes have trouble pairing with the iPhone. Not a hitch. I was quickly impressed with the sound of these little things. I'm much happier than I was with the original equipment that came with the iPhone.

Decent, but not great


I don't like the position of the main control button. When it is pushed it pushes the bud into the ear, cutting off all external sound. Why not have the button on the top so that you could squeeze against your thumb. Seems like a much more natural way to do it. Related to this is a couple of times the device got turned on while it was put in the the case -- so a fully charged device came out flashing red, pretty annoying. A top button could require more force to actuate, reducing unintended ""power on"" states.Also, the printed doc says it will audibly announce ""pairing"", but it does not. You hear ""power on"", and nothing else.

Once GREAT. Now just okay.


I used these headphones for 3 years and bought them for tons of friends and family as a gift. Durability, sound quality, customer service, all first rate. Note that I used one set for three years.However, recently they made the ear hooks ""adjustable,"" meaning they changed them from a stiff, springy rubber to a flexible rubber. Since the new earhooks do not retain a shape, they are ineffective at holding them onto your ear during vigorous activity like punching a heavy bag or turning your head quickly while wearing a jacket. Senso, can you please correct this product deficiency? When you do, I will change my review back to the 5 stars you deserve.

Great sound, great customer service.


The headphones fit well, sound great and they come with a carrying case and 3 sets of ear pieces to fit anyone.  When I first received them, I thought they were great, but experienced some loss of signal that I thought may have due to a defect. I contacted the company and received a reply right away. They explained how to do a factory reset in case there was a calibration problem and pointed out other possible causes for signal problems. It hadn't occurred to me that interference may occur so I checked the frequency that Bluetooth uses and discovered that it shares the band with many other devices. Such as wireless phones, garage door openers, satellite tv boxes, etc. The signal problems I was experiencing fit the pattern of such interference and the headphones sounded so good otherwise that I agree that interference was my problem.  That's something to remember regardless of which wireless device you are using.  Bottom line, great for the price and a company that stands behind their products.

These headphones are better!!!


So let me start by saying that I own Powerbeats 2 wireless Bluetooth headphones as well as jaybird X2 and the simple fact of the matter is these are better.  They fit well,they're comfortable, they have good sound awesome bass and power not to mention the added accessories and the price! I am generally a Bose snob so quality and clearity and power really matter to me. Shockingly enough these headphones sound close to my wired bose headphones and better than some of the top popular brands. Do yourself a favor and save some money and give these Bluetooth headphones a try. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Ps. I just ordered a 2nd pair to give away as a gift because I am that impressed!

Not One Size Fits All


Ordered this product after throughly reading the reviews. Returned due to very poor fit. Customer service claimed that the poor fit may be due ""anatomical uniqueness"". I found the elasticity of the ear hooks to be very oversized and offer zero aid in helping to hold the weight of the earbuds.This product is not one size fits all. Ear hooks are not adjustable and I found the headphones to be extremely uncomfortable.

Great set of inexpensive bluetooth earbuds for running.


Great inexpensive bluetooth earphones used for listening to music while running. No these are not ""high-end"" earbuds - but, in my opinion  they have all the necessary functions and provide a good balanced sound in both high and low frequencies.  I bought several sets of the MPOW Cheetah earbuds for my kids and they love them, but I personally found them to be too weak the the bass frequencies.  These Senso earbuds stay in place well while running, and come with a convenient carrying case, extra charge cables, ear pieces and a car adapter.  Overall for the price, a great deal.  Very happy with them so far.  Hope they keep working for a long long time!

Poor Sound Despite the Good Reviews


Poor  Sound is the main issue here. I bought these based on reviews here on amazon, and video reviews on youtube. The video reviews praised the sound and some  said they could not tell the difference between these and Beats. Well I can!They are plain vastly inferior. Yes they are loud, yes there is not much distortion...but there is no quality to the sound and I certainly would not waste my time listening to music with these. They sound like something from a bargain store.I am quickly coming to the conclusion that many are the reviews on here are still fake even though they claim to be verified purchases.I DO NOT recommend!

You can't beat these headphones for the price! I bought them to use when working out, and needed something that would pair with my Google XL 2 (no headphone jack on the phone). These worked out of the box, with no troubles. They pair easily with the workout machines so I can watch Netflix on them, listen to music, etc.They're comfortable (and I don't really like the ""ear bud"" style of headphones), and are very light weight. The ear clips fit comfortably. Comes with a neat carrying case with enough storage for the charging cord and extra ear inserts.I'd definitely buy these again!

Good luck getting them to fit and I hope you don't mind limited bass.


Bought as a birthday present for my daughter. As far as sound goes, they were not nearly as good as the ad on Amazon described. But the biggest problem is that they would not stay on her head under any circumstances. We messed with all the different size ear buds and tried everything we could think of for two hours before we just gave up. They would fall off at the slightest movement or even the blink of an eye or even if she was as still as she could be. They sort of fit me okay but I couldn't get the ear buds in far enough to get a decent sound. They obviously were not made to fit a 12 year old child and as an adult, I had my problems with them too. I had to return them to Amazon and I am just waiting for my refund. I called the service number on the card that came with the ear buds and the rep told me I had to buy a more expensive model to get one that would work for my daughter. Nah, don't think so.

Satisfied - would buy them again.


I left another review - but got an email from the company. First - shipping was outrageously fast!!!!! Love the product packaging. Next, I didn't realize how much was included - WOW - love the case for the earbuds and the supplied car charger and cords. Lastly, the earbuds. The instructions are earsy to follow. Having wireless earbuds already, I felt the setup was intuitive. They are comfortable and the sound is great. Will be cruising later this year and wanted another set of earbuds - so I'll always be ready - so to see these as being waterproof was a plus. So far, I'm very satisfied and would recommend them. If you are a person that is looking for BOSE quality however, these are not for you! For exercising and cruising - these serve my purpose.

Great Headphones for working out


These headphones came with great value. You do get a dual car charger, a dual micro/lightning USB cable (Its one cable with 2 choices of input), different size earbuds, and a convenient case for the headphones itself. The sound on them is great, not the greatest I've heard but does the job and does it well with decent clarity through bluetooth. The headphones themselves are comfy and pretty much tangle-free. The charge on them is awesome as well since I use them for the gym (holds about 7-8 hours charge). If you need to take a call these do the job as well.Honestly this was the best purchase of a decent affordable bluetooth headset I've ever used. Definitely worth the price and usage.

Best I have tried


These are by far the best head phones I have used!!  I have tried a couple different wireless and don't like the one where the receiver hangs on the cord.  The volume on these are great.  I have some hearing loss and many of the head phones I tried were ok listening in a quiet area, but I had difficultly hearing the music on my mountain bike rides and in the gym.  I can use these for either of those activities and can hear the music nicely.The sound quality is very good.  They are also very comfortable in the ear and do not fall out.Before buying these, I bought a pair of Plantronics backbeat fit for $129.  They did not fit in the ear nicely and the volume was pretty week.  I returned those and bought these.  I can say that the sound quality is just as good as the $129 ones!!  You cannot beat these head phones for this price.

Listen to me, purchase these now!


Most satisfied I have ever been with a product ever! Let me start from the beginning.  Im a crossfitter and recently decided to put a little bit more running into my fitness lifestyle.  So I plan my 18 week running program to supplement crossfit and head out the door to purchase my running ""must haves.""  I only like to run in running shorts that have the built in briefs, thats another story in itself, but lets just say I'm pretty happy (with the fit/ not so much price) so far with the 4 pair of UA running shorts I just purchased.  Next I head over to Target to look for a pair of bluetooth headphones.  Many pairs upwards of $80 to $200, I elected to go with the $57? wireless around the ear ""whatever"" brand.  Fast forward to a test run on a treadmill and I'm totally POed.  I want the music cranked when I'm working out and all I could hear was the treatmill, with a little whisper of music in the background.  I found myself continually trying to max out the volume which was already pegged out.  Not to mention that the ear piece was extremely uncomfortable.  Fast forward again to Amazon Prime's best seller and this purchase which came in in a quick 2 days.  Never had something more comfortable on and around my ear, sound will make you go deaf, the wire is short enough so its not bouncing around on your neck when running, and the accessories and carry thing well constructed.  So purchases these now, and hit me up for any questions.  Mr. B O B

Awesome Sound


I was looking for some headphones because I am a big fan of bass. I liked these headphones because they produce very good bass. Sound quality is fair, and noice cancellation is good as well. I didn't face any challenge connecting to bluetooth with Andriod, and iOS devices. The setup is very easy. The only negative about these headphones was that they stopped working after 3 months, but I got a replacement for free so that was good.

Good for the price, but


You get what you pay for. The sound is adequate, coming from Bose earbuds they're a very noticeable step down but not terrible. The pairing works quickly and I never had any trouble with them disconnecting.My biggest gripe with them is the weight and fit. More specifically one bud is heavier than the other since it houses the controls and the battery. For me the result is that the heavier bud never stays in my ear while at the gym. Even the slightest tilt of my head and it falls out. I tried all the different tip sizes and still it falls out. Readjusting it constantly made it even worse than my wired headphones getting caught so I just switched back.They were only 30 bucks so I can't really be that mad and they do work fine if I'm sitting at my desk but I bought them for the gym and since they fail there they fail entirely for me.

Fully recommended.


This headphones impressed me. I like the sound and how they look. Love the fact that they came with so many accessories, and they were easy to set up. Main thing I like is that they stay in place without hurting my ear. I tried so many kinds and nothing would stay in while I was running etc. except for some really painful others. These I had them on for like 2 hours straight and I didnt feel any discomfort. I would recommend them, probably top choice for the price they cost.There is a little downside it is the mic. I dont know why but the other person almost couldnt hear me and when I tried to record a voice message it was very unclear. Maybe it's because of the position of the mic... or maybe not... anyway they do the job.

Get’s the job done


I’m now on my third pair. - I use these all day long, from my long daily bike rides to my long walks to around the house when I don’t want to disturb my housemate.  They hold up to abuse — sweat, rain, whatever. And the controls are intuitive. I see people with expensive earbuds and such and I just don’t get it.  I find the wire is an advantage - it’s not in the way and it allows me to keep them together to prevent loss and to pull them off and keep them around my neck without fear of loss.  Still don’t get why people pay a fortune for those other silly things.

Use the box not the case for storage.


Great for workouts and sound was clear. The case is too narrow to fit them easily. So after so many times of trying to squeeze them perfectly up in the case, the part that goes in the ear broke. I glued it back with Gorilla glue, but it broke again. And of course it was after a year warranty plus not sure if it would have qualified. I liked them so much I brought 2 pair after I misplaced and then later found the first pair. The person I sold the 2nd pair to loved them as well. Bummer. So buy them but keep in the box not the case.

Subpar copy of letsfit


I owned two pairs of the letsfit version. Of these and the were fine for the price. Well those are broke.and so I bought these. These sensors feel cheap to the touch. The audio quality is noticeable worse than the letsfit and the boot up sample sounds blown out. I returned these, because their a  cheap ripoff of an already budget headphone

Good quality headphones at a great price


The sound on these is good. They stay seated in my ear pretty well even during vigorous exercise. I occasionally have to drill one side back in, but it's pretty rare.One design flaw is that the pause/off button is on the outside of the right earpiece, so if you try to push that earpiece into your ear, you end up pausing the music... Also I could do without the slowly blinking blue light during normal operation--it's pretty distracting in a dark airplane cabin, especially to fellow passengers.Battery life is fantastic. They are comfortable for long use. Overall I'm very happy with them.

Best one around for the price


You really can’t get much better for this price. I’m an audiophile but these are just my workout headphones.The headphone stay in no problem. They have a slightly boosted low end which could make it sound a bit muffled but most people wouldn’t noticed.Phone calls do work seamlessly by the quality is muffled and it doesn’t sound the best.DOES last 8-10 hours.Other wireless headphones I’ve tried:I tried the Powerbeats 3. Trash. JBL reflect mini beats are also good and those are my other pair I go to. Much cleaner sound and better with phone calls.

These have been fantastic for over a couple of months now


These have been fantastic for over a couple of months now. I have only had them die on me once, and they have been able to hold charge for at least 5 days at the gym @ 2hrs a day. I have also taken them snowboarding and survived an 8 hour day. They have been exposed to hot, cold, sweat, rain, and still keep on kicking.The only thing I do not like is that bluetooth can be a little spotty to connect to if you are using multiple devices. They have been difficult to use between my phone and computer in the sense of getting them to pair correctly.

Great headphones with 1 big annoyance


Shipping was fast, came with 4 pairs of ear plugs (3 silicon, 1 foam), a short charging cable and a long one with a lightning adapter, and a car charger, plus a case.They took a while to get used to, they weren't as comfortable in my ears as my old wired earbuds. Sound quality and battery life are great as well.So why not 5 stars? They came with 2 pieces you can put on the wire to keep it from dangling on your neck, and my cord wants to twist no matter what I do and it's so damn annoying. I tried hanging them to let the cord straighten out, but it's still twisting, and that annoyance stops these from getting 5 stars.

Love the headhones


Love the headhones.  They work all over my 2 story house with the phone plugged into a charger on my desk.  Came with extras such as magnetic holder for phone to car vent, cell phone credit card holder, wire clip and carrying case.  They are a little buggy when connecting to iphone 6 Bluetooth  but it is probably the phone as much as the headphones.  You get a little voice prompt when turning on and off and when connecting to Bluetooth which is nice.  They seem to keep extraneous noise out while wearing.  They should be a great help when mowing season begins - not being connected with a wire doing yard work.

Beautiful headphones, easily set up


Beautiful headphones, easily set up. They arrived immediately. I'm delighted! The sound is just beautiful, and they stay in my ears effortlessly when I run. I can't say that about many earphones. I was looking online for a company video showing set up, but short of finding that, only reviews, I relied on the instructions. Extremely small print makes it hard to read (for all us baby boomers!), but the directions aren't complicated. The rubberized features and the angle of the earbud that fits into my ear are exactly right. Initially a friend showed me his, and so I looked for Senso on Amazon. The price, as you can see, was what sold me right away. It's the quality that hooked me.

For the price, these are great headphones. The battery seems to last me 12 hours or so of constant play time (I work overnights and listen to music while working). I am able to work my 9 hours and then go to the gym right after and have plenty of juice left.Pros:PriceAuto-connects to my phone when turned onBattery lifeStays in ears 9/10 times without issue while working and working out.Cons:When running and the cable bounces on the back of my neck, I get some weird fuzzy sound sometimesPart that goes around my ear doesn't really do anything, it sticks up pretty high above my earsSize, they seem a little bulky, but you don't really notice unless you look in the mirror and see them.Overall, I would buy again without hesitation due to the price, sound, and battery life. They definitely get their use.

but the other earbuds provided (rubber) have held up well so far and are comfortable for extended periods of time


I've had these for a month and a half now. The headphones were a little uncomfortable at first but I quickly adjusted to them as I did not use the around the ear style previously. The foam earbuds wore out rather quickly and showed serious wear and tear within 2 weeks, but the other earbuds provided (rubber) have held up well so far and are comfortable for extended periods of time. The volume on these is excellent and I have not had to max the volume between the buds and phone once, even in the car with the windows down on the freeway. Excellent purchase for the price. Will update in the future after further use.Edit: These died after 5 months. Simply would not pair to any device even when fully charged and a factory reset used. Looking at the other reviews, it appears this is a common problem. I've attempted to contact the seller by phone but haven't had any luck so far. Will update if I hear back, but I have to reduce my score. There's no reason these should have stopped working and I made sure to never immerse them in water (sweat is as bad as it got) and never used a fast charger.Second Edit: The seller has contacted me via email and agreed to replace the product with minimal frustration or issue. I should have the new paid by Friday. I've adjusted back to 4 stars due to the company quickly and professionally honoring the warranty.

So far, so good (update: still going strong)


So far so good. Only had it for a couple days, but initial impressions are the product is really high quality, even more so given the price. Product comes with great case, and multiple charging plugs as well as multiple sizes for ear buds. Have used it a couple times, and it paired quickly and sound while running was great. Definitely has a decent noise-canceling capability. Very happy so far!

Great!


I bought these for myself back in August because I really wanted a pair of Bluetooth headphones but refused to pay Beats prices. They are fantastic! Way better than I expected for the price. The sound quality is great and they are comfortable in my ears for long periods of time. I was surprised to learn that I could also answer calls on them. The sound was great and they could hear me well. My only complaint is this: the time from the first low battery audio warning until they turn off is like 5 minutes. I feel like there should be more of a warming. Still, these are fantastic and I highly recommend them.

great buy!


Love this thing.  For the price and the strong sweatproof performance, I give this 5 stars.  It lasts roughly 4-5 hours of usage though.  So I'm recharging after every 3rd time I use it so it doesn't die while I'm on my 1 hour commute on the 4th usage.I've had no reception issues even in the subway.  The jaybird I had previously would stop working once i was underground even with the phone was right next to it.  I can walk away 20 - 30 feet in the gym and still be connected to this thing.I do have to say that the i phone and this thing sometimes have trouble connecting on the first go with Spotify. But nothing a few restarts of the bluetooh and headphones can't fix.

Quality is great...cord is too short or too long, it hits the back of my neck or my throat when I wear a shirt with no collar and I think it's a bug, I don't like bugs...you have to turn the volume way down to get the noise reduction to work if you are walking and talking outside and there is any wind at all, I understand that is normal for any unit with noise reduction, maybe not with a more expensive one???..Excellent battery system, quick charge and last many hours for me, I use it a lot...I wouldn't buy this exact one again...Wide selection of ear plugs, I got a good fit!

These headphones are a good deal for the money. They pair easily, the sound quality is good and they hold a charge for a really long time. I didn't think I'd like the noise cancellation initially as I use them for running outside and it doesn't seem super safe to not be able to hear what's going on in your surroundings, but that isn't the case. I am still able to hear enough to feel safe but it blocks some of the sound that would make it hard to hear my music. Overall a win in my book.

Wasn't expecting much and was still disappointed.


I often rely on customer reviews before I buy something; seeing that these earbuds had great reviews, I decided to try them. I wasn't really expecting much, just for them to work and have decent sound quality. I was very disappointed; the sound quality is not as the product described. The earbuds don't really have that deep bass that it advertises, it more just muffles the rest of the music. Vocals sound very muffled and the highs and lows aren't really there. Ordered these with one day shipping and I returned them as soon as I got them. You can find higher quality earbuds at BestBuy for the same price or lower (I have better earbuds that I got for $25). An obvious red flag that I ignored was all of the additional items that came with the earbuds; if a product's not great then manufacturers throw in extra stuff to compensate.PROS:- They work- Small and lightweight- Power on and connect quicklyCONS:- Bad, muffled sound quality- Feel very cheap and flimsy- You can find better quality earbuds than this for the same price

I would definitely recommend this product and I would buy them again. I’ve had them for a few months and I am impressed with how long the charge stays on. I also enjoy the feature that if you don’t have any sound coming through the headphones they will automatically turn off to reserve your battery after a period of time.  I was mainly looking for headphones that I could use when I do water  aerobics , light swimming, or just walking the pool they have gotten wet and they have held up just fine.

Affordable Bluetooth Headphones


The price for these headphones is within a reasonable range for anyone wanting to try out Bluetooth headphones for the first time. These are my first and I was happy with the purchase after I tried them out for a week or two. They have great range, are very comfortable, and the audio is quite good. The battery life on these are as described and last a long time before needing to be charged. The only setback I've had with them is the fact they don't block out too much sound for me from my surroundings and they malfunctioned a little at the beginning for how far I could go from my phone. The distance disparity was gone after the third time I tried it out and have been quite happy with them since. Also a side note, the accessories that came with it are really fantastic.

Great Headphones-Good Value


Excellent product.  Use mainly for outdoor work and this product fits my needs perfectly.  Easy to use, fit is fine, holds a charge for 6-7 hours maybe longer (I always put them back on the charger when I'm done using them).  Accepting incoming calls is very easy with this device and the caller can hear me perfectly-device announces the phone number for the incoming call so I can determine if I want to accept the call prior to answering.I did have a problem with the charging mechanism on the first pair, but I contacted the company and a replacement pair was shipped out immediately with no problem at all-I had the replacement within 3-4 days.

Good for short term use


I had a GREAT headset off of Amazon over a year ago but they stopped charging. I will say I'm a  mega sweater and my last ones lasted longer than any Sony headphones, but they no longer were made and this was the closest option. The battery doesn't last too long, if I put my phone in my pant pockets it will disconnect as if its too far. Once its at 15% or 10% it gives a warning like every 30 seconds which is annoying. They do the job for short term workouts and work days

I am not necessarily an audiophile but I really enjoy music and appreciate what these headphones have to offer


At first I a bit cautious of these headphones. I am not necessarily an audiophile but I really enjoy music and appreciate what these headphones have to offer. I personally lean toward my music have more bass so they work well for me. They do tend to be on the heavy side when it comes to certain songs and it almost starts to over power the highs but you cant expect the world from headphones at this price range. If you want a perfect balance of mids, highs, and lows that have studio quality sound I would not recommend these but instead a professional set of headphones that cost 300+. But if you want good headphones that have good sound quality that you enjoy to listen to and work well for working out I cant recommend them enough.Pros:-Comfortable-Water resistance-Easy to use-Good sound Quality overall-Comes with a lot of accessories-Amazing price pointCons-Can be overwhelming on the bass at times for some listeners-No indication on battery percentage

Great sound great head phones but I use an Apple ...


Great sound great head phones but I use an Apple Watch 3 to run so I don’t have to take my phone. I know Bluetooth works through air not body so if you wear your watch on your right hand you’re golden, if you wear it on your left, it cuts out once your hand goes behind your back. Needs a little strong Bluetooth connection. If you use a phone just keep it open connection to your right ear. Took me a little bit to figure that out. Didn’t work for me so I returned. Good customer service, good price just didn’t work for me.

Wow, totally surprised by what you get for the money.  As an avid Amazon consumer and one that has been duped by knockoff's on various purchases these are the real deal.  They sound great and they last all of the 8 hours as advertised.  I tried the ""flexible"" rubber earpiece but ended up choosing the memory foam earpiece for all day comfort.  The charging port cover is a little tricky to get off (would recommend and ""larger"" nubins for future runs of these headphones).  I am hoping they hold up.

Spend money elsewhere


I'm a distance runner so I rely on music to keep me occupied.  The first thing I noticed was the sound was not so clear. It was slightly muffled.  The first time I used it I was out for 2 hours and the battery was fine. The second use after charging they died after 10 mins of being turned on. The 3rd try, I noticed the battery wouldn't fully charge (only reached 70% after plugged in overnight) and they died again after only 10 mins.I contacted the company and they told me to reset the earbuds, so I did but to no avail, I contacted the company a second time and no response, so I returned the defective item.

Reliable pair of headphones for runners


These headphones are really great. I'm a runner and these are my first wireless headphones. I've been using these for about a month now and they're perfect for workouts! I haven't had Bluetooth connection problems and the headphones last a day of use after a full charge.In terms of wear, you need to be wearing both ear pieces when you're using them (unless you find a clever a way to fasten the other earpiece.) I'm not quite 100% satisfied with the fit of the ear pieces as well. The wing that goes behind the ears are a little big (and my ears are not on the smaller side.)The headphones are a little old school and the notice sounds for calls is an old chime followed by a female voice calling out the phone number.Overall, the headphones are worth the price! They do the job.

They turn on and call people by themselves


I love my headphones and would have used them forever. Unfortunately, they keep turning on by themselves. I always keep them in the case, so I thought maybe the on button was being pushed inadvertently. I rearranged them to make sure nothing could push it, but it was still happening. Then I tried to leave the side with the on button out of the case, but it was still happening.When they turn on the least that happens is that I can't use my phone because the volume is coming through the headphones and I don't know that it is turned on. The worst that happens is that it makes phone calls. I didn't know it was doing that and it ended up calling one number 8 times in a row. The other person couldn't tell me because when they called back, it went to the headphones that were in another room so I didn't know it was ringing. This has been happening off and on for a couple of months now.If they fixed this issue, these would be a great product and I would highly recommend them!Update: I reset them as suggested, and they seem to be working fine now. I would recommend them and would probably buy them again in the future.

Good battery life, okay sound


There are alot of reasons to like these, and several not to. They have surprising range, reaching several rooms over from my phone with no loss. Good battery life, about 8hrs of continuous use. I use the memory foam ear pieces, which mold to the inside of my ear and are fairly comfortable. While each side of these headphones is large, the wire between them is thin and doesn't get in the way. Good price too. However, sound quality is only okay, with poor bass response and lack of clear highs. The controls can be difficult to find and use without knocking the ear piece off your ear, and the over-ear clip is nonadjustable, and doesn't fit my ears very well. These are decent for cheap Bluetooth headphones, but you can get alot better by spending a bit more.

Update: these do not work outside be warned!


Updated review: I purchased these to run outside freely and had been using them indoors and they were working great indoors. I finally had the opportunity to test them outside during a run, they were awful they kept cutting in and out and I couldn't listen to anything! The phone was on my arm in a sleeve right near the headphones so distance wasn't the issue. I was very frustrated by them I ran back and got my tangle me up headphones to finish my run! I'm very disappointed.Previous review: I purchased these to run and workout freely while listening to music. So far so good with the headphones. If anything changes I'll be sure to update my review. They fit my ears fine and stay in place with all the sweat and movement. And the sound quality is great, it masks most sounds well.

Something has change... and not for the better


I have previously purchased a pair of these headphones, and was very happy.  Unfortunately, I ended up losing them, and so decided to repurchase them.  Something has changed.  The ear-hooks are now so weak, they don't effective work as a ""hook"".  They too easily just bend out of shape.  I used to have no problem running with my old pair... but with this new pair, I can't even keep them in my ears while working out on a bench.  Additionally, with this new pair, I have to charge them much more frequently.  Right now, I have to charge them about every other day.

Best workout headset I've ever had


These are the best workout earbuds I've ever had.  Tried numerous wired and wireless options over the last decade or so, but these rock!  The over ear design keeps them secure through long runs, or circuit training.  The behind the neck cord stays out of the way.  Battery life must be great, because I can only remember one time that I got a low battery warning in over a year of regular use.  I mostly listen to audio books and the voice quality is great, and is pretty great for music as well.  Highly recommend these

Worked well for a while. Now they will not stay connected.


Works well.  Only one small issue, sometimes while using them they will randomly disconnect from my phone and I have to power them off wait a few seconds and turn them back one.  It's only happened a few times out of the dozens of times I have used them.Update Aug 3, 2018The connectivity issues I was having have worsened, It happened again while I was out and I thought that it might have been due to a low battery so I charged them overnight, and then after about 15 minutes of use they disconnected again.  I turned the headphones off and on, turned the Bluetooth on my phone on and off but could not get them to connect.

You get what you pay for


I will be ordering a new pair of headphones from a different company. I'll do a better job shopping around. This is my third pair of headphones that has stopped working.These headphones lasted from mid-May 2018 until today, and were sent to me as a replacement for another pair of headphones that stopped working completely in early May (I had those for well under a year). Specifically, with this pair what happened to me today is that the left earbud completely stopped working while the right earbud is still working.When it works, it works well. The audio sounds good and they really are noise cancelling. But after some time/use, a couple of common problems that I had with all three pairs that I owned is 1) When you're trying to talk on the phone, you have to hold out the bud with the built in microphone because otherwise, the person that I'm talking to can't hear me well. 2) If I walk 10 feet away from the device that I'm using, the audio breaks up and disconnects. This started to happen to me over the last couple of weeks with this pair, and today, the left earbud just stopped working. I would suggest to pay a little extra and get better quality headphones. I am giving a star back because their customer service is great and they get back to you very quickly.

Bluetooth connection is garbage. Constantly going in and out and skipping around. Sounds like Discman skipping.


Very disappointing. The fit for running is great. I like the physical body of these earphones, but what's the point of the bluetooth connection is non functional? Really frustrating that every 20 seconds you get skipping garbled sounds. Makes them unusable. Invotek does not offer exchanges so have to return it. Wait at least a week from them receiving to get my money back and re-order again somewhere else. Not worth it. Find another supplier or try different headphones.

Good overall design and experience, but still room for improvement


I've had these headphones for a few weeks now and use them with an iPhone 6. I use them for running, walking, and wearing around the house doing chores to listen to music or audio books. No issues with rubbing or falling out while running. Overall they're a good design and I'd buy them again, although I do have a few complaints. One the lowest setting on the volume is still louder than I'd prefer when I'm resting and there's no background noise. Two, the mid-range and high end range of sound is a little murky, I'm not too picky on sound quality, but if you're an audiophile this will bother you.

Sensational SENSOS!


Amazing wireless headphones!  The sound is great with comfort, too!  They paired right up with my iPhone per instructions with minimal effort.  Although I initially had some difficulty with my iPhone not turning off the headphones when disconnected for the SENSOS, I learned that a longer press on the SENSO button did the trick. The voice alert to charge the SENSOS was very helpful. Also, a voice alert informs when you are connected and ready to go.  I think the SENSOS provide an excellent choice for wireless listening with a cost that is a fraction of others out on the market.  I highly recommend these!

Pretty cool!


I was amazed at how well they were packaged in how much came with the headphones themselves I'm quite pleased especially with the charging cord they could charge both I phones and android phones. It appears they went out of their way to make people happy with this product. I normally feel like breaking the headphones in with sound quality like using a white-noise for an hour but these were not necessary for that. That means the sound was perfect from the word go. The only downside I saw was the lack of flexibility with the piece that goes over your ear other than that they're perfect.

Great sound for a great price


These are amazing headphones. I use them when I work out on a rowing machine and all I hear is crisp, vibrant music. They produce the best sound I've ever heard through earphones and they block out the noise in the background almost completely. They're lightweight and comfortable and were simple to pair up with my phone. When I bought these from Amazon, they were right at $35 dollars which is considerably below their list price and the price of other similar big name headphones. I've tried the big name headphones just like these and couldn't tell any difference. These appear to be of a similar quality, so if they hold up, I think I will have made an excellent purchase.

Quality headphone during running with a reasonable price


I just bought two.Considering its price, the product is pretty good.1. Due to two hooks on your ears, it won't fall during running.2. All parts are soft which makes it comfortable to wear.3. Only three buttons, but all common functionalities are available.4. I used Edifier W670BT. This one is far better than that in sound quality.5. Its battery can last longer than W670BT as well.The only two minor cons for me is:1. The built-in mic is at one earphone and the reception isn't very good.2. The earplugs are translucent for the red one, but not for the blue one. For me, I really like the translucent earplugs.In summary, I think this is a quality headphone during running with a reasonable price.I'll recommend it to my friends if they need.

Odd looking, but they really do fit well and are not a bother to wear for long periods of time. The sound is fine and the battery recharges well.  I do wish something were different about the connecting wire, maybe stiffer?? don't know, but I am just an old fussbudget.As a accessory, they are great, work well and come with 2 storage options - a cardboard sliding drawer for by the table, AND a really NICE zippered carrying case for out and about.  Yes, I would get them again, and probably will if and when the battery dies.  Colors would be a good new option.

Perfect Knock Off Beats


First time I wore these someone asked me if they were knockoff beats, at first I wanted to say no, but then I realized they actually were a perfect knock off. Generally the term knock off has a negative connotation, but here I think it is high praise. SENSO was able to sell a pair of headphones a fraction of the price of a big name brand that does the exact same thing. I normally lift weights during my workouts and these things stay out of my way, offer great sound quality and last for at least a weeks worth of workouts (5 days @ ~1 hour each). My ONLY comment is that at higher volumes the bass distorts pretty bad, but the sound canceling/isolation is so good that i don't have to crank my music to hear and enjoy it. On top of that that ""distorted"" sound is what beat's owners seem to love, so I bet they were just trying to copy it. Overall, definitely worth the ~$30 I paid for them and I will be purchasing another pair should these ever stop working.

Good, but could be better.


Very good overall. The sound quality is as expected for this price range: A bit washed out but definitely decent. Do not purchase these if you think you are going to get a great audio experience, but rather if you want something that's really good for around $30-$40.The reason why I have to rate it a 3 star and not higher is that the left earbud makes a static noise when you start playing music. It's audible until you  turn the volume up higher but if you do not like to listen to loud music then you constantly hear a sort of buzz. I do not know if it just mine, but that issue has been present since I purchased it. It did not really get worse, but it did not get better either.I would recommend these if you want a good, bluetooth earbud set for an affordable price.

Excellent Headset for the Price


I needed a set of bluetooth headphones for work, got tired of being tangled up in a wired model. These hold a good 8+ hours every day, sound pretty decent for streaming audio and have an amazing range, a couple hundred feet easily before the signal drops. It usually reconnects once back in range, but occasionally I have to ""force"" connect it back at the computer. Good fit and have several tips for different earhole sizes, nice carrying case also. Just get used to charging every night, you can't use them while charging even with a long enough cable.Update: After almost a year of use, the battery life of 8 hours held strong, but the physical connection on the left earpiece from the cord  became loose causing a horrible crackling, intermittent connection. Customer service was fantastic, had me try a few things and when the problem persisted, they sent out a brand new set (with all the accessories!) right away. The 2nd pair is a little ""stiffer"" and oddly don't fit as well as the originals but sounds just as great.

I've been able to use this product maybe 10 times now and much of it is fantastic, however they messed up one of the basic (simplest, inexpensive) features, the rubber chord that connects the two ear pieces, it's too short.  The rubber chord being so short rubs against the nape of your neck which is in part irritating but more so because it tends to ""grab"" your neck it will tug the ear pieces out of your ears at times when you turn your head.  As said, the technology part seems to be great but what good is it if the rubber strap being too short negates everything.  Recommendation to the manufacturer, add 4""-6"" to the rubber chord and you'll have a great product.

Lasted a few months


These earphones lasted about three months.  Now they are just dead.  The battery won't recharge at all.  The sound quality was always pretty 'meh' from the beginning, but the most irritating thing about these earbuds was that they couldn't hold a connection with the sound source without cutting in and out CONSTANTLY.  That was a problem from the beginning, so while I love the convenience of bluetooth and hands free, the quality is not very good.  If these were $10 headset, I wouldn't even complain, but at almost $30, I expect a bit more.

Great headphones for the money


This is my second pair I have purchased of the same earbuds. I want to clarify something, I am not a crazy, gotta be a perfect pitch kind of guy, please understand that. My first purchase of these buds was in April of 2017 and I paid about 35 bucks. They lasted almost 2 1/2 years of constant use as well as abuse and whether I was at the gym with volume maxed out ( and they handled that) or relaxing watching a movie these buds did the job for me. My recently purchased 2nd pair work as well as the first set and only cost 20 bucks. If you are looking for a very inexpensive set of buds that deliver great sound, then these should work for you. Looking for say Bose quality, then no, but I am pretty hard on my buds and these hung in there with me for over 2 years originally. I went back to them and am not disappointed. I still haven't received my free gift as promised, so I wouldn't count on getting it if I were you

Good for their price. The connectivity is good. One down side is that their min. volume is still pretty loud for a quiet office setting, and the max volume will cause you to go deaf in an hour. No need for the crazy amount of volume. Sound quality is 5/10 also... Looks like they went for loudness not clarity. Actually.. its kinda garbage now that I think about it.

Can't live with the audio trade-offs


Tried these out for all of 10 minutes before deciding they weren't for me. As others have said, the bass is HEAVY by default and there is no mode adjustment. The problem is that the bass causes distortion and everything sounds horrible. Since my iPhone has no way of storing different EQ settings for different devices, its not worth keeping these to have to manually change the settings each time I switch devices. And even with the EQ set to bass-reducer, they still don't sound that good.I will say they seemed pretty comfortable and the additional accessories are a nice bonus though.

These wireless headphones are IMO are just as good as the higher priced ones. I struggle with the EarPods that just stick in your ear. They are always falling out and the ones with a cord are worse because I'm alway yanking them out of my ear every time I turn my head. With these the hook keeps them from pulling out and the soft ear pads are very comfortable for extended listening. Coupled with the fact that they are wireless, you don't have to worry about them being yanked out when you turn your head or get too far from you phone.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

The faulty element in the design remains. The rubber port cover for charging doesn’t seal properly and isn’t durable.Considering they lasted this long, not bad for the price.

Good Set for the Money but needs improvement


I bought this set to have something to use when cutting grass and plane trips. Has good sound but does sound muffled at times.  This set tends to disconnect and reconnect from Bluetooth which can be frustrating but turning the headset off and back on again after the initial connection more often than not fixes the issue for the rest of the listening session.  Not sure why it can't stay connected the first time.  I have experienced this issue on several devices and many different environments.

You have a good product, just not me


You have a good product, just not me. I like the sound, functionality, and quality of them, but the ear loops are just too flexible for my ears and consequently they keep falling off my ears when I walk. I tried the three different ear buds, but to no avail. I need to find buds with stiffer hoops and/or has a wire embedded in them to shape around the ear tightly, but this may not be possible. For the reasons I stated above I will be returning the ear buds.Not to worry about a negative review, I won't be giving one. The problem is just as much as my ears, as it is your ear buds.Thanks for your concern.LV & David Schisler

Increased cost and reduced quality!


I am extremely disappointed with my second pair of these headphones. I loved the first pair, but left them behind on a plane so I oreder another. I bought my first pair at a cheaper price ($20) and they had better quality. Here's what's wrong with my most recent order:1) The ear hooks are no longer adjustable, but have been replaced by a stiffer rubber which gives off a strong chemical odor.2) The foam, ear plug-like end pieces are now thinner and not as comfortable as the original ones3) The included accessories are different and NOT as pictured here. Instead of including a white charging cable and car adapter, this new set came with a phone case card holder and magnetic phone mount. If you get a set with these new items, I suggest returning your headphones because these come with the cheaper new model.

Decent buds at the price point, but sound quality is somewhat disappointing.


On the Pro side, these buds are very comfortable and appear to be well constructed.  The carrying case and accessories are a very nice plus.  The package as a whole is offered at a very attractive price point.On the Cons side, when the same music is listened to on more conventional headphones, distortion of highs on these buds are definitely evident (i.e., cannot be attributed to the recording).  Bass is on the weak side, and the ""noise cancelling"" is so-so. You will not get a high level of clarity on these phones except in the mid-ranges.  I wouldn't call the sound quality ""terrible"" but it is lackluster and somewhat disappointing.

So I got me a new one and I was supposed to send the broken one back, well when I got the new one IT WAS ALSO BROKEN. Just broke after a few weeks of use and I didnt even put water on it. This is the worse headphones I have ever bought. STAY AWAY. I was working a lot at the time and I didn't have time to return them so I was charged for 2 broken headphones.

reasonable sound, some hook-up issues


some difficulty getting them paired -- had to do the off/on/reboot multiple times to get them to hook up to either ipod or iphone. When they did, music sounded good although occasionally a ""hitch"" in the music -- I think a bluetooth connection issue.  Comes with multiple eartips which is good, I had to downsize from the standard to get a reasonable fit. The extra accessories were a nice touch and made the package price-worthy.  The mention of 'passive noise cancellation' is just advert bunk -- this has no function of that sort.

Good Sound, Easy to Use, but a few Cons


The sound quality of the headphones is good (I'd say 4 stars) and I find them easy to use, but I have given the headphones a lower rating for the following reasons:- The pieces that go over your ears are floppy and can't be adjusted to fit to your ears, and in my case, they sit above my ear so they don't provide any benefit.  In fact, they  bumped against my glasses and caused the headphones to come out of my ears. I ended up cutting off the over ear pieces.- There is a warning that comes on when the headphones need to be charged.  That's a great idea, but it gives you very little warning (maybe 5 more minutes of use), which in my opinion makes the warning kind of useless. It would have been better if a warning was provided when there is at least 30 minutes to an hour more of use.

Broke College Student Friendly Headphones :)


UPDATE: They have finally reached their limit. After about a year and a half they have broken, they will not stay connected to my phone or even stay on. I guess you get what you pay for with these.I used to bye $10 earbuds from amazon but I kept losing my iPhone dongle (which is also $10) so I decide to get wireless headphones. I also needed something better for an active life (not always worrying about a wire when working out).I've had these headphones for about a year and I've used them at the gym, on the plane, in my room, etc. The sound quality isn't anything terrible, I don't find my music to be dull or empty but not 100% like Bose headphone quality (expected). I'm able to run/lift/bike and have no problems with them staying in. Sometimes when I leave my phone to grab more weights the sound starts to break up but the range isn't terrible, almost helps me remember to take my phone with me when I leave an area.Battery life is good and charging is really easy. May look a little bulky in the ear for some people but for me I like that it lets people know that I'm clearly listening to music and not just ignoring them. Good product for the price, already recommended it to friends:)

Pairs with Apple Watch for a great running experience!


No way I was spending over $60 on headphones, but all the 10 Best Headphones lists had headphones with jaw-dropping prices. So glad I got these. Fantastic fit (multiple ear bud sizes provided); rich, clear sound without the annoying bass boost intended for twenty-somethings who want to go deaf; multiple charging devices (dual port car charger, lightening port, and direct charge USB cable); firm protective carrying case;  and it pairs with the Apple Watch instantly. I can't believe I can go running with just my Apple Watch Series 2 and these...without my phone! I feel like I have a stereo system in my ears even with the volume on low. If you've been hunting for a great pair of headphones, look no further.

Not as good as the previous version


I lost my headphones which was the previous version of this set, in my opinion the old version was better. the cover for the USB charger never closed all the way, which doesn't change performance but was rather annoying. Additionally, it seems that they tried to cut costs on the piece that goes around your ear, this is a much thinner, more flimsy, and cheaper piece which does not hold as well onto the ear or hold its shape very well. Sound quality was slightly better than previous version though. Flimsy earpiece was a deal breaker for me, it felt like it was just dangling off my ears while I was working out and bothered me to the point of returning it, on top of the faulty USB port cover.

Fantastic value. Great battery life and a very reliable connection


These headphones have performed better than expected for this price point.  They sound much better than any other ear buds (wireless or wireless) that I have currently.  They sync quickly and easily.  The range us excellent. The only issue I have is that if you are using them to work out, the band that connects the left and right bud tends to stick to moist skin in the back of the neck. However, I discovered a fix. If I allow the band to hang down in the front this ceases to be a problem. Overall, this was a great purchase. I got a great Bluetooth headset that functions admirably yet I won't be too distraught if they are lost or stolen as they are reasonably priced and I'll just buy another one.

Didn't meet expectations


I expected these to be amazing because of the high reviews on Amazon, but they're nothing special..in my opinion. I've been using them for about a week while at the gym and at work. The fit isn't very comfortable, especially in the gym. I end up having to adjust my plugs during my workouts, which gets annoying.3-stars for nice accessories and good sound in quiet environments (work, home, etc.).*update* dropped to 2-stars because the poor frequency. I literally walked down my hallway from the kitchen and the ear buds started to lose reception. I'm surprised and confused as to why these received such high reviews.

Really good headphones for the price.


The headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good. The battery life is not that great but it can easily survive an hour of train ride to and from work which is all I need, I like the buttons on the headphones. You can change the volume, skip tracks, and play/pause the music using these buttons which is very convenient. The microphone is pretty decent. I don't really use the microphone to talk to people but whenever i did use it, I didn't receive any complaints from the other end. My voice was clear and they had no problems hearing me. But I have only used the microphone twice so I can't say how it will behave in crowded and loud places.The only negative is that it sometimes turns on on its own when it is in my pocket, which drains the battery. It will warn you more than once when the battery is low, which could get annoying if you are trying to enjoy the last few minutes of music.I looked at a lot of other headphones before buying these and I'm glad I went with these. They are really good headphones, specially for this price, My friends bought similar headphones for about $100 and the sound quality isn't that different when compared to those $100 headphones. I highly recommend these headphones for someone looking to buy headphones in $30-$50 range. They are even better than some more expensive headphones.

Very Surprised at the Great Quality


I've been wanting some bluetooth earbuds for a while but I didn't want cheap ones that didn't work well but also didn't have money to pay for the expensive good ones. I saw these on here a couple days ago and thought I would give it a shot. These earbuds are actually really good! They are noise cancelling which is nice.The packaging is really nice and it comes with a case, a card holder to stick to your phone, a car mount to stick in the vent, and more! They also come with these red foam ear pieces you attach to it and the sound quality gets even bettter!!! Very pleased with my purchase.

Overall good headphones for budget conscious person - you get what you pay for though


Sound quality is good.  Fit is not bad, I like the over the ear ones personally so not a lot of choices for those but they fit pretty well for ones that do not have an adjustment to them as some do.  No issues pairing, and easy to understand controls.  Did have headphones go unresponsive after 2 months, but Tekatron help was very responsive and took care of the issue immediately, great customer support.  Overall good headphones for budget conscious person.Originally was happy with these but after having them replaced now under warranty twice over 8 months, the third pair has gone out as well and I am pretty convinced that they don't hold up to sweat overly well.  The company this time around responded and suggested a ""reset"" procedure which does nothing when the headphones won't even charge anymore or turn on period, I tried to explain that but followed the procedure anyways to no luck of course.  Now they just won't respond to my emails anymore and I will find another brand to buy.  Maybe for the price it is fair to only get so many replacements under warranty, but just be aware that seems to be the case.

glad it was with Senso


My first experience with wireless earbuds, glad it was with Senso. First impression: everything was packed efficiently. There are extra earpieces and even a car charger. Second: the instructions were printed on quality paper and written clearly and concisely. The activating with my two devices took under 30 seconds total. I'm a near senior citizen and approach some new tech with a little trepidation, but Senso made it so easy. Now I'm rockin' wireless headphones! They're lightweight, with comfortable, flexible hooks to go over your ears (but don't interfere with glasses), and are intuitive to use. So far, the music is well-balanced and not bass-heavy, and the podcasts are clear. All this and a year warranty, too, at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.

Not a good product for runners


I'm disappointed that these headphones do not include some type of power charge indicator to help identify the amount of charge left in the battery. The headphones do provide an audio ""low power"" message - but just 10-15 minutes later, the device will shut off automatically. Common sense would dictate providing a ""low power"" warning much sooner.  By providing a ""low power"" message so late, the SENSO makers force the user to stop their activity immediately and find a power source.  This device is very poorly engineered.  CORRECTION:  While no power charge indicator is present on the headphones, a small icon is present on the phone, which should suffice. So I have upgraded my rating.

Great Sound, but Feedback when on the phone


Pros:  Great sound, comfortable over the ear, easy connecting to my devices, the buttons for volume and such were easy to work with.Cons:  I put the smallest earbud on but it never fit in my right ear well.  Left ear was great. (apparently my ears don't match! Who knew??) , when making phone calls, the person on the other end heard an echo.I really liked the earbuds and contacted them when I was having issues with an echo.  They responded with a possible solution right away.  The solution didn't work.  I did try to contact them again, but no response so I have decided to return them.  The sound on my end was great! Just wish it wasn't so annoying for the friend I was talking to.

Things Slowly Stopped working over the course of a month


I have had these headphones for almost a month now so I feel like I wanted to give my review. I read the reviews on the headphones before I bought them, but the positive reviews out-weighed the negative so I gave them I try! They were absolutely fantastic for about a week, but then things started to breakdown. The first thing to go was the “skip song” control on the headphones. You are supposed to be able to hit the (+) volume button twice to skip to the next song and (-) volume to go back a song. This worked for the first week. After that week, the volume control still works, but the headphones wont skip songs anymore. The second thing to go was the headphone case. It’s a nice case, but the zipper broke about two weeks into owning the headphones. So now I partially zip the case to hold them in, but the zipper stills peals apart.The most frustrating thing is the Bluetooth. They initially connected fine and worked great, however, as the weeks progressed they had more and more trouble connecting. I started having to turn my Bluetooth off then back on, or disconnect the headphones then reconnect them through the settings in my phone. The most frustrating day was today. I literally just finished a run and had terrible connectivity throughout. I tried turning the headphone on and off, tried reconnecting them in settings, tried turning my phone Bluetooth on and off, and even restarted my phone. But they still had trouble connecting. The music coming through them sounded like a skipping CD for the first half of my run. I got so annoyed that I turned them for the second half.When I finally save up for a new pair of Bluetooth headphones I will not be purchasing these again.

Great deal, better than the ""brand name."" Great Customer service.


Customer service is a 5, product is a 4. Would give 4.5 stars if I could. Had a pair that fit REALLY well (the over ear hooks had wire inside), but the bluetooth went out after a month. Senso sent another pair right  away, and the Bluetooth is MUCH better, although the hooks are more plasticy than the first pair. Having said that, the fit is really solid. It sometimes takes a few extra seconds for the headphones to REALLY connect (despite what the computer voice tells you) and once in a while I have to turn them off then on again to get them to connect to my iPhone. But overall these are a great bargin.

Great battery life, amazing sound and noise cancelling


These are favorite headphones hands down. The quality is excellent and very clear and will let you hear all songs the way they are meant to sound. They cancel noise extremely well so I usually have to leave one slightly out of my ear while at work so it's certainly does it's job there. I also use it all day at work and then the gym and battery still has juice. You can shake your head without these things coming off which is a huge plus for me. They also have a suorising amount of useful functions. The mic is great quality and nobody ever has a hard time hearing me and it reads the contact name and number of the person calling you. The last and final surprise is how much the package comes with. Love these headphones and already bought another as a gift and all my friends are getting them now.TLDR. AMAZING sound, mic, and stay on your ears. Great for gym and anything else.

Works well for 9 -10 months only!!


It worked well for 10 months or something. Then, first you will see minor problems like button for playing next song is not working. So for few months you will use phone to change song. You will feel its a minor fault and still be happy about it. Then, after few months around a year of buying, you will find now the volume is low. You will think, may be it was not charged well. Next time you charge well and viola volume is back to normal. Now after a year of buying, the volume will be permanently lower and the next song button not working. So, you will have to buy a new one now. Throw the junk, create more electronic garbage every year for lovely planet earth and again you are back to buying another one. May be they want to convey this is what you get in $30.Lesson: Good product if you want to put $30 every year. Or else buy a warranty and keep sending it back and forth. Basically, no peace for someone who wants to use only 1 hour of his day, 4 times a week during workout. I had higher hopes from it as I went for little more expensive one than many other cheaper products that were available. But now I regret my decision. I wouldn't buy it if its available even for $10 now.

Meh, at best.


Honestly, I was disappointed (and I started with reasonably low expectations, I thought).  The over-the-ear hook is simply too soft and flexible to offer much in the way of stabilization.  But the major problem I had was the poor BT performance; if I was wearing the headphones and then put my phone in my front-left pants pocket, the audio started to break up.  Taking the phone out of my left pocket, or putting the phone in my right pocket, and the audio cleared up.  Just holding the phone against my body on the left side was enough to cause problems.When the BT signal was clear, the audio performance was fine.  Nothing to complain about, and nothing to ""write home"" about.  Microphone performance was acceptable.Battery life was also poor.  After charging for 2 hours (seemed to be a full charge, based on the LED), I got approx 90 min of phone call and 30-45 min of listening to audio before it gave me the low-battery warning.  When the low-battery warning started, it was still reporting 30% charge.  It shut-off shortly thereafter.Honestly, I'm not returning them because, for the money, I'll keep them as a ""backup set"" and also use the car charger and combined microUSB / lightning cable.  I'm just going to order a different set and try those.

Fine product.  Excellent warranty back up.


Quite delighted w/product which I initially bought in Jul 2017 on sale from Amazon.  However, I had not used regularly and discovered after about 5 mos earphones had a defective port (connection would not stay properly seated and headphones would not recharge).  Called Senso and they took care of the issue promptly and courteously! Warranty was honored w/o hassle... sent brand new (in the box) headphones which I received w/in a few days w/attendant email follow ups. Kudos to them.  Also, comparatively easy to set up/bluetooth install.

Great Earset


I was looking for an earnest that has longer battery life than my existing earset.  I need to wear it sometimes for phone calls, sometimes for online internet news or videos, so this is a good one.  The sound is good and clear.  Bluetooth pairing is quick and easy. Earbuds are comfortable to my ears.  Price is much cheaper than Beats.  I haven't tried it during workout yet, but I don't think I will have any issues using it during workout.  All in all, I think this is a good deal.  I haven't seen any drawbacks so I give it 5 stars.

Worked great, sounded great and were easy to operate for ...


Although I really liked this product, I originally gave it a low review on Amazon because of a battery issue.  I intended to return the headphones to Amazon for a refund.  However, almost immediately after posting the review, I received an email from the president of Senso expressing his sincere apologies and stating that they would like to replace my headphones with a new set.  I replied and told him that I would be willing to do that.  Within a few hours, I received an email from Senso Support asking me to confirm my mailing address.  Long story short, I had a new set of headphones less than a week after I posted my original review.  Therefore, I am very appreciative of the excellent product support that I received from Senso!  Also, I do really like these headphones.  They sound great (excellent clarity), are easy to operate and very comfortable.  I wear them while using various cardio machines at the gym, and I hardly realize that I have them on.  They also come in a very nice carrying case and have several accessories included.  By the way, I am voluntarily changing this review for the reasons I just stated.

Amazing Sound & Great Price


I don't usually write reviews. But I absolutely love the sound quality of these headphones.  I bought them for walking &  jogging in the pool.  I listen to smooth jazz & the sound is lush. I hear not only the main instuments but the background nuances too. The range is incredible even. The sound is full-bodied. I was surprised as the cost was so reasonable and they sound as good or better as the more expensive ones.Cons: -Sometimes I have to keep adjusting to keep them comfortably on my ear.-I keep hitting the off/on button when I try & adjust them. Due to where its located.-I don't want to get out of the pool because music is sounding so darn good (that's more my problem)Bottom line, well worth the price & you'll love the sound quality.

Glad I invested in this updated version


Had Senso bluetooth earphones that I'd bought a few years ago and had been very happy with them, but lately they were cutting out and I didn't understand why, until I noticed I'd been basically mistreating them, not careful and tugging on the wire. Decided to purchase these, an updated version. The difference in updated quality was immediately noticeable. They pair up immediately, on/off and pause controls seem much better, and the earpiece that goes around the ear is easily moldable to the ear. Love these.

Poor Customer Service - Ignored Warranty Replacement


I bought these Senso Bluetooth Headphones in January 14, 2020.  This month (August, 2020) they quit working.  At first the functionality to adjust the volume and song selection quit working and then a few days later they completely died, and would not charge or power up.  I called the service phone line (888-683-4941) and they attempted to assist me in resetting the headphones, to no avail.  They recognized that they needed replaced and told me they were referring the problem to the warranty department and I would be contacted in 3 days. . .NOT.  I have called the service line 3 times and sent 3 separate e-mails to the warranty department (2 thru there web interface and 1 directly from my e-mail account) and HAD ZERO RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST FOR REPLACEMENT!If you want a headphone with a warranty DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!

Terrific value, great performance for the price


They are cheap wireless headphones, but I frequently find myself reaching for them instead of by Jaybirds. They aren't perfect, but they stay in, there's a bit of wind noise when I run and the mic is not great. However, if all you want to do is listen to music while working out, they are solid.The main things I like about them are how well they stay on, and how comfortable they are. In both cases, superior to my Jaybird X3s. Sound quality, mic, charge, is another story. But they are a decent headphone for a great price!

Died after 5 months (Manufacturer Replaced, though)


** Update ** The manufacturer replaced my faulty pair with minimal fuss (just a few emails exchanged). Replacement arrived quickly, and work well. I take it back about Senso!I bought these 5 months ago. They're already dead, after fairly light usage on my part. The sound is decent - not amazing, but good for the price. The bluetooth can be a little sketchy - I frequently had to disconnect and then reconnect to my iPhone.But hey, that's all irrelevant now - these things don't even last through the summer.

Great Product. Fantastic Value!


These wireless buds are fantastic. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have a discerning ear and I know what sounds cheap. These definitely do not.- Amazing value for the price. I'd pay $60 easy for these.- Very comfortable to wear. Been using these for workouts and listening to music while I work (I'm an artist) and they're solid. Never felt uncomfortable or got that ""sweaty ear"" feeling in my ear canal.- Sound is bass-heavy with clear mid tones and highs. I like bass, so I don't mind it at all. Very happy with the way they sound right out of the box. I've also never had to turn the volume up all the way, as the isolation from the buds does a great job of keeping out excessive outside noise. I frequently work outside with my tablet, so it's nice to just drown it all out for a bit.- Finally, I really appreciate all the extra little bits you get in the box. The case is great. It's where I keep the charging cable and other ear pieces. And the dual purpose (mini USB/lightning) cigarette lighter charging adapter is already being utilized in my car.Senso, thank you for a great product and package!!!

These are great! I bought a pair to use at the gym. Sometimes I'm lazy and I want to do cardio on the treadmill for an hour. Other times I like to get into beast mode and lift weights. These are quite liberating regardless of exercise I'm doing. I just set my phone down next to my water bottle and focus on my workout. The only down side is the red one is about $10 cheaper than the black or grey ones. I HATE red. I just wish I wasn't cheap. Maybe when these die I'll invest the extra $10 bucks for a better color.

The sound quality is mediocre at best, but that isn't to say it's bad


The sound quality is mediocre at best, but that isn't to say it's bad. You can't expect excellent music for this price, but again I'm not dissatisfied on that point. The bass is pretty good if you appreciate that. The battery life is also mediocre. I can listen for around 5-6 hours before it needs a charge. If you run for thirty minutes that's two or three weeks on one charge. I do hobby woodwork in the garage and is fantastic at noise canceling. I can hear my music fine over the table saw and router. They fit my ears pretty well. If I go for a run I don't have to adjust very often. Good deal for the price.

These headphones are a MUST have.  The sound quality is great for music, video streaming, and phone calls.  In fact, I answered a call with them on and the caller couldn't even tell I was on Bluetooth, wish I could say the same about my car.They come with 3 ear cushion sizes, car charger, wall charger, caring case.  They have a really long lasting charge.  I wore them for 6 hours straight and they were still going strong.  They also seem to hold a charge for a long time, going a few days without charging and then they started right up.  They're awesome at the gym, sweat doesn't make them slide or fall out, and the hooks that go over the ears are very comfortable.If you're not technical, don't worry, pairing them takes seconds, and is super easy.I highly recommend these.

Great headphones, stellar service


To update my initial review, I started hearing out of only one earbud, so i emailed for support. The same day I had a reply with a detailed process to troubleshoot by reverting to factory settings, then reconnect with my iPhone. Withing 10 minutes the problem was reolved, and i didn't even have to wait for a new set to come by mail. More great service!I love these earbuds; they not only solved my problem with the iPhone 7's new headphone input, so I can charge it while listening, but also allow me to control audiobooks and music I listen to without having to fiddle with the phone at all. Just touch a control button on the right earpiece to change volume, move forward or back, power on and off. The sound quality is excellent for the price and I was able to stay connected to my iPhone 7+ while walking the length of the house and several walls away. The package with a free car charger and carrying case make these buds an insane value for $37. About four months in, they just stopped working inexplicably. I emailed the company on a Sunday and got a response within minutes! When their troubleshoot couldn't fix them, they sent out a replacement product the same day. So as much as I like the product and was disappointed that they stopped working, I give them an A+ for customer service.

Product ROCKS!!!


Just what the doctor ordered! I'm a Beats man, with several pairs of the cordless and cord headsets and I was actually shopping for a new set, since the sets I have don't hold a charge for more than 2hrs. However, when I saw the price for this set I purchased 3 of them. I felt that if they were garbage, then I wouldn't be so much of a loss. Nevertheless, these things ROCK and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for amazing sound, quality, and above all price. This set actually brings a car charger, and cords for both Android and IPhone!! Who does that???!!! This company ROCKS hands down...

Good quality headphones with minor issues


I've been putting these headphones through a lot of activities since I bought them, so far they've delivered everything in the product's description. They have a really good battery life, sound quality is good, sweat/water proof, easy to connect and they don't fall out during rigorous activity.  I put them on for 15 minutes of jump roping, running 7 miles, weight lifting, doing various household choirs and showered with them in.  All on a single charge. I've only had 2 issues with them so far 1. The piece that holds them to your ear is really rubbery and I was hoping it would be at least somewhat rigged, but it does it's job still. 2.  When I took them to the gym the gym was packed at the headphone were experiencing interference whenever I was too close to someone else with Bluetooth headlhones.Edit: had them for a few months now and they have steadily declined. They used to last for a few days on a charge but now I'm lucky to get 3 gym sessions out of them. There isn't a way to tell how charged they are other than fully charged or dead. And they recently started just beeping when attempting to turn them on. I lowered my rating of a 4 to a 2 because of these issues and how short of a time it took for these issues to build up.

I received the item and it was exactly as described. The packaging was really nice along with the little carrying case that came with them. The sound is great and they seem very comfortable. I am not sure yet how long the battery last as I haven't used them until a recharge is needed but so far used them a little over two hours and still no need for a recharge. I am not sure if the car charging adapter and cable were listed as being included but it was a great surprise for me especially since the end of the cable has both usb and iPhone adapter not to mention it is tangle free which was an excellent choice. Would definately recommend these two a friend.

These are pretty good headphones


These are pretty good headphones. The memory foam ear tips are awesome. Most headphones will slowly begin to slip out of my ears as I run, but the memory foam tips are large enough to keep the headphones in place while I'm running. I cannot say enough about how great the customer service is. I damaged one of the memory foam ear tips while trying to take it off to clean it, so I contacted the company to see if it was covered under the warranty. It was and they sent me 2 sets of replacement memory foam ear tips! I emailed the company and literally got a response within minutes. The product is solid, the sound is great, they connect very easily to my devices, and seem to charge quickly and hold their charge for a long time.

Still working after running them over with my 1/2 ton truck!


Pros: fits well, good for running, comfortable fit, good volume range, connects to Bluetooth instantly, no audio/video lag when watching videos over Bluetooth, calls are clear, range is decent, and battery life is decent (about 8 hours and charges quickly with any micro-USB charger).Cons: audio/sound quality is just okay. Not a crystal clear sound. Too much bass (had to adjust the sound on my phone to have almost no bass and it's still high bass).I really can't complain for the price, it's a better product than I expected for the price. It's a good buy and decent product so far (only had them for 2 weeks).2 year update: they're still working well and holding a charge (about 8 hour average). I accidentally ran them over in my rock driveway.. they still work, but the audio quality is shot.. had to glue them back in place, but other than the fact they look like trash now... They still work.. not good enough to use as the sound quality is on par with a CB radio on a dirty channel. I think I got my $20 worth and would easily recommend these to anyone looking for budget wireless earbuds. (6/6/19).

They're <$40, with 7k reviews for a 4.5+ star rating.  Why are you still reading reviews cheap***


They mirrored the Beats earbuds design, but at an absolute fraction of the cost.  They are just as nice as the Beats (I have now had 4 pairs of Beats and tired of them breaking every few months.  Fool me once...fool me twice...)I decided to give these a shot since they were highly rated (7k+ people can't be wrong, right?).  The case is nice and fits well into a computer bag, the battery life is good, and they stay in my ears during hard workouts.  The one thing to be careful on when you first get them, until you remember not to do it, is not to push the earbuds in by touching the gray button on the outer surface while you are on a phone call.  It will drop the call!  More my fault than anything.  4 out of 5....5 stars is perfect, and I just don't think anything is perfect.  There is always room for improvement.

Good product at this price point.


Easy to get hooked up to Bluetooth, the instructions were very good. The ONLY negative thing I find about them is that the earbuds don't fit real well in my ears. I am an average female, and changed to the smallest buds, but the fit is not great. The angle that they fit in isn't quite right for my ears. The sound is awesome when I press the earbuds in really well with the palm of my hand, but that's not a real comfortable way to go about my business.

Screw your Apple headphones


This is what I tell my husband.This is my second pair of Senso bt headphones. I tossed the first pair recently, after about a year and a half of use, because I lost one of the ear cushions. Now, my husband and I are very careful about budgeting for miscellaneous purchases that are around the $50 or above mark. After I told him I needed a new pair he asked me what would be more important on the Wish list we have going... New running shoes or new headphones. HA!Darling, my headphones cost $20.To which he responds, ""Nooo, you should get the new Apple ones, they're great!""Here's the thing friends... These headphones.. I've never had an issue with them connecting. I've never thought poorly of the sound quality. The new ones I just got, MOLD TO MY TINY EARS. Tiny ear people, hi - I see you. Regardless, until the Apple headphones last as long as my $20 Senso headphones for the same value... i e. When you're $159 headphones last 7.95 years.. and you've never lost them, they've never faulted and something better didnt catch your eye in that time... then Screw Your Apple Headphones... respectfully.

Audio qualtity is good, but Connectivity and Range issues makes it a no go  UPDATE: All good now


2/5For the price they're okay. The audio quality is pretty good and I can clearly hear the layers in the music I'm listening to. Like others have said the sound volume itself is good too. I have it on standard default volume and can hear everything perfectly fine. I kind wish I could push them more into my ear, but that can't be helped and they're still pretty comfortable. I don't know if I would call them noise canceling because I can still hear the music at my gym if I don't have my own music playing. They do block some outside noise though. Wind going by my ears when I'm outside is a tad annoying since it makes a rustling noise like a mic being blown on, but since I'm inside the gym using them, it's not a big factor for me. The battery life last a good time, so I'm happy with thatNow the biggest issue that causing me to give it a low rating is the range and connectivity. It connects perfectly fine and fast when my phone is within visual sight like if I'm holding my phone in my hand or have my phone,  HTC One, next to me when I'm on a bench. However, it has a terrible time if anything obstructs my phone like even in my pocket, it still cuts the audio in and out. Like these aren't thick pants I'm wearing, just gym shorts. Not to mention it basically doesn't work at all in my left pocket and I have to have it in my right pocket.  I'm guessing the signal connection comes from the right earbud and it can't find a good path connection around to the phone and gets completely blocked by my body. I guess it tries to go diagonally though my body. If I have my hand down by my side with my wrist, I'll mention I have thin arms and wrists, over my pocket where my phone is, it also gets blocked out and no audio comes out (sometimes it'll just disconnect because the signal gets so weak). The range is also nothing to write home about even in eye sight. like I can only go like 4ft away before the audio starts to skip. Past 5ft it's really weak and cuts out constantly, which on the item description it says it should be good for 30ft.  It's just not convenient to have to worry about moving myself and adjusting all these little things so the audio doesn't disconnect or skip. I really don't think the problem is my phone either because I've had other bluetooth headphones in the past and their range was really far and didn't have this problem with audio cutting in and out when in my pocket.Would I recommend this to a friend or buy again? No, try something else.UPDATE: So after messaging the company, they graciously were able to fix the situation. I guess I got a bad set and Senso was able to send me a new pair or earbuds that function properly now. Senso was very quick to respond to my emails and were absolutely dedicated to help me with that range issue I had before. A couple days later, I now have my new pair and they work really well without problems. I can now say I recommend them because of their great service.

Great buy


First time buyer of Senso products. I was very surprised by the quality of the product. The wireless headphones arrived with its own carry case, 1 short USB charge wire, 1 long ( I think 24"") charge wire that can be used to charge the earbuds and iPhone, car charger converter with two USB output ports (1A, 2.1A), and different size replacement ear fittings.I also received another surprise, communication via email from the company offering 24/7 phone support support and requesting feedback.In the past two weeks I used the earbuds at work, metro, and while running/exercising. The average use time 6-8 hours per day.The first thing worth to note, the Bluetooth range is awesome. In the past I had a few wireless earbuds and their range was terrible. With these earbuds, by accident, I discovered that at approximately 10-15m from my phone they still picked up my iPhone signal and played music perfectly.The microphone quality is so so. Sometimes people on the other side of the phone conversation complained of my voice not being loud enough. I am not too concerned about that especially considering that I purchase them for listening to music while working or running.I also do not have (so far) any issue with battery. I consider them to be a great buy at the current price level.

It's okay


I'm glad to finally have wireless headphones so I can walk around talking on the phone without having to pick up my phone. However, you have to bring the phone into the same room with you or you will start to lose signal and get the weird alien voice the moment you step out. Also, the part that originally attached that goes into your ear is way too big and gave me sores on my ear before I switched to the smaller set.Watch out and make sure to turn them off and bluetooth off when you're not using them because they have drained my phone battery till it dies if I forget.

Not the greatest bluetooth signal reception if there's other radios around.


The state of the battery charge seems to have a big effect on how well they receive the bluetooth signal. The bluetooth signal is prone to interference from other radio signals, and that's VERY annoying at best. I'm an old(er) guy and have hairy ears. They don't stay in well, as I expected . They do sound fine when they're working well and fitting well. I don't expect good bass response from earbuds under any circumstances. These don't exceed that expectation, and when they fail to stick in my hairy ears it's even worse.

Poor product


DON’T ORDER! I bought these to use while exercising.  I had decent “luck” with them in the past.  They either failed within a few weeks or lasted 18 months or so.  If they failed in the warranty period I was able to get them replaced.  Sound was decent and if I got 18 months from the product it was worth the price.  However when these failed I called for support was told I would receive an email with instructions.  It never came.  I called again.  Same result although I was promised the device would be replaced.  Family member who had also tried these had similar results.

Great product, even better service!


This product for this price is just amazing! What's more amazing is the customer service they have.So, no wonder this amazing product with such amazing customer service has found a place in Amazon!Seriously, I bought a two headsets recently - one for me and one for my son - to make sure we don'tbother each other with loud TV. The quality of sound is just great. It can match many of the expensiveheadsets in the market. The battery life is great. You can watch almost two full length movies. Chargingis very fast. Range of Bluetooth allows me to go to bathroom to take  leak without having to reconnect.But what I was most happy about was their prompt customer service. One night I found it was notconnecting to Bluetooh transmitter of my TV. I was going to try out a few things, but I sent an emailto their customer service, just in case. They responded back within 4 hours. I was given some instructionsto try out. I tried but couldn't get Bluetooth to work and let them know about it. Within the same day, theysent me mail telling me not to worry because I was covered by their one year warranty and then, I gota mail saying that they have already shipped me a new one! I'm waiting for the new one to arrive but,couldn't wait to write this review because I have to be honest for once and say, ""Hey, this is a great product andwhat's more, their service is even better!""

I love these earbuds (for the price)


Looking for wireless gym headphones? You found them. I love these earbuds (for the price). They came with a really dope charging cable that accommodates the earbuds and my iPhone in the same cable- something I haven't seen before. They charge fully in about 90 minutes and will last me about 5-6 gym workouts that vary anywhere between 40 and 90 minutes. In addition, they include a dual port car charger and another mini usb charging cable. Excellent value for sure! I cannot speak to the longevity of the product, I can however say that for the price they have excellent sound quality and stay in my ears while playing basketball. Kinda creepy how easily/clear the calling is. Probably better than actually using the phone by itself. Unless you're looking for very high end headphones, I can't see anyone being unsatisfied with their purchase.

Echoes


Using the Senso, I am able to hear clearly and the audio is decent.The buds remain in my ears for the most part. I did not like the feel of the cord hanging on my neck and the cord would also get in the way of my glasses at times, because I would hang my glasses on the front collar of my shirt at times. Other downsides are that those I called complained of hearing an echo whenever they would speak to me. I had the LG-750 and the charge lasted me at least two days, but the Senso battery, fully charged, barely lasted a day. I would not purchase Senso Bluetooth Headphones again; at least not this type. I am not altogether upset with the product, because I took a risk by trying something different.

Lasted about 7 months...


I wanted to (at least) have either 1 year of regular use, or the product breaking down, before posting a review of it.  I purchased these headphones in late October to replace a pair of Soundpeats headphones that only lasted me 6 months.  These SENSO headphones lasted only a month longer (7 months).  They stopped working on me mid-workout today and no longer charges when its cord is plugged into a USB port.  I use them about 4 times/week for about 1.5 hours/use while working out in the gym.  My workout consists of using the elliptical trainer and stretching afterwards.  After using the unit, I wipe them down with a soft towel and them stow them away in the soft case included.  I have limited experience with owning ""gym type"" (as advertised) bluetooth headphones, but given that designation, I assumed that they have some sort of water resistant/repellant/protection capability and that given some TLC, they would last (at least) a year.  This one almost made it.  I guess it's time to shop for some new bluetooth headphones.

Better than my wildest hopes


My hope when getting these was that maybe they wouldn't totally suck. I did not have high hopes for my first set of Bluetooth headphones. I am not an optimist.They're awesome. The sound quality is better than any headphones I've ever had, I think. They are comfortable and secure in my ears. They hold the charge well. I was hoping for a little freedom from my phone at the gym, but when they're completely charged, they transmit well enough for me to grab water or a tower or whatever. When the charge is slipping, you can tell because the signal weakens at closer distances, but we're still talking 10' instead of 20'.They are very intuitive and easy to use for me. They connect with my Droid Maxx2 very quickly and easily. Really, I love them. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I think they're awesome.

Either I got a faulty pair, or they are not nearly as sweat proof as advertised.


I purchased these a little over a month ago. I used these three times, and during the third workout, it cut out about 10 minutes into the workout. I figured it must have been that I had failed to adequately charge the buds or something, so I took them home and tried to recharge. The red indicator light came on, showing that it was still functioning to some degree. Later, with the indicator lights blue, I grabbed them for another workout, but could never get it to turn on (i.e., I never heard the 'power on' command).I don't sweat a ton, but I sweat, so getting headphones that can stand up to a little moisture is key to me. The time between the first and third workout that I used them was over a week (i.e., not heavy/daily usage), so it's not like there was heavy usage over a short period of time. It was basically 2.5-3 hours of usage, total, over 7-8 days, spread out, and they've stopped working. I get that these are relatively inexpensive, but I was expecting at least a year of regular usage before they conked out on me.I will add that the packaging and the accessories it comes with are nice, and in terms of fit and build quality, they're fairly comfortable and feel pretty solid. Sound quality is nothing exceptional, but there's enough dynamic range that it doesn't sound cheap (solid, but unspectacular). Obviously, as 'sport' headphones, the thing you're hoping for is that they can hold up to a workout. I wouldn't recommend these based on my experience.

Don't fit very well in big ears, loud wind noise when outside due to bulkiness


These headphones generally work, but they have a few issues.  They don't fit very well in my ears.  They stay in OKAY, but I find myself pushing them back in every 5 or 10 minutes, which gets old after a while.  I think they just don't have a long enough ear piece, so if you have big ears, or long ear canals, they can't get fully lodged/positioned in the ear, even with the largest size ear tips, because the large circular backdrop of the earbud prevents them from getting far enough into the ear.  In addition, due to their bulkiness, when I run outside there is a really bad wind noise that drowns out the music, even when it's not that windy out.

Awesome value, awesome sound.


I bought these in 2017. They lasted a long time until I broke them while on my motorcycle. That was my fault. I’ve tried a few other ones since then and they don’t measure up. These are the best and such a good value! That’s why I’m back and just ordered my second pair today. Another important point. The volume on these is really good. I can have these on while riding my motorcycle and it’s better volume than having my Apple AirPod pros on. In fact, much better. Just so you know. 5 Stars.

Good potential, but final review is TBD.


The headphones are a good buy if they would have continued working. The sound is decent for the money, and they are comfortable. But after just 6 weeks of light use they no longer work.. I started having issues with the pairing being lost, and finally the Multi-function button lost its spring tension and will not turn on. I will try to contact the manufacturer for assistance and see how they handle defective products. I will write a follow up review after they have been given sufficient time to respond. As of now I can only give 3 stars, which is probably over rating it considering the limited use. The follow up:The company responded quickly and offered a replacement without delay. The replacement is working fine, and I am using it at the gym and while running. As of now, I am very happy with the product and the seller. 5 stars for the value and service.

Big disappointment


I did hours of research before I bought these headphones and am so disappointed! The good aspects are that they were comfortable on my ears and didn't fall out. The other good is the company was very responsive when I emailed my problems, The problems? Reception deteriorated when I was 10 feet away from my phone but in the same room. Controls very difficult to feel and to use. Charging port didn't work. No way to tell how much charge is left.  No mute function. Noise cancelling very limited. I ended up returning them and buying LG Tone Pro 770, which is an ""around the neck"" bluetooth set up, great to use, just $5 more than Senso.

Great Fit and Functionality


Love these new headphones. Took about 2 hrs to charge out of the box last night.  That matched what the instructions stated.  I bought them  because I did not want to  use my expensive BOSE headphones on the beach on vacation.  Paired first phone but had problem with second phone until I realized the headphones were still connected to first phone.  Once I turned off first connection, they easily pared to second phone.  Lots of ""goodies"" come with product: . +12v car charger, extra ear pieces, duel charger cable for lightening and micro usb connector, standard micro usb to usb charger cable.  They fit great compared to Apple ear buds which constantly fall out of my ears.  These Senso headphones fit over the ear, are very light wt.  and are very comfortable.  Sound was fine.  On/Off and Volume buttons very functional.  Not sure how long the play time will be but so far they are great

Good While They Last


I ordered these headphones in April 2017. In February 2017 they started to malfunction. First, one of the earbuds stopped working. Then, after a week or so they started dropping the connection with my phone. I would only be able to listen for about 10 seconds before having to reconnect them. I called their customer service and filed a warranty claim. A new pair was sent out and arrived within days. A little over a year later and I am having the same connectivity issues.I will say that they are great earbuds - with a 12 month shelf-life. Not very expensive, but still... I don't want to have to be replacing my earbuds every year. I am thinking that I will invest a little more into headphones that I can keep around for more than one trip around the Sun. Good sound quality, cancels noise, lightweight, and easy to pair. Purchase at your own risk.

I sent them back 3 times before simply giving up.  I read the amazing reviews and decided to give Senso a try... Boy am I glad I did.

Great Sound Quality Headphones


I bought the Senso Bluetooth Headphones to pair with a MP3 player which I had purchased for my wife. According to my wife, the Senso headphones are perfect for her. Charged the headphone set, turned the power on, paired with the MP3 player by pressing the connect icon on the player, played away.The sound quality is great, and the range in our house is about 25-30 feet from the player which I think is very good, as my wife is never more than a few feet when she is at work from her player.Very happy with the Senso Bluetooth headphones and recommend if you are looking for a product with great sound to check these out.

Don't use these outside.


2 problems with these headphones. 1. The blutooth is very weak. If you are indoors at a gym, then they are fine. If you go outside, then something interferes with the signal, and the sound gets real choppy. 2. If you are outside and the wind blows, you get a lot of wind noise coming through the headphones. I have a different set of blutooth headphones, and those don't do that. In addition, my other set has no problem with interference outdoors. If you are only going to use these inside, they are OK.  If you are walking from your car to the gym, then the sound will break up.

Average sound, quality has gone down from earlier design.


This is my second pair of SENSO Headphones.  My first stopped working just after a year and customer service basically told me I was out of luck since it was past the year warranty, but gave me a 10% coupon.  I really liked my first pair, so I thought I'd give SENSO another try.  It looks like the manufacturing process has changed.  These looked the same as the first pair in the picture, but the material used is now different.  The ear pieces used to be a soft rubber-like material that was very comfortable.  Now they are a cheaper plastic material.  The sound quality is just alright.  I think this will be my last pair of SENSO headphones.

My biggest issue is pairing it to my devices. I use these with both a tablet and phone. I can only connect to one if I ""forget this device"" on the other FIRST. I cannot force these to pair with a different device once it has paired. Once I ""forget this device"" it pairs easily. This is a huge pain when I have it paired to my phone on the way to the gym. Then I power them off, change, and lock it in my locker. When I try to pair my tablet, I can't. I have to go back to my locker, ""forget this device"" on my phone to allow me to pair with my tablet.HUUUUUGE pain in the neck!The noise cancelling in negligible.

Excelent bundle for the price!


These are pretty good. The sound quality and base are both great, and they shouldn't leave you wanting for much more, despite the price and quality assurances of name brands.I found it easier to both put on and wear these with the strap in front like a sombrero rather than across the back like bifocals. Easier to turn the head without the strap getting snagged, as well as being less awkward to put on.Battery life is good so far, as is volume and comfort. Connects quickly after the first time. The voice could be a bit more natural sounding, and the volume buttons should've been switched, but these are minor niggles.If you must have something that'll better impress the Jones, then go for LG's HSB-810 model with retractable earbuds and JBL sound. But it'll definitely cost you more new, and you won't get all the awesome freebies.

When she starts sweating during her run they start to slip off and even when she hasn’t started her workout no matter how much we have tried to squeeze them or push them back they do not stay on the car. The buds that go in the ear (or whatever you call it) are also not that comfortable for long use and the sound quality isn’t that great. I’d skip these and look for something better. It’s dissapointing because I got her these for Christmas and she can’t enjoy them.

Great Sound Quality, Comfortable


5 stars because you're not going to get more for your money.  I've avoided wireless earbuds for a long time because I like my music loud and clear.  But cords got caught one too many times, so I went shopping and found these.The sound quality of these SENSO Bluetooth buds is just as good as the wired buds that come with the iPhone 7.  Bluetooth pairing was simple.  It comes with 4 earpiece sizes and I found one size that fit just right.  They are comfortable and they keep a charge for hours (they also charge very quickly).  I'd buy them again

Excellent Customer Service


I really enjoy using the Senso ActivBuds. I had been using the Senso ActivBuds S-250 for about two months when the right microphone stopped working. I contacted customer support after hours and received immediate feedback on how to fix the problem. I was not able to fix the problem so a replacement was immediately shipped to me. I am so impressed with Senso's fast response and willingness to honor the one-year warranty. I recommend the ActivBuds not just for quality and great performance but a responsive customer service team. Thank you Senso.

Does not include listed accessories and the newer pair costs less! Disappointing.


I'm definitely a little disappointed. It came with different accessories than what's listed. The lightning charger was part of why I went with this pair, but instead they came with a car vent mount. I also found out right after receiving this pair that the company has a new and improved version which they actually sell for considerably less.The quality of sound is pretty good, although there is a loud painful beeping noise that happens any time I turn the volume up. Clicking the multi function button on the side is also very uncomfortable and unpleasant. The fit is good and they are fairly comfortable, although a bit clunky.

The most recent one I had when you turned it on it said ""power on"" at max volume. Haha yea that was annoying but I rate senso close to sennheiser and the battery life is awesome I've had close to 6 of them I think I'm bad about losing and accidentally braking headsets that's where their super low cost is awesome I typically spent 75$ or more on wired sennheiser and these bluetooth are 30$ I'm a happy customer just ordered the wireless ones because I accidentally broke my last corded bluetooth. Anyway figured I should leave a review yea got one messed up one out of many but still loyal

Great Headphones


Great price great sound!Update 12/2018 ***  I bought these headphones twice I lost the first pair.  But I loved them so much I bought a second pair in March of 2018.  For the last two month the left side has had static feedback.  Now the left side is going out and this unfortunately disables the Bluetooth and my music starts playing out loud.  Since I primarily use these at work they are basically no good anymore.  Can someone tell me how to go about getting a replacement pair since they are still under the 1 year warranty?  I wrote Tekatron a few days ago and have not heard back as yet.Thanks!

GREAT for indoor use....a lot of wind noise when used outside


If you use them for indoor use, I highly recommend them.  I am torn with these because I love them but there is a lot of wind noise when I use them outside.  I walk 3 miles in the morning and the park I walk in is wide open.  The wind noise through these is bad.  I did not even think to look into that b/c this is my first set of earbuds with a microphone.  I did not realize that a microphone you can't turn off means wind noise.  So...long story short....for use inside like in a gym....BUY BUY BUY!  If you are a runner, walker, work outside, etc....find one where you can turn off the microphone.

Barely okay sound, but decent comfort. Gets the job done.


The headphones are easy to charge, easy to pair, and comfortable to use. Their sound quality is okay at best. My very old Asus laptop, my bare-bones Lenovo laptop, and my Nexus 6P phone all have better audio quality than these headphones. The range is not there, and everything seems skewed too much to the high range (no matter what I do with an equalizer the sound is too high and tinny, with anemic low ranges). And the volume control is pretty wild -- either it's rather quiet, or (one click up) deafening. There is no in between.I use these for listening to music while working out. They stay on my ear (though not always in my ear, even with the correct tips, but that's likely because I'm sweating like a monster), but the sound quality is pretty rough. So they're adequate (barely) for working out, as long as you don't care that the sound quality is rather poor. If you care about actually hearing your music or feeling the beat, these are not for you.If I could, I'd give them a 2.5/5.

FANTASTIC purchase. Great sound quality


I’d give 5 stars if they really were noise cancelling.  It’s merely the fit of the headphones that kinda reduce background noise.  However, for the price, FANTASTIC purchase.  Great sound quality.  A little light on the bass but that is to be expected with buds.  I like the fact I can put them on and walk around my entire house and yard.  Range is much better than advertised.  Easy set up and connection with my devices.  Very nice semi hard case to store and plenty of charging options/cables included.  Small/med/lrg buds to fit your ears.  Overall. For the price point, I have no real complaints.

So far I like them a lot


So far I like them a lot, and it seems to be a very good product at a very reasonable price.  They are my first set of wireless headphones, and I'm not yet thrilled with the idea of having to re-charge them, but it sure is nice not to have to deal with long wires.  For me, I'd say that the fit is descent.  They do tend to rotate forward in my ear a bit an loosen up, but that may just be my ears.  I wish that the cord was a bit shorter.  It does come with a little wire tie to shorten it up, but it keeps falling out.  The package comes with a quite a lot of other extras, including a case, two additional different size in-ear pieces ear pieces, a short charger, and then a car charger and longer charger.  I honestly haven't been able to figure out how you would use the longer charger with the headphones.  All in all, though, they seem like a very good buy.

Good value but sound quality is lacking


These headphones are a good value but if you are looking for high end sound quality I would not recommend them.  They do deliver good loud sound and the quality of the materials seems good for the money but there is distortion when the volume is high and even at lower volume levels the sound is just muddled.  I'm no sound engineer but I am a musician and if I play the same song through my air pods they blow these headphones away. Obviously there is a $125 difference in price so that has to be factored in.

Better than the others you were looking at


Ordered a set of these for my wife as a ""test"" to see if she'd really like wireless headphones with the full intention of buying her a different set of really pricey ones (don't want to use the name but it rhymes with ""meats"") if she did like going wireless.Three days later she says she loves her sensos and doesn't want the others. I try to explain that the sound will be so much better, blah blah blah and she says, ""listen to them.""I do. Two days after that I ordered a second set for me. These are fantastic. Sound quality is impeccable, battery life solid. Light weight, comfortable and worked great even after my seven year old stepped on them.Can't recommend highly enough, and TWO sets of these cost roughly the same as I would have spent on the... meats.

Good sound but would not stay on properly


The sound was actually pretty good when they stayed in my ears. The problem I had was if I moved at all they would loosen up and then in the process of pushing them back in my ear I'd hit the control button pausing the music. I tried 2 gym sessions with 2 different sized buds before giving up and sending back. I spent more time messing around with getting them to stay on my ears than actually working out...which is annoying. I've been happily using a cheapo pair of Philips with a similar design so was disappointed when these didn't work out. I think if the ear hook was sturdy vs flimsy they would have stayed on and been great.

the BEST pair of bluetooth in-ear headphones on the market


This is, without a doubt, the BEST pair of bluetooth in-ear headphones on the market, and an untouchable value, especially given the price. I had the PowerBeats Wireless 3s and after a few of the silicon earbuds came off and got lost, I lost the headphones themselves. I was going to buy new Beats, and I saw these SENSO headphones for $35 with stellar reviews. I was reluctant to buy them, but now that I have them and have used them, I feel they are such a superior value, that I need to share my feedback to possibly save a few folks from spending $155 on a pair of Powerbeats wireless 3s. Here are my remarks, in order of what I believe to be the highest priorities, and in comparison to the only other headphones of this kind which I've used:- SUPERIOR sound quality (giant exclamation point) and pretty ridiculous volume capability. More than loud enough at half volume. Beats can't go this loud nor produce sound like this.- Confirmed noise cancelling. Not sure how they accomplish this, but there is a noticeable noise cancelling quality to the sound.- Great in-ear buds. Silicon earbuds which stay in during high intensity exercise (tried and tested). Also, the ear hooks are very pliable and flexible. *I noticed this especially in comparison to the Beats. The Beats hooks are somewhat rigid and can become disfigured with too much pressure (think about putting them in a gym bag).- Solid battery life. 8 hours of run-time, can remain on standby for longer than you'll probably ever forget to turn them off, and they charge in 90 minutes.- Great bluetooth connectivity. Calls are crystal clear.- Instead of deciphering sound effects when the headphones turn on and when they connect to a device, like Beats PB3, when the SENSO buds turn on, you'll hear ""Power on"", then ""Connected"" when they connect.- Comes with great accessories. A great carrying case which is small and compact, dual port car charger, 2 charger wires of different lengths and with a protective case over them (great add-on), 2 wire ties, and 3 pairs of extra buds. All this comes in a tiny little box.. probably 7"" x 5"" x 3"".- The controls are a bit confusing to get used to. For instance, scrolling through music tracks is done by holding the respective volume button for a full second (vol. up for next track, down for previous). This is not QUITE as easy as clicking the button on the Beats twice or 3 times, but I like these better in regard to the layout, because the connecting wire between the 2 buds has no device attached, so it's just a smooth wire minus the wire tie.Highly recommend these over any headphones of their kind!

Outstanding performance at a fraction of the cost of the big names.


Phenomenal. For the price I paid, you will not find a better sounding set of ear buds. My co worker had the Beats version which pretty much lol the same and these sound better than his. Especially in the mid range. Responsive bass, doesn't bottom out or distort. Super comfortable and well made. I've used for a total of about 6 hours so far and I'm still on the first charge. Comes loaded with charging accessories, different sized soft rubber tips, and a nice carrying case. After seeing all the reviews, once they went on sale I jumped on them especially with prime.

Great headset and good price


I am brutal on headsets.  I average 40-60 hours/week using them with phone, text transcripts and audiobooks.  My headsets usually break or lose functions w/in 3 months.  I bought this Senso waterproof headset w/ my 1st additional warranty on July 10, 2017 expecting it to die.  To my surprise, in addition to regular work related use, it lasted over 9 months of heavy outdoor use in rain, pools, rafting, jogging, etc.  It still works great for listening to audio.  The only intermittent issue is that its microphone was coming in too faint for people on the phone line to hear well on some phone calls.  Since most of my work is done over the phone, this wasn't good.  I emailed Senso and they sent me a replacement.  I still have the old one for a back up and am using it now.It is by far the most resilient, comfortable, multipurpose headset I've owned of at least 15 that I've used.  The range is about 15-30 feet which is the same as other headsets and likely a bluetooth limit.  The over ear fit is great for running, lifting, rafting, etc.  Unless you want to strap on a water resistant or bagged phone, the lack of range makes swimming with it impractical.  That said it's been a great headset for me.

Great, the short time it lasted


These were great....while they worked. I bought a pair and about 6 months later they just stopped working. I tried all the tricks they gave me but nothing. I figured it was a defective pair and the warranty covered getting a new pair. So the company sent me a new pair, super easy and quick. The second pair stopped working a lift over a year after I got them. Same problem- just stopped. I emailed the company, this time I was over a year so the warranty didn’t cover it. They were quick to respond, but only offered a 5% discount as consolation. I am choosing not to use the coupon code. I guess I shouldn’t expect products to last very long, then the company wouldn’t make any money.

Now, they have stopped working altogether.  On October 30, I began having problems with bluetooth connectivity.  They would pair with my iphone 6s plus and then immediately drop the connection.

very disappointed at these headphones. I gave it a chance, but I could not stand the fact that the Bluetooth connection keeps cutting in and out at the gym. I tried to do a process of trial and error to see what exactly is causing the interruptions.. it has to be the fact that there are too many other Bluetooth connections around. even at some points where I took my phone out and had it directly in front of my face it would cut in and out when there are others nearby and congested. returned for another pair hoping it was just a defect. nope. I would not recommend these headphones if  you're planning to work out with them in a crowded gym. the sound and bass is great and it's just a shame that the Bluetooth connectivity is horrendous.

Didn't make it through a dozen wearings


This product has two issues.  If your ears are underwater, there is no sound.  In water as long as your ears are not submerged, you can get sound.  As you go in and out of the water while swimming, it breaks up the sound.  I was willing to live with this problem because the product was very inexpensive.  After wearing the headphone about 12 to 15 times, it stopped staying charged.  I could charge it and get the blue light but it would immediately lose the charge upon unplugging it.  Note to self: buy a better quality earbud.

Best BT Headphones In Price Range


I am sure these would pale in comparison to some of the other offerings out there, but these are less than half the price of others. I had the highly regarded Anker sportbuds which were alright, but could always stick to the neck and pull out of the ears. The foam earplug material does a great job of dampening ambient outside nose (read: not noise cancelling) and helping seal the buds for a high fidelity sound. They are easy to work and their pairing works well. The over ear securement keeps the bud in place, even if it isn't in the ear completely, so you aren't wrestling it on a run or in the middle of a workout. If you want a good set of bluetooth buds that you aren't afraid of breakage or loss, these are worth the money, 100%

I just received by Senso Bluetooth headphones and didn't know what to expect based upon their relative low price, but I was pleasantly surprised because I have small ear canals and the small gel ear tips and the sound tube allowed me to get the perfect fit for my ears.  Pairing was easy with my iPhone 6 and the sound is very impressive.  I am not an audiophile but in my personal opinion it has good bass, treble and midrange.  You get a neat dual long power cord for micro-USB and lighting connector Apple devices along with a short USB power cord and 2 outlet cigarette charger all for the low price around $35 bucks with a one year warranty.  I bought these because I was going on vacation near swimming pools and the beach and these have an IPX 7 rating and will be perfect for my poolside lounging.

Sounds better than $200 PowerBeats


These headphones have incredible sound quality for the price tag that was recently reduced to half of what they sold for a year ago.  I have a $200 pair of PowerBeats and can’t stand their thin, treble sound compared to the Senso’s.  You do need to buy more than 1 pair because they are not long-lived.  I power walk 10 km a day in Thailand and combination of sweat and humidity breaks down the glue and they fall apart.  Superglue can extend the life but then the battery starts to go and when that happens, it takes multiple tries to connect up and then one day it doesn’t charge at all.  No worries, just grab your back pair for this price.  They recently changed the part that wraps around your ear from fixed plastic to a pliable rubber coated metal that you shape.  Horrible idea, now they don’t stay put and you loose the bass when they pop out.

Bluetooth isn't as reliable when phone isn't in direct path to the headphone


The left bud buzzez often times. Went on a bike ride, and Bluetooth connection is really bad. Had series of back to back breaks and drops with less than 2 feet away from my phone. It got really annoying and had to disconnect and use the phone speaker instead. Contacted seller, and I was told to reset the device by holding the power button for 7 seconds. It didn't help.

OKAY.. NOT BAD!


I have used this a whole month. It was okay. Sound quality is good just like the beats wireless. Feels and looks bulky in the ears. Charge only holds for almost 8-9 hours. Worst thing was pairing with my iPhone. It takes 5-10 min to pair I just have to keep trying which is very annoying thing to do when you gettin ready to workout. For the price it is okay. I ended up getting a beats wireless which I am very comfortable with now. If you want something basic to start this is a good affordable wireless pair. But there’s few cons like I mentioned earlier!

I wanted to like these so bad


I wanted to like these so bad. They seemed like such a great deal and I thought they'd be great to wear when I go for a walk.My #1 problem with these headphones is their poor connection with my phone. When connected, I cannot place my phone in my left pocket without the audio starting to cut out. Same if I hold the phone in my left hand. The connection is only stable in my right hand or right pocket. Don't know what that's about--I'm guessing the bluetooth antenna is in the right ear?--but it's incredibly annoying, and I'm seriously thinking about returning them for this reason alone. We're not talking about the phone being 30 feet away--it's literally three feet away, in my other pocket. Very frustrating. The earbuds are fully charged and it's not my phone, which connects to a bluetooth speaker in the kitchen just fine.Also the bass is tuned way, way too high on these out of the box. I *still* haven't gotten it turned back to normal. I hope you like 90% bass, because that's what you're getting.The earbuds do fit comfortably in my ears and get plenty loud enough. The accessories are nice. Pairing setup was easy and they pair instantly when powered on.

They fit on my ear good enough and came with different bud sizes for inside ...


I ordered these for my wife to go with her new Pixel and unfortunately the plastic part that wraps around your ear is giant and does not adjust. She wasn't able to keep them on her ears. For the price I figured I would try them out and she could get a different pair. They fit on my ear good enough and came with different bud sizes for inside your ear. They synced up to my S8 easily and sounded good when I turned them on with my phone in my hand. I got out of the car to play basketball and put the phone in my pocket and heard a scratchy noise like the bluetooth signal was weak. I started warming up with my phone in my hoodie pocket thinking it was a bit closer and may fix the issue but it did not. The connection was terrible. I had to take them out completely because they couldn't even make it through a full song with out cutting out. I have a pair of LG bluetooth headphones I have been using for years that have never had this problem so I know it isn't my phone. I was surprised with all of the high star reviews and appearance of quality manufacturing that the functionality of the ""Active"" earbuds really don't work while active. I just dropped them off at the post office for a return. The return process seems easy enough so far and they give you a full refund so it is worth a try- maybe I just got a bunk pair.

Wow!


Im just going to leave a quick review since there are so many reviews already.These headphones are more than worth the money. They have really good sound for the price. Buy them.Ive been using flat response earbuds for years so im not as big a fan of alot of bass as other people might be. That being said im much less a fan of very harsh high frequencies. These have a crisp and enjoyable high end. The low end and low mids were a little much for me. I find myself using an eq on my phone for most headphones anyway, and id much rather do a slight cut in the low end than have to do surgical eq in the highs and high mids.I did a 6-8 dB cut at 60hz and around 200 hz. I left the rest of the frequencies alone. After doing that i was very suprised with how it opened not only cleaned up the low mids but also cleaned up the overall clarity of these buds.That being said i cant suggest these enough for people. They are a little muddy but if you like more bass you can leave to lows alone and do a slight cut around 200 and you will not be disappointed. If you dont like using an eq, you really dont have to they sound fine without it.Thanks Senso! Dont understand why the big companies like sony cant seem to get this right on any of their bluetooth earbuds under 200 dollars. These buds sound better than all the non studio headphones i own. Even wired ones.Updated: i uploaded a picture of the eq settings of my specific set. This puts them pretty close to flat if anyone is interested.

They are also water resistant and i dont have to worry about sweating. With all this i bought a set for my wife and she liked them so much she made me order and ship a set to my son in another state.

Replacing my Beats by Dre earbuds


So, I had a pair of Beats by Dre bluetooth earbuds, 2nd series, that I lost and needed to replace (NEEDED.  i just can't deal with wired earbuds at the gym).  I ordered these because I really like the over-the-ear builds, and after testing them yesterday I'm pretty happy with the purchase.  I feel like the sound quality is really close, as is the quality of the hardware.  The only knock I would give these is that I like the button layout of Beats better, but it's certainly not enough to take off a star.  When I got my Beats, they were around $200.  Currently, you can get them for $100.  I got these for just over $30.  Do yourself a favor.  Unless that little 'b' on the side of your head is that important to you, score yourself a pair of these and go spend that extra $60 on something else.

Amazingly and over the top better quality


So ever since upgrading the cellphomenand now having a phone with no audio jack for corded headsets, I have been trying to find the best bluetooth options for myself. I bought a few that were more expensive(ex beats 3). These headphones are just as good , if not much better than the beats 3. When I first received them, I put them through a few of my own personal tests. Not one issue. They survived getting wet, prolonged use of music listening and phone conversations.My only issue is the 3 foot cord does not seem to fit the charging port. The mini charging cord is fine and will just get a two sided usb extender cord.

Fantastic


I have had these headphones for 2 days now and so far these are the best headphones I have ever had. Not to mention that the price was under $40....They sound as good as my Beats 2 Wireless earbuds !!! They were easy to pair with all of my devices, and have the BEST volume of any wireless earbuds I have ever owned (that's over least 10 pairs) You can actually keep the device volume at 50% and it is still loud !!!......So far they are very comfortable and fit and stay in your ear (but that is with limited use). I would highly recommend these if you are thinking about getting a great sounding pair of wireless headphones for a reasonable price.....

wont Charge after 90 days


041919-a couple weeks ago my wife left these on the charger for roughly a week. After she took them off the charger they would not turn back on. She left them alone to see if maybe they need reset or something. She also tried another charger as well. No dice. So now we have a set of ear phones that are worthless and are barely over the 90 day support.011519-I bought these for my wife while she runs and works out. They are great since I have used them once or twice when she is not looking. Only negative is battery life. You have to charge them almost after each use. Of course that means every 4 hours or so I believe.

Great all ways, and now the sound is great too.


These phones have all the features you could want, and they are very comfortable to wear. BUT they have awful sound. There are no highs, and lows are boomy and muddy. I listened to Béla Fleck, and you could not tell he was playing a banjo. They are fine for listening to old-time radio while exercising, but NOT for music. Very disappointing.----------------------I followed the manufacturer's suggestion and did a reset. Thats fixed the problem. But actually I think the lousy sound came from pushing the buds too far into my ears. I found out that as I put them in, the sound was better!. So, when inserted lightly, it is quite excellent. I think that the sound channel got pinched.

The best I've ever had.


This is my second Senso Bluetooth. Somehow I let my first pair slip off my neck. I found them 5 minutes later. A car had run over one side. I glued the casing back on and they still work but one side is a little lower. Now that is my extra pair I use on my laptop. So as you see I really like them. Great sound and comfort.Now a few months later the left side quit working. I even have them clipped on so they won't come off again. But this problem. I still want another pair but I will see if seller has any type of warranty on them. But they are great when they were working.

Not worth it


They stay in just fine while jogging or lifting weights. However, the hooks don't hold the earbuds in, the actual earbuds hold themselves in. I doubt they'll stay in for everyone because I the size of peoples' ears are different. They also hurt after about a half hour or so of listening.I'd be fine with all this, but for the fact that the sound cuts out if there is too much movement (such as jogging). What's the point of getting these to work out with if they cut out with movement? I definitely do not recommend, and am in the process of returning them. I give two stars because, if you stay still enough, they don't sound bad.

They do not fit my ears


I had high hopes but sadly the ear phones  did not fit as I had hoped. I have kind of average sized ears, maybe a little on the small side. I do not like things inside my ears because of an ear wax issue that i have. I read some reviews and the different sizes of ear thingies made me hopeful. I'm an athlete and I run as much as I can. I needed ear buds that don't fall out while I'm running. These ear phones did not pass the test. The rubber parts that go around my ears are too soft plus they don't even touch my ears where they are supposed to to keep them on my ears. I literally had to stop running often to push and try and twist the buds far enough into my ears to make them stay for another few feet of my run before I had to stop and do it again. The sound is good if I can get them to stay but since they don't, the sound becomes like in a tin can as they say.

Five star for the product and definitely more than 5 star for the customer service.

Disappointed


I really wanted to like these, with almost 20,000 reviews they have to be good. These hurt my ears after 5 minutes. The disc-shaped plastic that the earbuds attach to rub against my ears and press against the cartilage constantly. When I press the red button to answer a call it presses the earpiece into my ear even more and really hurts. The sound was okay, nothing spectacular. And I have to pay $7 to return these through UPS even though they're a prime product?

Long battery life


I use these to listen to podcasts or books on tape, so I can't weigh in on sound quality.  What I can say is that these pair quickly every time, the battery life is pretty good vs others that I've tried, and the ear pieces really go into your ear canal - I'm not sure the over ear thingies are even necessary.  I've had no issues with the waterproofness, but have only worn them around the house and in the hot tub (not underwater or in a rainstorm).  Price was right and I have no complaints.

Good/Not Great.  Worth it if you don't use for listening to music.


These are good.  I wish they had louder sound, more bass and treble.I like the small round travel case it arrived in.  The audio level isn't excellent (not like Bose or higher end) or what I'm accustomed to, but if you're buying these for non-music-listening-purposes, they're great.I had difficulty getting these to stay in my ear, but that could be for many reasons.  I prefer ear cup headphones however needed smaller workout earbuds, so bought these.  They're ok.  Mom was right ""You get what you pay for"".

The sound quality is pretty good, not great


Update: They made it almost a year. I got them in January of 2017 and now one side has all but totally died. I am a bit sad. These have been the best set of ear buds that I have had, corded or BT.The sound quality is pretty good, not great, but well worth $30. The battery life is just about as good as advertised at about 6 to 7 hours. I use these for working out and doing cardio and they stay in my ears and have never been even remotely uncomfortable. Also, they do a very good job of blocking outside sounds. I like these earbuds a lot. They are my go to even though I have several other pairs.

better than powerbeats


I recently purchased the SENSO Bluetooth headphones after my $200 dollar power beats broke and the company would not replace them. I use these headphones on a constant basis and after a week of use I am more happy with these than my power beets and wish I would have bought these first, would have saved myself a lot of money. If you want to buy a low cost great pair of headphones I suggest buying these and I have been telling all my friends at the gym that they needed these.Thank you SENSO for putting out a low cost great pair of headphones in a world of highly expensive products that make you have to refinance your home too afford.

Good sound, comfortable, but they don't last.


I bought my first pair and I loved them. The sound is good and they were comfortable. After about 6 months  someone at my gym apparently wanted them more and took them. So I bought another set. After 3 months they turned off randomly and I would have to power them back on. In a couple of weeks time they stopped working all together. So, I bought my 3rd pair thinking sometimes things happen and you just get a lame duck. I've had them about a month and they just quit working out of nowhere. It's too bad because they do sound good and they are comfortable, but I don't think that I will take a chance on these again.

Worth the Money


Since there are a lot of brands that are priced much higher, I didn't want to write before I give myself enough time to experience the quality of the sound. To my good surprise I found that the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones provide a high quality stereo sound that is both deep and without any static. The battery life is as long as 8 hours or a little more. The material is good and the box contains various sizes of ear buds. I think it competes very well with other higher-priced Bluetooth Headphones.

Ok for the price, but they keep falling out


I bought these for working out, so I don't need top of the line sound quality. These are ok... the bass is muddy sometimes, and they seem to be heavier on the higher frequencies, but they're not bad at all for $30 headphones. My biggest issue is that they keep falling out of my ears. The loop that keeps them in your ears is adjustable, but no matter what I try, they start coming loose after a few minutes of running. I've tried practically curling the loop part completely around my ear, and after a few minutes, they're loose again. Very annoying. My old headphones just had a rubber loop that wasn't adjustable, and they stayed in just fine, so even though it seems like the ability to adjust them should make them even better, I just can't get them to stay in.

These make my workouts better!


These are my first pair of wireless headphones and I'm pretty impressed! I have worked out in them 3 times and they sound great, they don't get destroyed by my sweat, and they stay in place.  Like other reviewers have said if you're used to $200 beats then these might not be for you but for me, they are perfect.  At 30 bucks they are definitely worth it!Love how the battery level shows up on my phone and I can adjust the volume on the ear piece.  Only thing it doesn't do is allow me to change songs which isn't a big deal.Give these a try!

Great value and customer support.


UPDATE 2: The replacement pair came in the mail and I have been using them for about a week.  So far I am noticing a marked improvement over my original pair with respect to reception.  Bad reception still occurs occasionally, though seemingly only when I have the transmitter (my phone) deep in my jeans pocket + I am walking + I put something else in the same pocket over/next to the phone (like my hand or wallet for example).  Other than that very specific situation, reception has been much improved.  I can even leave my phone on the counter in one room and still get reception in an adjacent room.  I am upgrading to 4.5 stars, but I will round that up to 5 stars because I'm such a nice guy (and Amazon doesn't allow half stars).UPDATE: Customer service responded almost immediately regarding my email customer service request.  They suggested a few things to try and when those didn't work they asked for my address to send me a replacement.  Customer service has been excellent so far.  I will update my review upon receiving and testing the replacement pair.I got these about 2 months prior to posting this review and as of this afternoon they are dead.  A few days ago sound in the left ear started cutting out.  Now the set won't even turn on.  I will contact SENSO about this.  Hopefully they replace them or refund me or something.  In the meantime, please see my review below regarding the headphones before they broke completely.Pros:Decent sound quality for the price.  A little heavy on the base for podcasts (spoken word sounds a bit ""muddy""), but they sounded pretty good for music.Good battery life (I rarely had to charge more than once every couple days despite using 2-5 hours per day).Comfortable and stayed on my ears.Easy to use (intuitive and simple buttons and an easy to access charging port)Packaging, accessories, and build quality all appear and feel excellent (like that of higher end headphones.)Cons:Bluetooth reception was inconsistent.  At times the reception would work fine, at other times I would need to take the phone out of my shirt pocket and hold it near my right earbud just to make sure the reception wouldn't cut out.  As you can imagine, it's pretty annoying to have to take your phone out of your cotton shirt pocket and hold it directly next to your earbud just to avoid cut out.  All I want to do is walk around and listen to my headphones without cutout!!!!The headset gives a warning when the battery is low by having a voice say ""battery low"" in your ear.  It seems helpful, but the voice interrupts whatever you are listening to every 1 or 2 minutes to remind you that your battery is low.  I'd rather just listen until the battery is dead without that irritating and unnecessary reminder.  Not a deal breaker though as you can just stop listening once you hear the first warning and consider the battery dead.  You would only be able to squeeze another 5-10 minutes of listening from the headset once the warnings start anyways.The charging light shines through a little pinhole that you can't really see unless you are staring at it from the correct angle.  Not a big deal, but it is annoying to have to right up to the headphones in order to tell if they are finished charging.  I would have preferred a light visible from further away.Conclusion:Given all the positive reviews and the quality look and feel of the headset, I'm guessing I may have been unlucky and received a defective pair.  Hopefully SENSO's customer service is good and I can try another pair before calling it quits on this brand.

SOME PROS and CONS


Some pros and cons with this item.  I bought these headphones because I like to run 5-8 miles several times a week and workout at the gym.  I was tired of dealing with the headphone cable getting tangled in machines at the gym, and having to hold my phone while I ran.  Here's the PROS:, the headphones are GREAT for the gym and they are great for doing hands free stuff like talking on the phone while folding laundry or driving, I could not be happier with their performance, they sound great, and are easy to use.  CONS::: The earbuds do not stay in very well while I run, which is SUPER frustrating, I will note that the right side ear bud stays in fine, so I don't know if this is defect of the product I received or a problem with my ear or what, but either way, its not good for doing anything like running, basketball, crossfit, anything with a lot of movement.  THAT BEING SAID: I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN. If this were at $100+ item, I would not be happy with the item, but as cheap as this is, I LOVE them for the gym and driving and such and plan on buying another pair as a gift for a friend.******* UPDATE ******** 5/21It's been a little over a month since I've purchased these headphones.  I am not pleased with this product.  The headphones now lose blue tooth connectivity with almost every use, this is despite my phone either being in my pocket or on an arm band.  Pretty disappointing, I guess you get what you pay for, they worked OK for a few weeks, but they are as good as trash now, I 'm glad I didn't throw out my old wire headphones.

I was initially very happy with the headphones


I was initially very happy with the headphones.  It has been about two weeks and now I seem to be having more issues with transmission/connection between my phone and the headphones - i.e. songs skipping, video transmission of sound lags behind what characters/actors are actually saying.  I am going to give them more time but it seems like the longevity of these headphones just is not there.  May have to consider spending the crazy amount of money for the higher end wireless headphones :(The sound quality and quick pairing have been great to this point however.

I can't say enough about this product. The quality is great at a fraction of the price of the competitors. It's clear for both music and phone calls and is extremely comfortable when working out. In addition, their customer service is amazing! I had a problem with a set and at first they gave me a solution (and responded immediately), which worked for a while, but then the issue came back. They immediately sent me out a completely new one, no questions asked, no shipping charge, no requirement to send the old one back. Can't ask for more than that!

Great Sound, Very Loud, Great Bass, Poor Microphone Quality


These headphones are amazing! If you are looking for a great pair of bluetooth headphones to listen to music with look no further. As far as talking on the phone, these are terrible. No one can hear you at all. I'm assuming because the mic is poorly place on the inner part of the headphone. So if you are looking for a good quality bluetooth to using the telephone this is not for you. I mainly use these while working out or at work and the sound quality is amazing. The BASS is really really good, I was very surprised at how well these sounded. I would have given these 5 stars, but because of the poor microphone quality I'm giving it a 4. I personally did not mind, but whenever I did want to use the bluetooth to talk it was just super annoying because I would constantly have to scream at the person on the other end or just turn the bluetooh off all together and talk using the phone.

Not a good buy if you plan to use this headphone daily


Overall Not happy about this product. I always read reviews about products before making a purchase, which is what I did before deciding on this headphone. I was impressed after reading and checking out a few videos on this model. Surprised to find that this headset failed in operation less than a year of use. Wont hold a charge. Connects to phone only to abruptly power off after a few minutes. Tried charging them again to find the blue light which indicates full charge, but again results in repeated abrupt shutdowns. Needless to say this was either a faulty item or this headset is not a viable option for someone who plans to use this headphones on a regular basis.

Just Terrible


I bought these because so many people have had great luck with them. The packaging is awesome, they look and feel well made and they give you some great accessories, but the headphones sucked for me. The bluetooth connection is absolutely terrible. Some days they work better than others. Most days I have to keep my iPhone in my pocket for them to stay connected. If I left my phone by my workout bench they would start disconnecting and skipping if I walked a few feet away to grab a weight. If I leave my phone on the gym floor to do pull-ups, they will skip at the top of the pull-up..... These are seriously HORRIBLE and the sound quality is something that you would find in $5 gas station headphones.

Everything I hope they would be and more!


Everything I hoped they would be and more! The sound is outstanding, and I listen to a lot of songs with Bass so I was hoping that these headphones would live up to the positive reviews that I read on these, and they definitely exceeded my expectations. These wireless headphones are my FIRST EVER pair that I have ever owned and I wanted to get a pair with truly good sound quality as well as a good price and these were an amazing buy for me because I wanted to make sure I could hear all the background instruments as well as a good fit. I have very small ears and normally regular headphones always seem to fall out, but these fit my little bitty ears like a glove! So happy with not only the product, but the extra's that came along with it including the dual carport charger, the extra pairs of ear plugs, the awesome case, etc. If you are looking to buy a pair of outstanding quality wireless headphones at an AWESOME price THESE Bluetooth headphones are a MUST. Now I understand why they are backed up as an Amazon recommended purchase. I have only had them for about a week, but I am extremely pleased with them and glad they accommodate to my music loving experience :)

Returning right away!!!


Save your money and buy something else! First, they arrived without the 3rd set of ear inserts, second they were missing the wire tie, third the battery showed it was near full when received and dropped to almost zero after 15 mins of use. Fourth, they sound absolutely horrible, sure there is bass but at even a quarter volume they sound like the mids and highs are blowen. I've bought Bluetooth headphones in this price point before from TaoTronics and was blown away by their sound and quality, unfortunately they broke after 6 months and possibly someone stepping on them! Finally, the fit is not good...the over the ear part is almost worthless for me and I have average sized ears.

Dead after 2 months


I've used these a few times a week since early January. I bought them because it's nice to be able to do strength training workouts while listening to music and not having to deal with wires. They worked great, sound quality was excellent. I had to charge them after every 2-3 workouts, but that's more or less what I expected. Now, they won't turn on, won't charge, won't reset. They're completely dead. These are obviously inexpensive but I did expect to get more than 6-7 weeks with them. Really disappointing.

Frustrating to Use, Cheaply Made and Poor Quality/ High, Shrill Sound


Ordered them in December, 2018. I finally had the opportunity to try the headphones. It was my first and extremely frustrating experience using a Bluetooth Device. They are muffled when applying pressure to them (to fit them in the ear properly). They are very high tone, when no pressure is applied. (Pushing them in, assists in a truer, but, poor tone.) I would prefer to return them for a better quality sounding headset, or, receive a refund. It took me over an hour to figure out how to get them to work. After doing so, it was nothing more than a disappointment. All the ear cushions are the same size (exception of one pair) None of them fit in the ear canal properly and they are all very difficult to switch on and off the headset. The power button easily turns off/ on while adjusting the ear piece. All 3 of my dollar store wired ear buds have a much nicer fit and sound quality. Would be nice to find a nice pair of wireless headphones with a healthy quality sound. I am not satisfied with these at all.

It takes about a minute for the earphones to connect to my device. While the connection is being made, it will give very scratchy, disconnected sound while my music is trying to play.The first six months were awesome, but for the low price point, i guess i cant expect a long-use  quality product..

Stopped working within a few weeks


I've had these headphones for a few weeks, and they simply died on me. Not sure what happened. It could be that I received a defective pair, but now they won't charge or turn on.Defectiveness aside, I experienced a lot of the same negatives that other reviewers of these have: the headphones disconnect from blue tooth quite often, and virtually no noise cancellation. Additionally, the power button for these headphones is really sensitive, and if you throw them in a purse or a pocket to bring with you somewhere, oftentimes they will turn on of their own accord, and then run out of battery life when you need to pull them out to use them. Very disappointing.

Excellent value for these buds


The value for the dollar is huge on these buds. I needed something that would stay in my ears while being active and these delivered, once I found the ear tips that fit (I used the foam ones that came with it). I do wish that they would allow for the Comply tips to fit, but the connection is too small. Sound is good and they're comfortable to wear for hours. Minimal Bluetooth issues - occasionally a hiccup but that's normal for these devices. You get a ton of goodies in the box, including a cool two-headed charging cable, which will save space in the glove box of the car. Just two wishes for me: they feel a little cheap, so perhaps a better plastic (I'm coming from a set of Jaybird Bluebuds), and it would be good to have extra foam ear pieces (I typically need to replace them every six months). Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.

I was so excited to find a pair of headphones that actually fit and stayed on my ears. I have very small ear canals and most headphones are way too large and fall out constantly. These thankfully had attachments small enough that they could fit as well as having the extra security of the wraparound piece, which I loved. Unfortunately, the bluetooth keeps randomly disconnecting from my phone. It's very frustrating to have to keep pressing play on my phone or having to turn off and repair the bluetooth connection. Huge bummer.

Sigh


I thought this one would be better than the previous ones I purchased but it is basically the same. The quality is substandard and sound quality is nothing to write home about. I gave it to my daughter because I am fed up

Very comfortable with excellent sound.


I purchased these on the off-chance that they would be comfortable and I wasn't disappointed! Regular ear buds hurt my ears and as a glasses wearer the headphones that sit on the ears put pressure on the earpieces behind the ear and cause pain so I've to resort to ear-muff type headphones. I hardly know that I'm even wearing these and the silicone earpieces are amazingly comfortable. The sound is also amazing! I can now hear pieces of the song that I've never heard before. Everthing including the carry case and charger cable are quality. I won't hesitate to recommend this set to anyone. Good job Senso!

Great for the price!


These are great. Only 4 starts because once in a while mine drop out (lose connection) and you have to do a hard reset, which is easy and only takes a minute. I like them for the price. Bought my wife a pair. She loves them. They don’t compare to high end headphones, but at this price, that’s not a surprise. Have had them for about 4 months. Wear mine to the gym 3-5 times a week. I also like functionality, when you turn on, the audio cue in headphones tells you they are on, then connected or disconnected.

cost efficient, loud, holds charge for a full work day. buds dont fall out.


Good headphones, slightly uncomfortable at first. Stays in ear without that half loop around your ear, bud can hold in place. buds dont fall off. volume is louder then normal which i like. Voice is a bit weird, but music has decent bass. plus they included alot of cables, extra buds, car usb, and case.Doing strength lifts and oly lifts used to shake wireless headphones off my head, wires get pulled from barbell, but these headphones stay in place for squats, full cleans, OHP. easy to put wire in front of you for squats and behind you for cleans and presses. would buy again! Also buds dont fall off and get lost like my wireless samsungs lvl U

Great headphones, but be careful where your phone is


Sometimes, depending on what material my shorts/pants are made out of, I can't put my phone in my left pocket without the signal cutting in and out. The signal originates from the right ear bud and the body and pants material sometimes block the signal. This was the reason I returned a different brand, but in this case it's not too terrible so I'll keep it.I love the presentation and delivery. There is so much to be had by going with this brand, the ear buds, charging cable, carrying case, etc. I felt like I received a great value. They're also extremely comfortable and easier than expected to put in. Sound quality and volume are great.I would make this 4.8 stars if I could, because the audio range isn't really that bad, but still a little ""ehhh...""

Died 1 year and 7 months after purchase


These were THE BEST HEADPHONES EVER... until one day they just died. Like, they just don't turn on anymore. When I plug them in, I see the blue light which means they are fully charged. When I disconnect it from the powercord, then they won't actually turn on. When I contacted Senso Support I received the following message:""Actually, due to the inherent nature of electronic products, sometimes there are instances when some products turn out defective after some use. Unfortunately, our warranty department tried to process a replacement for you but our system rejected it as the warranty of your headphones has been expired. The warranty started on the initial date of purchase and is no longer valid.""So if you do purchase them, my recommendation is to use the warranty before your 1 year runs out, just IN CASE they decide to die on you and then you are left with nothing.

Glad to see customer service is still around.


Purchased a pair for my wife on her birthday. I received them on time. They worked great for two days. Then I had some problems with the pairing to Bluetooth device. I contacted SENSO and explained my problem through email exchanges. They were very helpful in directing me to try several troubleshooting steps. That did not work. After 5 email exchanges they agreed that I had a faulty pair and sent me a replacement according to the warranty. I just received the replacements and I am very hopeful that I can enjoy many years of good music. The sound quality is good. I like them and will purchase another pair for myself if the replacement ones do better than the original pair.

Can't fit into my ear


If I put the earloop over my ear, the earbud part doesn't fit into my ear canal and rests outside of it.  I'm using the smallest tips, but it seems the angle of the hook relative to the angle of the earbud portion are not correct for my ear.  If the hook could be positioned in different positions I could probably make them work, but since the point of these is the earhook I'm only giving these 3 stars.  The earhook holds them in place, but the sound isolation is poor due to them not going into my ear.

Great value, Bose quality is still better


I have to admit, I am very impressed at the first opening of the package. I have been using the wired Bose soundsport earbuds for workouts. My frustration with the wires finally led me looking into wireless earbuds. I did not want to spend $150 on the newer wireless bose soundsport earbuds. I decided to give these a chance based on the reviews. It has full functionality and I am very impressed.I do not think the sound quality is on the Bose level, but it is still very impressive for the price. Very good value and worth the purchase. I am hoping these will stay in for a sweaty workout, otherwise I will be returning.

As good as it gets.  Sadly.


First, the good stuff: These are packaged beautifully, and they come in a very nice carry case with plenty of necessary accessories.  The quality of manufacture is excellent.  On these points alone they should get five stars.  The instructions were clear and well-written.  Everything about these headphones is top quality, except.....The sound quality.  I am not sure I should lay this on Senso, though, because this is my third set of Bluetooth headphones. I decided to spend more, do some market research, and select the best quality I could get. I probably DID get the best quality I could get. But the sound quality is just nowhere near what I want it to be, either on receiving (fair) or transmitting (poor). People I talk with on the phone say I sound like I'm in a tunnel, no matter what the environment. But that seems to be the way it is with these things. I just don't think you can get a set of Bluetooth headphones like this that have good, let alone great, sound quality.No offense, Senso, you make a great set of headphones in every respect that you can control. I just think I will never find a set that gives good (let alone great) quality sound, especially on transmitting. I believe if you are buying these to listen to music while you run or workout, you will likely be very satisfied. I bought them for hands-free conversations, and I am going to abandon them after two days of use.  Three stars, because that's all Bluetooth headphones will ever deserve, even the best-made sets like this Senso.

Battery doesnt last long..


I bought these earbuds to be something cheap use while running and sweating. While they look in your ears and stay in place pretty well they sound pretty good and they've held up to sweat after about five months of using two or three times a week my battery no longer holds a charge when I turn them on they say they're at 80% 20 minutes later they're dead and won't stay paired to my phone not too bad for the price I guess but I'm going to keep looking for something better

Great use for talking


I had these for over a month before I decided to write this review. The sounds are clear and definitely bass. Great use for talking, and listening to music. Where it didn't sound great was using it for gaming like Player Unknown's Battleground. Where tiny footsteps and directional sound are key factors. With that said, these are great wireless headphones. Yes get them for this price its a steal.I've had the lg wireless headphones prices ranging from $60-$199 several sets and I'm greatly impressed by these headphones there clarity is on par with the expensive brands. I've even accidentally stepped on these a couple of times and they didn't break.

Not good in wind.


The headphones are comfortable and the sound is fine, but the problem I had with these was that if there is any wind in your face,  a ""wind roar"" is produced that is very loud and drowns out the music. Not even a super wind. It has been sunny and in the 70's, so I would call it a pleasant breeze.  I'm walking with these headphones, not cycling or jogging which I would imagine will just intensify the disturbance. Prior to this I had Motorola flex and didn't have the same issue so, for me, this is a deal breaker and I am sending them back.

Falls off my ears, good quality, noise cancellation


The sound quality is perfect as well as noise cancellation. Battery life is on average also. The only concern when using this product is depending on size of ears. Smaller ears have a hard time fixing it. Because of the design of the product itself, it makes it harder to enjoy the music since it usually falls off my ears.

Awesomely Loud


Very loud. If you are into the heavy metal during your workout, these are the units for you. Pantera and White Zombie never sounded better. I love how these things set perfect depth in your ear. I had some other types that are too far in, too far out, can't get them angled just right. These are in your ear almost foolproof.  That is the best feature of these for workout ear buds. Not constantly having to adjust them.Minor weakness is the max Bluetooth range. My old JBL would range out a little further....but the JBL sucked compared to these for the reasons I listed.

Really poor sound quality


Really poor sound quality. I mean really poor; its like someone took your perfect EQ settings in your app and pushed everything back to the middle. Really flat mids and highs, strong bass, but who cares if the rest of the sound quality is terrible?Only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because it works. I even accidentally ran it through the wash machine and its still working. Once I started using this to watch youtube videos on my tablet without disrupting everyone else, I forgave it for its sound quality (i.e., not using it for music).

Great sound, comfort, looks, and battery play-time for the money


These arrived in fast time.  Everything was neatly packaged and it came with all the hardware, and few extras that I liked.  The instruction were easy to follow and the bluetooth easily connect to my android phone...as it they belonged there.  They are very light and comfortable to wear and the line comes with an adjustable wire tie that works well.  I took a chance with these to replace my expensive Jabra Sport blurtooth earbuds, which the battery life gave out after 14 months of use.  As a marathon runner, I need my battery life to last at least 5 hours at minimum and sound halfway decent.  These were rated at around 8 hours play time.  For the price of $29, I felt I may take a hit on sound quality and general quality...I was wrong.  Surprisingly, to me, these sound as equal to my expensive Jabras' and present with decent quality and in looks.  The only negative (is why I gave four instead of five stars) is the bluetooth signal. It rates at 30 feet.  However, I've tested these in non-obstructive pathways outside and indoors at the gym. I averaged out at 10 feet in all areas before gaining signal static and play pauses.  And if you wear a water resistant phone arm sleeve, I noticed the sleeve can obstruct the signal intermittently.  Not a big deal for me, I worked it out by turning the phone in an opposite position.  These earbuds aren't the high-end of the market, but for the price, these give some of the more expensive ones a good challenge,  They do very well in comfort and sound for me, and hoping they live up to the ""Almost 8-hour battery play time"" as stated.  I'll addendum this review on the battery play time.

Fourth pair


Lost first two pairs, but happy with them, so replaced them with same. Unfortunately, both new pairs have bent wiring that never relaxes and is permanently kinked in a weird placement that pulls one side of the earphones away from the other ear. Also, neither pairs are as comfortable in the ear this go-round. It's not about the size of the bud, but more its shape, it seems, compared to the original pairs.

Great Value


These are a great value for  Bluetooth Headphones. They are light, easy to use. Complete integration with my Android based Samsung phone. I did have a minor issue with sound fidelity at first, but I remembered my phone has funky (and high quality) audio settings. So if you buy these and the sound quality is poor initially dig into your phones audio settings and try the multiple ear buds that come with this product until you find the best match for you. I was on the verge of returning these until I fixed the audio output setting on my phone and switched to the foam ear buds. NOW, You can't get these off my head except to charge.Could not be happier with the comfort level and sound quality for the money.

Do I enjoy suddenly hearing a unrelated voice out of know where at full volume scaring the sh!t out of you?NoDo I like picking up your headphones and finding I can't comfortable put them in my ears because for the millionth time the rubber part fell out?No. (Although they do throw in extras, its still very annoying and the extras aren't always conveniently near by.)Otherwise its a solid product. I hope have a firmware update to fix the jump scare robot voice to say ""battery low"" at the volume the user is currently using. If they did I would increase the rating.

Fabulous product from a manufacturer I had never heard of.  If you're looking for Bluetooth stereo ear buds your quest has ended.  Delivered exactly on time with all accessories including a case.  Incredible high fidelity base, treble, midrange clear sound and volume that you'll never turn up more than a quarter of the way.  Every function works exactly as you would expect it to with clear well written instructions.  Pairing is essentially instant. Very comfortable to use, and they don't fall off.  You'll forget you have them on.  All aspects of these ear buds are top quality with careful attention to construction, assembly and electronics.  I would give this terrific product six stars if I could.  The sound and performance of these $30 ear buds is as good or better than any big name $200 set.

Great HD sound quality, but loose on ears


These headphones are fantastic (but has its down side)! Great sound quality, definitely hear nothing but the music coming through. Great bass for how cheap these are. So far the only problem I can find are the hooks that are ""supposed"" to keep the headphone from falling. I read that this might be a problem when running, in the comments. However, i have yet to try them out while working out. They are definitely loose on the ears and no way to adjust. Everything else I give a 10/10 so far. When I see that the hooks become adjustable, i will rebuy and rate 5 stars.

After almost a year, they are still going strong.


I found these Bluetooth headphones to be some of the best I have ever gotten. They are a bit heavy on the base / lows right out of the box but over time this normalized out. When other headphones will go completely tinny in a few months these maintain good audio quality for a longer period of time and continue to do so.My only gripe is it seems to announce ""low battery"" over and over again once the device reaches 20% or less which seems to be a bit too early of a voice over warning. Especially when you hear how intrusive the warming voice over is.

Shortage issue with cord.


I gave these headphones a three star rating because from the moment I received them there seem to be a shortage.  I have to keep moving the cord. Around before it starts playing.  Once it starts working the sound is awsome.  In fact, had it not been for the shortage problem I would have given five stars. Theses are my second purchase of Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  I purchased one last year in May.  After a few months I got the same shortage issue.  I purchased a new set this year because I love the sound.  Will not be purchasing again.

Benefit of doubt


For the price I would say this bluetooth earphone is worth it. I used bose non-wireless earphone before and obviously the sound quality for that one was a lot better but the price would have been totally different if I bought a wireless version. The music sounds like I'm listening to a song I played with my iphone in another room which is probably because of the background noise (edit: I tried it again and now there's no bg noise it sounds amazing! @.@ maybe there're some inconsistencies in quality I'll update after several days). However, I've never owned any other bluetooth earphone so I'll give it a benefit of doubt since my iphone earphone jack is broken so this is a special case... Also, I would have complained about the car charger thing if I needed it because there were some obvious scratches on the silver part that made it lose its shine but I dont even own a car so whatever. The earbuds were comfortable to wear so that's a plus. The small bag and different earbud sizes were cool.

I work overnight maintenace and needed something wireless so i could get thru the night, so far these are pretty awesome. The sound is clear, the bass hits better than most wired headphones in the same price range. So far after one night of use, they lasted just over 8 hours of none stop playing, Not sure how much longer they would of lasted off a single charge.They are comfortable, the 'softness' of the ear hooks doesnt seem to be a problem, If i had to list a negative? I would say the wire is a little to short, But its my first time with this style of buds and might just need to ajust.

This pair of head phones cannot get an better for the price.Battery life: ~8 HoursCharge time: Less than 2 hours (I use a portable charger)Sound Quality: these headphones are extremely heavy on the bass, and weak on the treble. I own four audiophile quality headphones, in ear and over ear - after doing some serious EQ modifications this sounds like it's 75$. I've posted my EQ settings in case anyone is interested.Comfort: I use these in the gym and works perfectly, I would prefer these over my over ear Momentums on a hot day where I may get sweaty.

Works perfectly


Fits snugly around the ear and they don't have the feeling that they'll pop out with a sneeze like with buds.They don't cancel noise, but that's good if you're running on the beach or anywhere else you need to pay a modicum of attention to your surroundings.They'll last half the day non-stop, which is good enough.

Good sound and great customer service


Headphones sound great. I have had two pairs so far and highly recommmend this brand. I stepped on the first ones, then ordered a second pair because I liked them so much. By the way, I have tried 6 or 7 different brands of similar headphones and returned them all.The second pair of Sensos worked great for eight months, but they started cutting out a few weeks ago. I use them daily though and am pretty rough on them. So I wasn’t really upset or disappointed then they started acting crazy. I contacted customer service and they responded right away to troubleshoot the issue. Couldn’t resolve the problem, so they quickly sent out another pair. Hard to beat these headphones, at this price point, with the included 1 year warranty and great customer service.

Good looking and great sounding Bluetooth headphones


These are the third pair of bluetooth headphones I've purchased in the last 6 months and found these to be a winner. I had trouble with the previous two pair staying in my ears and was continually adjusting them. I have worked out several times with these and find they require little or no adjustment as I go through my workout. I haven't run with them but walking, using an elliptical and stationary biking have all been great. I find the sound quality much better than my Apple EarPods. The are easy to pair, adjust volume and change tracks as I listen to my iPhone or iPod. They are very light, and in my opinion, look great. The headphones also come with several goodies. They include a 2 port car charger and a USB - lightning/mini cable.

The sound is great for the price and they come in a really convenient little case with two charging chords.When I first received them, I was concerned bc the 3 ft long cable looked like it only had a lightning chord adapter and wouldn't plug in to charge the headphones. I was debating on returning them when I got an email from the company to let them know how I liked the product. I told them my concern, and they responded right away with a video showing that the chord actually flips out to display both the lightning adapter as well as a second adapter to charge the headphones, both on the same chord. I was pleasantly surprised and happy that I could keep the product.If you're looking for a good product both design wise and sound quality wise and don't want to spend one million dollars, these are great.

Great value


This is a much better quality set of headphones than I expected for the price.  Even the packaging was good quality.  These charged quickly ,paired easily,and sound fantastic.  The little extras that came in the box was a magnetic dash mount to hang your headphones on. A nice little cellphone wallet.  Attaches to back of cell phone to keep an I’d or credit card and a very nice sturdy carrying case.  I now can only hope that the headphones are as durable as I think they will be

Sleek design but this product needs some work. I bought these for an upcoming 1/2 marathon and I was disappointed.I ran with phone in my armband and connection was lousy. I spent the entire race trying to improve sound quality as it appeared shaky at best. For the comfortable design, it allows a lot of background noise in. I could constantly hear the wind blowing in ear piece. I ended up holing my phone in my hand the remainder of the race as this seemed to help audio quality. My co-worker has same pair and complains about same issues. I will not recommend or buy again. Wishing for a refund...

Good headset but mine didn't hold up to sweat..


For the price, these are great set of headphones. I bought my set in May of 2017 and ended up buying my boyfriend a set in September 2017 since he kept stealing mine. They fit comfortably and securely while running. They felt sturdy and the sound quality was good.Here's the downside: they didn't last. They don't hold up to sweat and moisture like they say they do. Had to retire mine this weekend (Jan 2018) this was after a slow decline in the sound volume to the point where treadmill noise drown out the music/tv show I was listening to. I run every other day so I may have expected too much out of these but I really liked them.Also, the power button on the side of my boyfriend's set is now sticking. He is going to see if the button of mine can be used to salvage his.I replaced them with a cheaper set which I hated but will use as a back up However, I inevitably broke down and bought the Bose SoundSports.

Great value, probably under-priced.


In terms of value for the price, this product is great.  However, these are the first bluetooth buds I've purchased and have quickly discovered that, when jogging, I have to have my phone on my right side and preferably within two feet or so of the right bud (which houses the bluetooth receiver), or else the sound cuts in and out a lot.  My new understanding is that this issue is common to all bluetooth buds.  This is only when I'm jogging.  Other than this one point, the sound is great (deep, robust sound).  My daughter also has a pair for use at the gym, and she loves them.

The best wireless headsets? Not even close.


The best wireless headsets? Not even close. The product is and does as advertised. The out of box experience is first rate. I wear this item when I am working out in the gym. The earbuds are big, heavy and the ear holder thingies wrap around the front of the ear, not the back. As a result, the ear buds are not very secure or snug. The ear buds do not fall out but I find myself constantly pushing them closer to my ear. Some would say that's a good thing. Personally, I like to corkscrew the ear buds in to my noggin' and these just don not allow me to do that.

They work well, but not comfortable


Pro: The price on these is great. They work well for both listening to music and phone conversations. Pairing with the first service is quite easy.Con: These aren't very comfortable. The part that you put in your ear is quite large and hard. Additionally, while pairing the first service was easy, the second device want so easy. If the first service is in range, I can't get it to go into pairing mode. I had to turn off Bluetooth on the first service while I paired to the second device. After both were paired, I could turn on both and both worked as expected.

Fine device, but not for my ears.


Sound was good. Materials felt ok. 👌🏻1. Main thing I did not like was the feeling of them around or in my ear. I feel it is mostly just the shape of my earI. I tried all the different ear adapters and none of them felt secure. It just felt like they were going to fall off my ears. The cord that connected them did not feel secure when it draped around the back of my neck. It slightly tugged at the earpieces.2. The Bluetooth connectivity is not great. If I am playing music, I can stop the music with the multifunction button and restart music if it’s nearly immediately after I stopped it, but if the music is stopped for greater than 5 seconds the music will not restart and I have to take my phone out of my pocket and push play again on my phone. Optimally it should just stay in audio mode and start and stop the music where you left off unless it was a phone call that interrupted the music. Software issue.3. When running, the bounce of the cord connecting the earpieces make a transmitted sound ‘thud’ with each step.I’ll continue to use my corded earbuds that feel secure in my ears while I run.Thanks for the ease of the return though.

We hit a home run with these!


This is the fifth brand of bluetooth headphones my husband has tried, and he LOVES these!  We hit the nail on the head, and I am so happy to have found them on Amazon- and for a wonderful price!  We hit a one day sale and that made them even better!  I highly recommend them.  The sound is clear, the music has great tones and bass, and phone calls have great clarity.  My husband has also had problems with headphones fitting his ears properly, and the design on these is perfect.  He doesn't have to push the earbuds deep into his ears to hear, and the flexible hook design keeps them on his ears while he's working or out on a run.

No more annoying wires for me.


These headphones work great! I purchased these after reading all the positive reviews and with the price of $36, I couldn't pass them up. I bought these because my department had been moved into a shared cubicle space. Wired headphones plugged into the computer were very limiting. With these, I can listen to music while working and not get tangled up in the cord, but they also aren't so noise cancelling that I am still able to hear if someone is trying to talk to me. I've also used these at home while cleaning. The only downside is you have to keep the phone in your line of sight, otherwise the Bluetooth will start to cut in and out, but you can get a nice distance away from the phone. If you're on the fence about these, I would definitely recommend them.

Love these headphones


We were skeptical  when ordering these, however, they far exceed our expectations. I gave mine to my husband and he is always critical about everything.  He loves these, nice clear sound and phone calls are amazing, he walks a lot and likes to listen to music, his other headphones would twist and skip. The only time these skip is if he turns his head . He always has trouble with the earpiece staying in and being comfortable, they usually hurt and he can't stand them for long, these are very comfortable and stay in, he has used them to walk, make calls, and even has them on when hitting golf balls. He would never have been able to do that with any other headphones. I ordered another set and should have them today.  We drive a lot and are quite often in different cars and have to communicate with each other, will be interesting to see how they do for this, we generally use LG headsets but they turn on the neck especially in winter, hoping these are the answer!!

Awful for working out


I can't believe there are this many favorable reviews for these headphones. The fact is, a lot of people are going to buy these for working out, and the main flaw is the over-the-ear piece, it is simply too flimsy to hold in your ear. They absolutely cannot withstand any pounding or impact whatsoever without falling out of your ear. Sound quality is ok, battery life is a few hours at most. Pretty lame that these garbage headphones are labeled ""Amazons Choice"".

Great sound for the price!  I use these for listening to music while exercising and for hands free phone calls while driving.  These ear buds work better than I had expected for both applications.  The sound is extremely clear.  The microphone seems to work great (no one complains about not being able to hear me like they did with my old set).  They are comfortable to wear and don't fall out while I exercise, not even when I'm doing yoga.  I cannot use the hard plastic type ear buds that came with my iphone because they hurt and fall out.  I give them two thumbs up!

Awesome product!!!


I have been using the headset for the last 4 days and they work just as described:* Great sound. It Is better that what i expected.* Comfortable enough in your ears. I have used them for 6 hours straight and my ears weren't husrting and they are pretty light (at least for me)* It charges in hour and a half (10 mins give or take) and I think the battery died after 6 hrs of continious use (didn't timed it properly)...the description says 8, but I think that is acceptable. Although I will time it next time.* All accesories included as described and the case is pretty cool.* As for the distance I think it has a good range. I have gone to a considerable distance, gone inside a server room and still get the signal strong. I haven't made a proepr distance test (~32 open space)  but so far it has proven to have a good range.* The microphone seems okSo I can say, so far so good. I still need to do more testing and see how it behaves in the long term.

I am very happy with these both as headphones and as a wireless phone. Pairing them has been easy and I've managed to get them synced to my phone and tablet which is great. Connection quality has been generally very good and when I asked people I'm talking on the phone with they never have trouble hearing me.Unfortunately my first pair did break after 8 or so months of consistent use but I was impressed by their customer service response when I asked them about the warranty. They did have me try a quick factory reset just in case that could fix it up but after that failed to work they are sending out a replacement set.I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone.

Nice sound; questionable life


These headphones have similar sound imaging as the Beats wireless version of a similar form factor.  Maybe a little less bass response but otherwise very good sound quality.  The ear loops are a more malable wire that is good for ear fit but less durable since they bend in the case. The accessories are nice and plentiful.  My headphones stopped taking a full charge after 6 months.  I ran with them for the last time this evening since they only lasted about 10 minutes with a full charge before shutting themselves off.  The charging chord is a nice design but stopped working after 5 months.  This kit includes a lot for the price.  Compared to the Beats, they cost less per month of use but I had hoped to get at least a year.  I only got 13 months out of the Beats so maybe I’m rough on headphones.

Not good for swimming, but great otherwise


I bought these for running and cycling. They worked great and endured 5 months of heavy use (i.e. sweat) without showing any signs of damage. I felt pretty confident in their durability, and since they're rated IPX7 waterproof, meaning they should withstand submersion in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes, I didn't think there would be any issue with me using them while I swam laps. I was wrong. I swam one lap with these in my ears, and they malfunctioned almost immediately. I couldn't get them to turn on after that, which was disappointing.Fortunately, the seller stands by the 1 year warranty. I contacted customer support and they were very kind and helpful and agreed to send me a replacement. They also told me that even though the headphones are IPX7 rated, they don't recommend using them while swimming or submerging them in water. Doesn't really make sense to me how these are certified as waterproof but can't be put in water, but I'm glad I learned that lesson before my warranty ran out.

Equal too or better than Big name brands!


All I can say is WOW! I've owned Beats (when they were made by Monster), Jaybirds, and skullcandy (louder than my skullcandys) headphones before and these are on those levels of loudness and clarity. For someone who has 2-12"" subs in his truck, I like loud but I also like it to sound clear at high levels. These headphones do just that, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.UPDATE: After a few months of owning these headphones I really liked them, they stayed in my ears while running and working out. But they cut out when I ran in the rain and they also cut in and out when you step 20+ feet away. I wouldn't mind it, but when I just walk to the water fountain it bothers me.

Originally gave it 5 stars, but did not last. See update.


An excellent bargain for the money. I would give it 5 Stars if it would tell you the condition of the battery when you turn it on. You only find out it's about to go dead when it tells you the battery is low. If I had known earlier I would have charged it, wouldn't I?UPDATE:  Not much more than a year later, the left ear piece intermittently goes out. No way to fix it. obviously only manufactured to outlast the warranty by the merest amount of time. Don't bother.

Just buy them.


These are impressive and extend way beyond their price point. The sound quality is plenty good for active headphones and actually good enough to listen to when not bike riding, hiking, etc. I was very impressed by how comfortable they are. I am very sensitive to textures and these were just right. Soft where they need to be and firm where they need to be and you can barely feel the ear loops, which is a first for me. Ussualy the ear pieces are uncomfortable and that is not the case here. The carrying case and other accessories that come with the headphones make them seem like a much more expensive product. For this money or even double, you can't go wrong. Just buy them.

lasted 7 months


They lasted 7 months; got them on May 1, 2017. Around December 1, they began to have connection problems - slow to not connecting at all, static and loss on the left (not control) side, but the worst is they now drop the connection after a few seconds to a couple of minutes. I'm using them with an Iphone SE and mac pro. The peculiar thing is that when I hold down the on/off switch, the ALWAYS say ""power on""; never ""power off"" like they used to.They were good while they lasted, but I expected more than 7 months for the price.

Inexpensive, Quality Bluetooth Earphones


- Charger plug is not durable.+ Everyone has a different shaped ear, I have difficulty putting earpieces into my actual canal. The hoop thing around the earbud served great to keep them in my ears.+ Battery outlasted a schoolday full of listening in class (Don't do that pay attention in school).+ Cheap+ If you take good care of these, they will last+ Sound quality is nothing short of impressive for a pair of Bluetooth earphones this cheap. Don't expect hi-fi audio from these, but you can expect earphones that work well when taken care of. Bass is amazing, Treble is amazing.I typically lose my earphones before they wear out, although after an entire school-year of shoving these things in my pocket, the cable came out from the charging port still attached, and the button was mashed in. When I expected these to have broken, THEY STILL WORKED. Everyone runs a different budget, but I can guarantee if you put these in the case, they are a major bang for your buck.Let these headphones blow you away for the price point, it is worth every dollar of allowance/salary/giftcard you spend on it.

These headphones are unusable. Trying to use them with amazon music on an iphone, the minimum volume setting is deafening. No way to turn volume down enough to use them. Contacted Senso and they were no help. Said to do a reset, which I did, but it makes no change.Trying to research this problem, it seems to be common with lower priced headphones. I will be looking for headphones that specifically say they can be adjusted to a reasonable volume when used with iphone. Buyer beware.

Sound is OK, but frustrating connection issues


The sound on these headphones is OK.  Not great, and not as good as my previous pair of LG's which were only slightly more expensive.I'm returning them because I they too often fail to connect to my phone.  I need to turn them off, back on, and after that, sometimes go to Bluetooth settings, wait for them to disconnect (on their own), and then reconnect from the phone.  Also, when interrupting a video for a phone call, the audio for the video does not always come back once the call is complete.Also, the packaging advertises noise cancelling, but in reality they do not offer this feature at all.  Understandable for a $30 pair of headphones, but still false advertising.

I would not order these again as they are not built to last.  They do have great sound and good comfort but they only lasted 1 year of limited use.  I use them only for the gym for about one hour per day.  I took good care of them and they look brand new.  Recently, they failed.  They began acting up by shutting down about a month prior and then they stopped playing and would not charge.  I contacted customer support and they offered troubleshooting and reset information.  Reset did not work and they promised me to send a replacement.  I received notice that they are shipping a new pair.  Then, the next day, they told me I was 1 day late on the one year warranty and would not replace.Understood that these are not expensive and not built to last forever but you would think that Senso would take care of the problem.  It was one year into owning them and they refused to bend being 1 day past warranty.  They said that ""the system will not allow it"".  Therefore, I refuse to promote or re-order their product.

Apple delayed their earbuds so I tried these and don't regret it :)


The item was shipped fast which is typical of amazon. These headphones are well packaged and come with extras. I have not test the iPhone charging cable yet but don't expect having issue with it yet. At first I was a bit concerned that the extra soft ear piece that helps with keeping the headphones in place was not going to work. However it works, and like others stated if it was harder it may be uncomfortable. I only listened to these few times for quick workouts and that tells me the battery will last the advertised time. The quality is good, not great however for 30$ you can't expect miracles :) I'm very happy with these.

They used to be great...until the design change


The first pair of Senso headphones I got were GREAT!  I used them almost every day at work to listen to books.  Unfortunately, I lost them.  So I got another pair exactly like them...so I thought.  It seems that they have changed the design of the ear hooks.  Now they are bendable and too flexible and won't stay on tight anymore.  The ear hooks are getting bent out of shape, and I absolutely hate them now.  I'm getting rid of them and trying something different.  Too bad someone decided to change them.  The product used to be great, now it's worthless.

Honest review- read it fully if wanting to buy.


Sound quality- ehhh its ok, granted you are only spending 36 bucks or so for these things. Personally i find it to be way to bass driven and not enough highs or mids present.Construction- biggest grips here are the large circles before the rubber ear drum inserts and the ear hooks.  The circle part seems to be fairly big and gets in the way of securely fitting in your ear canal. Maybe its just my ears but i have problems getting them in place and staying in place. Takes some fiddling around with these things in order for them to seat right. The ear hooks on these things are my next complaint since they are about worthless, hate to be harsh here but its the truth. They are super flimsy and offer no rigidity at all for support to the ear bud itself. Now they are super soft rubber which is awesome as they cause no irritation what so ever. Easy fix here is to have a piece of fairly rigid plastic be the ear hook backbone and dip or wrap it in the rubber they currently use.Microphone while in a call- Had multiple people tell me that it was hard to hear me while using these for a call. I had to speak loudly and speak super clear in order for the person on the other end to hear me well.Battery life is pretty solid on these things and meets the time listed in specs when brand new and fully charged.Overall I will be returning these due to fitment just being to much of a pain and the audio being way to heavy on bass for me.

I'd prefer a more organized packing.The Senso Pouch is OK The zipper is sort of a hassle and I'd prefer a clip or velcro instead, although the zipper is more secure.The controls in the earphones need some learning to do and you'll be OK.The instruction and troubleshooting booklet needs a rewrite to make it somehow more informative for not so savvy customers (my case) The R vs L sign should be made more conspicuous or visible.

I've had these for about a week and they do the job great. Good value for the money. There have been a couple random instances where the sound will cut out or digitalize, but it corrected itself after a few seconds. They come with a unique charging cord that has a changeable head do you can charge the headphones and then your iPhone. Unfortunately the lightning charger part doesn't work on mine. Kind of a bummer, but not a huge deal. I do find that they hurt my ears after about 30 minutes, because of the pressure even though I'm using the smallest buds. Overall I think they work great and I'm happy with them.

You won't regret getting these. I found them comfortable and secure. Sound quality is great. The accessory package is complete and even has a 6' USB to Apple connector as well as micro USB - useful little item for so many things. One small issue and the reason I did not give 5 stars - I cannot lower the volume sufficiently for just soft background music for meditation. The sound drops out, tried both phone and ear buds volume controls. I emailed the company after registering the product. Maybe they will have a solution. If not, then I can always use wired earbuds when meditating.

I bought these headphones to use on the treadmill and connect wirelessly to my TV.

I tried to plug them in, and the cord would not stay in to the headphones.  I tried to resolve with Senso because out of return window, but we could not get a response.

Good quality, sweat tolerant, adjustable fit.


I've never written a product review, but I love these headphones. I was looking for a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones to test out if I liked the bluetooth and these have worked perfectly. The battery lasts as advertised, after almost six months of use 5-6 times per week the battery life has not deteriorated. And I'm typically working out with them so they are not being treated nicely! Lots of sweat and the quality hasn't deteriorated at all. I thought I would have to replace after only a few months. The ear piece is a little bulky looking, but it doesn't bother me because the adjustable ear hook means they fit snugly and I've had no problems with them coming out during any type of exercise from running to HIIT to box jumps etc. I'll take the bulky ear piece over a box on the cord that would always be swinging around. I'm not really a sound expert so I can't really comment on that, but I've had no issues with sound quality. Great purchase!

Ok ..


I have mixed feelings about the earphones.Pros:Nice Clear SoundCons:1. Gives me a headache while all other headphones that I use do not give me a headache.2. Even when the sound is literally at the lowest level, it screams ""LOW BATTERY"" very LOUDLY. Makes one jump from the screaming. I would understand if someone is listening to loud music at a high sound level and it screams, then ok, but when one is listening to very soft music at the lowest sound level , the loud screaming becomes out of the norm.

This is or would have been a great product if I could have better volume adjustment capability


This is or would have been a great product if I could have better volume adjustment capability.  These are LOUD!  I had the volume down to the lowest possible setting and even with volume control and limit set, it was just too loud.  I would have rated them higher than two stars as their packaging is great and so are the accessories but the main function of the item doesn't work correctly.  I guess I will just have to keep trying and see if there is another pair which may work better for those of us who love music but don't want to go deaf listening to it.

Third pair!


I have been so happy with these, for the price point. My first pair has lasted 3 years. I use them in low noise areas, like when mowing or running my shop vac. The noise reduction is not great but they are comfortable, and do offer some protection in a noisy environment.

Best bluetooth headphones I have ever had to date


I normally do not come back and leave reviews but when you find a good product that works great and is better than advertized. I am buying 3 more pair soon. They work in rain and pair as soon as you turn on your bluetooth and the battery life is very good I have managed to get 6-7 hours before charging. Very quality sound ..Best bluetooth headphones I have ever had to date, the others just stop working after about a month or two. The Senso are amazing long battery life about 7-8 hours of use and the range is amazing, would highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for some good running headphones.

Bulky and look rather silly in your ears...


I was really hoping these Senso Bluetooth Headphones would work out as they are only 1/4 the price of Beats Wireless Headphones.  The set up was a breeze and the sound was great, especially for the price.  However, the headphones are bulky and look ridiculous.  I wouldn't wear these in public, even at the gym.  Imagine wearing two separate Bluetooth ear pieces (the type used for phone calls only) and you begin to get an idea of just how big these are in your ears. If you can get past the size and look, I would highly recommend these.  Unfortunately, I can't, so I'm going back to the more expensive, but smaller/sleeker Beats Wireless Headphones.

Great headphones that I use when I workout, while at work, or when going for a walk. Hold a charge for a really long time and has good sound quality. Would definitely recommend.Update: Less than a year later, after raving about these to several people they just stopped working. The power button no longer presses in.

Good earbuds for the price


I've had these earbuds for about 9 months, daily use, they are comfortable, easy to use, pairs reliably, buttons are easy to use, they have been very reliable.  However, at the 9 month mark, the charging light went out and after trying to charge it for a few hours to check if the light was just faulty or they are simply no longer charging, it was the latter.  I am leaving this as a 4-star review for now because they are a good earbud, and will see if the warranty (1 year is honored).

5/5 for customer service. bought a pair last year. one ear stopped working a month before its anniversary. no questions asked the guys replaced the broken one after some simple testing. with replacement on its way I bought another one anyways because the sound quality is great compared to another pair i bought called soundPEATS (it SUCKED). the quality and durability of the product is why I am giving it 3/5. I guess for 30$ you can't expect much. it doesn't stay on the ear very well. I have to adjust it often when I run. the replacement they sent me sounded different from the new ones I bought. It sounded low quality and without enough bass. I can tell which ones I am using without looking at the mark I made on the replacement headphones. I called customer service to complain about the replacement and with good reasons they made it very difficult to replace the replacement. so I sucked it up and kept the low quality replacement and use it for commute instead of running/gym. For 30$ it is not bad. I know I lose things or step on them all the time. if you take care of your electronics maybe research and invest something that has the same sound quality as this but will last longer!

They are also very clunky and look super dated. If you have smaller ears


If you have small ears, do not buy these earphones. The buds don't go in all the way and I thought curving the headphone to go around my ear tightly would help but it did not. It's also a pain to have to curve them around my ear every time I would want to wear them. These earphones are made for people with average to large ears. They are also very clunky and look super dated. If you have smaller ears, and want something that looks nice, do not purchase these. I was duped by all the good reviews... do not believe the hype.

Save your money!


So I recently ordered these because of the amazing reviews I read on here. They far outweighed the negative ones, and I thought I should give them a try. I needed a new pair a headphones anyways. I received the package brand new, like the description. However, the earbuds looked like they were worn out and used. The sound quality is not so great--I would not compared them to Beats by Dre. They also kept falling out of my ears--idk maybe I have small ears? Well for $30, I would just buy some regular headphones that would last the same amount of time and same sound quality.

Great, Pain-Free Earbuds with Quality Sound


I am one of the unfortunate people who cannot wear earbuds for and extended period of time because they make my ears hurt. As a result I resolved never to purchase buds again. While deployed in Afghanistan I saw Senso were being offered at a reduced price and saw that numerous people that had the same problem as me were giving these headphones high marks. I decided to give them a shot and I am glad I did. They have a clear sound with great bass. The battery life is as advertised.  I am very pleased with the product and would recommend these to anyone looking for a wireless headphone.

May walk and talk like a duck, but not a duck....


I bought these things of all the great reviews they had.  I ended up buying them and I thought they where great, played music, answered and called out.  I am a runner, so they would last all week and I would just have to charge them at the end of the week for the next week.  I was such a happy camper.  It was cold at the time when i started running, and I was always wearing a hoody or a sweater and covered my head.  As May came around it was getting to hot to run with a hoody so I stopped wearing one.  That is when the problems came, since I didn't have any pockets I went out and bought a fit belt that carried my keys and cell phone.  At first putting my phone in the belt I started missing music, it would cut out a lot.  I just thought it was my phone was old and that was the problem.  Than the wind started, so i can hear wind traveling into my ear canal.  That became even more irrating.  My wife bought be a pair of Beats can head set, so i started wearing those when I go out on my runs.  I can't hear the wind and the lost of signal stopped.  Was it the head phones the hole issue?  Yesterday, I did a 5k run in town, and used these head set again, and the problems came back.  Well the verdict is in, you pay for what you get it seems.  I would say these are a great entry level head set, but if you are planning on become a runner6-7 days a week and about a hr a day that beware you might have to buy something well better.

excellent customer service


Love these headphones but last weekend they stopped working. I emailed Senso and asked how to access the warranty to get a repair or replacement. They sent me info on how to reset the headphones in case it was a calibration issue and I followed instructions without success. I expected more of a hassle but they asked me for the order info and got information to send me a new pair. It isn't the exact pair, they were replaced with sports headphones, but they feel and sound the same. I love that it was a no hassle replacement. Top notch service really, in a world where that isn't seen often.

Ordered 2 pairs and both broke


I ordered a pair of these several months ago and enjoyed them while they I had them. I used them about an hour a day, 4-5 days a week at the gym. After about 3 months the right side stopped working entirely. I was bummed but figured I would just buy another set because they are so affordable. I got my new pair and used them about 6 or 7 times and the same exact thing happened. This time on the left side. Im guessing from sweat or something because I use the for exercise only but I took very good care of them. Needless to say , moving forward Im going to be buying something thats more durable.

Good ear buds


What i really like the most is how part that goes over the ears is bendable to fit your own ear. I had a pair the didnt have anything and they kept falling out of my ears and it was annoying. As far as music, it does have more bass then i would have expected and you cant adjust it, so it your dont like a lot of bass then this isnt for you. Over all i am satisfied with these head sets.

Works perfect


Perfect headphones for running, jogging, biking etc.  Also, works well at home when you want to listen to music or stream movies when the family wants quiet.  Never had a problem.  Charges fine and long battery life if you turn off the power when not in use.  But if you keep it on for the whole entire day without without much use, you can get a good 7 hours.  I once had it on for 5 hrs accidentally and towards the end (at night) streamed videos on Netflix and got a good extra 3 hrs.  Total of 8 hrs.

My son bought these headphones and recommended them to me


My son bought these headphones and recommended them to me.  I bought them based on his recommendation, plus the price was good.  I tried them out for the first time today on a run, and must say, I thought they worked very well.  The directions for use were easy to follow.  It was nice not to have the usual tangle of wires from my ear buds and iPod.  The sound quality was great.  I was easily able to adjust the volume and skip a tune, although the sound was consistently good so I didn't need to adjust the volume often.  All in all, I like these headphones and look forward to using them in the future.

Quality and sound 💜💙 great for price range


The headphones are very comfortable to walk or work out in. They pick up the quietest sounds in videos and songs. I love that they don't have to be plugged in to my phone so it gives me more freedom to do as I please. The life span is wonderful on them I just wish they lasted longer but thats unrealistic for 30 dollar headphones. They are also incredibly bulky ear buds that hurt my head if I lean on them while laying down or leaning against the window on the bus. Extremely uncomfortable for lazier settings. Otherwise I give them a 10/10 will buy again.. Probably. Unless I find ones exactly like these with smaller buds (mind you i have super small ears) Thank you for the wonderful service and speedy delivery! 💙

Will not fit under a ski helmet.


First off this kit comes very complete with a nice usable case, extra bud cushions in a few sizes, cords, 12V car plug.  It is a good value and hold a charge well.  It connects easily and controls are logical.Why three stars then?  1) sound is not nearly as loud or sharp as standard (wired) Apple ear buds.  Part of that has to do with fit and we all have different ear shapes but no size cushion improved this too well.2) too bulky to fit under a ski helmet, bicycle helmet. I wouldn’t even try a motorcycle helmet, though fortunately I have an expensive Sena intercoms/speaker for motorcycle.  I love skiing with music but these are way to thick for even a minute under a helmet.  Not even close.For gym use or general use these are good.

Great until they broke, we wary.


I enjoyed these headphones until I woke up one morning and one left bud was unattached and rendered the product useless. I had it for about....2 weeks and I thoroughly enjoyed them. The range was good for the price, the battery life was decent, and the sound quality was enough for me to be able to wear them and sing along for a while. Sad that that I did not invest in in the extra warranty as I still am confused as to how they broke. Left on the table when I slept over at a friends house and somehow just broke. I would recommend for the price but the downside is the cheapness in the build.

The sound and comfort on these are good. BUT, only after using four times of very light use, they will no longer charge. Tried all troubleshooting methods and nothing. Attempting to contact Invotek and will update if problem is remedied.Updated: I contacting the company and they were extremely helpful. They shipped out a new pair ASAP and so far the replacement work good. Only time will tell how long they will hold up. Will update further if any problems arise.

Best Bluetooth Ever


First the pros: These are great. The sound quality is excellent, they are comfortable with what feels like an ergonomic placement of the multifunction button - it fits your hand perfectly.  The controls are intuitive, packaging, case and accessories are well thought out, stable (these guys are not coming off) and the Bluetooth!!! The bluetooth is the best I've ever experienced. I can leave my phone upstairs, in the house charging and listen to whatever in the backyard. No cutting out and no loss in quality. Day three and I love these head phones.Cons: They are big. You aren't going to be stealthy with these guys.

I really like them, especially for the price. They're good for running, don't thump a lot when I step like other wireless earphones I tried.One star off because they do move a little bit, and while they don't fall out, I do find myself adjusting them frequently. I feel like it might just be me.Also, I'm very disappointed that there is no built-in functionality for Google Assistant or Siri. I'd really like to be able to double-tap the button and pull up Google Assistant instead of a redial feature.

Comfortable and a good value


The good - they are comfortable and work well. Easy pairing to an iPhone7. Comes with extras like a car charger and Apple lighting cable (which it doesn't need so this is just an extra).The bad - out of the box this is mixed for heavy, heavy bass. Fortunately Spotify has a mixer so I can balance out the sound. If you do not have the ability to adjust the bass, these would not be a good choice. I need to adjust the bass and treble whenever I use these. So it gets 4 stars for the inconvenience.

Excellent value and good quality headphones


I've only had the headphones for a week, but am very satisfied so far. They deliver crisp, clear sound no matter what I'm listening to. They can also get incredibly loud and thus far I haven't had to listen to anything above half-volume, which is impressive.The right headphone houses the controls, including the power/sync button, volume up/down, and mic. I've tried one call using the headphones, and the recipient couldn't hear me at all, but I'm not sure if it was due to poor signal or poor placement of the mic. The volume controls work well and there is a cap that prevents you from turning it up past a certain point. The right headphone also contains the micro USB charging port which I haven't even had to use yet. It has a rubber cover on it to prevent dust from getting in, which I thought was a neat little touch.I've had minimal issue pairing the headphones with my devices. They paired seamlessly with my phone out of the box, but took a few tries with my laptop. Be sure to disconnect any other devices the headphones are paired with before pairing with another device, otherwise it won't work. It's all laid out in the pretty easy-to-understand instruction manual. There was one instance where I was using the 'phones with my smartphone and the Bluetooth was still turned on on my laptop, and I was getting some feedback amidst the sound of the video I was watching. When I realized what it was, simply turning off the BT on the laptop solved the issue.I tested the headphones with some videos in addition to music, with pretty good results. Something happened consistently with YouTube videos where there would be a few seconds of ""noise"" after a video ended, almost reminiscent of the empty noise you hear when playing back a cassette tape with nothing on it. It wasn't a big deal, but it wasn't quite as seamless as I had expected. When a video ends, I expect to hear no sound coming through. I'm not sure what the source of the feedback was, but I had no other BT devices connected and it happened with multiple videos from multiple channels.Despite this odd occurrence, the sound quality seems really good. Highly impressive for a pair of sub-$40 headphones (wireless headphones, no less). Biggie smalls' voice boomed as it should and the thumping bass from ""hypnotize"" sounded pretty authentic. Furthermore, guitar riffs from ""Losing my Religion"" were crisp and each note shone through. Stipes's wail wasn't muted or tinny and I could clearly make out the fluctuations in his voice.As a package, the value doesn't get much better. The sleek packaging comes with the 'phones, a case to hold them, a bunch of replacement earpieces of different sizes, TWO charging cables (including a really nifty lighting and micro USB in one) and a car charger (and of course an instruction manual). Everything is packaged nicely and works well. It gives me confidence that the brand is high on their products. They advertise 24/7/365 customer service on the box, and I got an email from one of the company's ""owners"" asking how I liked the product, and notifying me that they were there if I needed anything or experienced any issues. Impressive.The final thing I want to say, and a partial reason behind rating 4 and not 5 stars, is how these headphones look. They look clunky on the ears, and while they feel good, they aren't exactly discreet,  and honestly look kind of silly when I looked in the mirror while wearing them. Also, it's really hard to use them with only one earpiece in. I was getting ready before work but was anticipating a phone call and I was using the sink, so I didnt wanna touch my phone with wet hands to answer the call, and figured I'd take the call with my headphones. I just wanted to have the right one in, so all I'd have to do was press the button on the side to answer the call and be able to finish my routine. However, it was near impossible to only have one in my ear, because the other one dangled and is weighty enough by itself to drag the other one out of my ear. It wasn't a huge annoyance, but with standard headphones I never had a problem having only one earpiece in at any given time.The takeaway I hope you get from this review is that you should by these headphones. From a value perspective, these are 35 dollar wireless headphones with massive sound and a whole host of extra goodies that make you feel as though you should be paying more. They aren't the most visually pleasing things in the world, and connecting via Bluetooth isn't completely seamless all the time, but they are a really good pair of headphones that are easy and fun to use.

Dead after half a year use


I've bough it for my daughter. Here is her feed back.The overall quality of headphones was great until it was not. Literally, the sound quality, the price, battery life, and all the other factors making up the bluetooth headphones met all of my expectations. Unfortunately, the period of their functionality was not extended, only 6-8 months. The sound quality of the headphones was impressive, especially for their price range. They did pair well with my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S7) with almost no troubles afterwards. The battery would last for about 3 days, approximately 6 hours of playing. The battery took about 1 hour or less to fully charge with no need for everyday charging (unless the headphones are used for more than 6 hours a day). The only concern is that at some point the left earphone turned off. This was one of those annoying cases where one of your headphones stops working until you put the cord in the right position. It would only work is the cord was at a certain position but then (about a week later) it stopped working all together. Shortly after, the right headphone turned off. (Note: the headphones were charged, recharged and left charging overnight). I would not recommend buying this product unless you want it to last for less than a year.Update: replaced by seller since warranty is 1 year

High Quality Bluetooth Headphones


I have only had these headphones for a few days, but thus far I am really impressed.  Bluetooth set up was quick and easy on my iPhone 6.  Sound quality is very good.  Used them for a workout in the gym and they stayed in place and sound quality was excellent throughout my workout.  Packaging is first rate and includes a complete assortment of accessories.  I have not had a need to contact customer service, they the fact that they have reached out to me proactively is an impressive indication of they desire to assist their customers.  Nice touch!

Good value - wish they had a clip


I have had these for about three months and have been pleased with them. I do have problems when using them for phone calls where the other folks will say they cannot hear me well, even though I'm in a quiet area and speaking up, so the mic quality may leave something to be desired, but most of the time I just use them for listening while running, and they've done well for that. The only thing I wish they included was a clip on the wire to enable you to clip them to your collar. I've had other bluetooth headsets similar to these and the ability to clip them to the back collar is very helpful when you only have one in or neither in, to keep them from shifting around (or falling off).

Five Stars


So far I have been very happy.  This is the 3rd pair of earbuds I have tried and they seem to be the best at staying in my ear so far.  While the sound is not as good as my blue tooth over the ear, they give me more flexibility than my over the ear.  I can wear them skiing under my helmet, under my earmuffs when mowing the lawn, weed wacking, or even using my chainsaw.  I love the sound you get from the over the ear headphones, but there are disadvantages to not being able to hear noises around you.  Try cooking with good over the ear and your pot is boiling over while you are not looking and you cannot hear it........  Overfill the sink with water because again, you are not paying attention and you cannot hear the water running.  Really like the balance the Senso's provide for the cost.  They allow me to have 2 pairs of Bluetooth headphones.

Headphones did not work do not waste your time.


I was very excited to get these headphones because of all the positive reviews. I got them and everything appeared to be made well and read the instructions to get them started. My first issue is that it said it only took 1.5 hours to charge, after 2 hours it was still not fully charged. It was plugged into my iPhone cube. After about 4 hours on the charger it finally got a full charge and then I went to connect to my computer and nothing. My xbox, my computer, iPhone 8, roommates iPhone 6 and roommates iPhone X all could not even discover the device let alone connect to it. Tried doing the factory reset to no avail. Further research online shows that there were almost 500 questions on this product on how to connect it and reset it. All the question responses were to reset it, half the other questions were ""I reset it, and it stopped working again what now."" From my experience and the quality of customer service don't expect to ever get these to work if they don't.

Not great for the gym, great else where.


they work is about all i can say. when i compare the hard-line factory headphones i can honestly say that the hard lines are a better sound. These make my phone calls sound soft but still comprehensible. They are great for running outdoors i guess. the first time i wore them in the gym, i would occasionally get interference and the audio would occasionally dip in and out. I reached out to the support contact and was told that was normal with Bluetooth devices. I now use them when i go running or if i am in the office, not at the gym.

They're good value for the money especially if you want something ...


Worked ok as bluetooth headphones. I've been using them exclusively for workouts for the past 5 months and this past week one of the two headphones became very low compared to the other one. I didn't bother contacting the manufacturer because I think the issue is due to my perspiration being extremely profuse and it's probably a simple issue of dry sweat on the speaker driver. They're good value for the money especially if you want something you won't cry over if it stops working. Update: Most recent pair lasted almost 6 months.

Pretty good quality


I used these at work and when I go grocery shopping because I get social anxiety with crowds of people and it puts me in a bad mood. The noise cancellation is pretty good without being too good, I can still pay attention to what's going on around me if I have to. The volume adjustment and ability to skip to the next to YouTube video right from the earbud is great. For the price the quality is pretty good but then again I don't listen to heavy bass music, I mostly listen to YouTube videos.

Best Bluetooth sound quality and ease of operation I've ever seen in this price range.


Only had these for a few days so far but they seem like the best set of low priced Bluetooth phones I've ever purchased. They are extremely comfortable and I can wear these and practice drums just fine. Sound quality is excellent. They also work pretty well for phone calls so far. I wish they would be connected to two devices at one time but I can handle that they cannot considering the price. Just the best value for the money I've found with excellent sound quality for music.  I'll let you know how they hold up for the long term.  For me: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Intermittently disconnects


Intermittently would disconnect. About 3 months after purchasing the ear buds would lose connection with my phone randomly in the middle of runs. I tried making sure it had a full charge. I made sure they were being properly cleaned. I reset their WiFi connection. Still would randomly disconnect. It didn’t happen with every use but probably 7 or 8 times out of 12 uses. Length of time into the run varied as well.Ear buds themselves had to be twisted n twisted again to get them to be comfortable and stay in place. Cord was long behind the neck.Would not recommend

Excellent outside use high quality for the price


I bought these May 2017 and they were perfect until about January 2018. I am a walking mailman in North Carolina  and I wear these every day for a minimum of eight and sometimes 10 or 11 hours everyday and I sweat profusely. I was worried about most models that will get wet when it rains or I sweat and ruin them; that was not the case for these. I never had a problem with water from sweat or getting too wet when I was being rained on and the battery always lasts the whole day. I listen to music, podcast,YouTube Red, audiobooks or some form of listening entertainment most of the day that's about 9-10 hours of solid use everyday and standby intermittently ( I turn them off when I drive maybe 30 mins all day) these are excellent for the money and the only reason I am replacing them is because they got tangled up and I got rough trying to separate the knot which bent one of the wires the right piece which has all the functionality still works perfect but the left side comes in and out since the price is low and I know the damage is mostly my fault. I will be repurchasing another set as they have been perfect through rain, hail, sleet, snow and almost  a toddler who tied them in a tight knot

Excellent fit and sound, quirky interface.


I have used these Senso Bluetooth Headphones since June of 2017 (almost 8 months).  For the price, they are a real value.  If you can deal with a few quirks in storage and human interface, they will serve you well.  I have used them while hiking, jogging, doing yard work and in rain, snow, and sunshine.PROS:- Great price.- Great fit (at least for my ears).  Used both foam and standard ear pieces.  Foam works best for heavy exercise.  Confortable for 2-3 hours a stretch.  I seldom push earbuds beyond that.- Long battery.  Usually pushing 10 hours.- Great sound, good base, decent highs, although a recent gift of PowerBeats3 earbuds have me experiencing far superior sound.  These deliver very good overall sound and work well for when you are on the go; better than earbuds that have cost more than twice the money.CONS:- If you use the semi-hard case that comes with them, the earbuds often turn on unintentionally.  Not good.  I've had to really watch out for this.  The main button (pause, take a call, etc.) that also switches them on/off  has no protection from accidental presses.- The controls are backwards from all other wearable blue-tooth appliances I've ever owned.  Annoying.  Forward button should skip forward and increase volume; back button should skip back and decrease volume.  They operate opposite of this.- The nifty USB cable that switches between mini-USB and Lighting gave up the ghost after 5 weeks of use.  All other accessories still work fine.

Great earphones but not for MY ears.


I liked these earphones, they are cute, easy to use and the sound is good. I bought them because I go to a loud gym and I wanted to dim the noise and listen to my podcasts. They didn't do much for the din with the regular ear tips but the foam ones helped alot. The cord that connects the earphones is annoying because it pulled whenever I turned my head. The big problem is the earphones are too big for my ear canals, I was unable to wear them for more than ten minutes or so before my ears began to hurt and I had to remove the earphones. I am returning them and will look for something for smaller ears.

Good Value


This is a preliminary review of the product:  Overall, I am happy I purchased these as I like to run with my OEM Samsung earbuds but the snag and drop potential is always pretty high.  The functionality is good and the value is better.I don't like the size of each earpiece and the fact they are pretty boxy. If you are a fashionista then these will probably drive you nutty.  The other issue is a noticeable buzzing static noise in quiet parts of the music I listen to.  Not a big deal since I'm running and don't require perfection.I've only used these headphones through one battery cycle and can't comment on how long they will actually last but so far they will exceed my run times. (~90 minutes)

Microphone for phone call  worked great per callers that called me at the GYM.  They could hear me without problem.So Sad.  Customer support was good too.  When it cut out it cut hard..

these headphones are fantastic. Sound quality is right up there with Beats ...


First off, these headphones are fantastic. Sound quality is right up there with Beats (which seems to be the competition that headphones like this face); the range is pretty solid and while the CVC 6.0 Noise Cancellation title is misleading (it's for the mic, not for the audio), the shape of the plugs still does a good job at blocking sound.Of course, these are just a stock set of bluetooth earphones that are made in China that anyone can put a logo on (WAVEZ, Senso, TreLab, SoundWhiz, Zeus and Tanyam are just a few of these options you can find on the website), and while this doesnt diminish the quality of the sound on the headset, it does mean that they have a tendancy to just... give up after a few months. I've owned 4 pairs of these Chinese earbuds, and without fail all four have stopped turning on or holding a charge after roughly 5-6 months of use. However, the one year warranty that Senso gives covers this too, and when my pair stopped working last week, the quickly responded to my email about the topic, and overnighted me a new pair. I was shocked when I got home from work today to find a new pair sitting there, when they had only just shipped it Saturday afteroon.So when buying, while you should keep in mind that the lifespan of this set of Chinese headphones isn't fantastic, the audio quality is (especially for the price), and the customer service is fantastic as well. Definitely worth a buy

Great earphones at an affordable price


Have not had long but so far they are excellent. I hear others clearly and others hear me which is my main concern. I primarily wanted them for safe cell phone use when driving or hands free talking, although they are probably used more for music.The only addition I would recommend for future iterations is some form of small weight centered on the cord for a more stable and evenly distributed feeling when resting it on the neck between uses when both ear phones are hanging down or when only using one side of earphones and the other is just hanging down.  Outside of that, they are crystal clear earphones without breaking the bank to afford.

Beats the Dre line, hands down.


Ordered on 2/17/2017, and year over of heavy use and workout an hr a day and they still going strong. Battery lasts maybe 88% from the 100% first use but still pretty impressive quality that shits on the $200 pairs. This is perfectly in sync with any audio device and absolutely no issues. The fact about battery life is that all batteries degrade with time and after a daily use to only loose maybe 15% is not bad at all onsidering i use them all the time. Excellent other end audio feedback when calling and comfort on ears. Thank you.

Has a chunky look and feel, but works great nonetheless


This headphone set was easy to pair with the my phone and simple to operate. Handling the few buttons seemed confusing at first, but once long-press for on and off was established, taking calls, muting/pausing, and volume control was intuitive. The built-in voice that indicates on, off, etc., is appreciated. Seems to have a range of 15 to 20 from its source before losing contact.After switching the ear pieces to one of the supplied pair that fits me, the SENSO had no problem staying ""plugged into"" my head.Reviewing before a mirror, the SENSO looks chunky/blocky on my head. Most certainly not elegant compared to higher-end models. Nonetheless, works and performs well.

I have been wanting to buy bluetooth ear buds for some time now. I am so glad I found these, the quality for the price is outstanding. Every piece of this product feels solid and I love the way they fit on and in my ear.  I have small ears and right out of the box these are perfect. I don't use them for sports but these stay in place for regular daily talking on the phone. The black and red color is perfect. They generously  give you a short and long cable and the carry case is quality as well. I would recommend these to anyone.

Incredible Value - Compares to $200 earphones


These are an incredible value. I own a lot of different pairs of earphones and headphones, from a variety of different price points.  I have to admit that I was skeptical.  I wanted a relatively inexpensive pair of bluetooth headphones, and decided that at this price I would take a flyer, and if they didn't sound good, at least I didn't waste a ton of money.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  They come in a nice box, with a number of different ear tip options.  The fit and finish feels premium.  The sound is great, and compares to The bass response is definitely emphasized.  In fact, I had to turn the bass down a bit on my EQ. The battery life is good, and charging is fast.  They stay put in my ears very well, and don't move at all when I run..

They work good for sitting around, not moving much


Got these head phones (ear phones actually) for when I walk and run. They start out good, but within about 5 minutes, if you have the transmitter (phone) on the wrong arm, the unit starts to miss the signal, cutting out etc.  Switch arms with arm band phone holder and it's better, within another 5 minutes, it starts to wig out again and cut out sound with the position of your arm.  If you hold still, you can even use it on the opposite arm or across the room. Would not recommend these for anyone being active.

They are amazing and fit so well they never move out of ...


Others have given very detailed reviews of these headphones. They are amazing and fit so well they never move out of your ears. I was coming from the regular standard wired apple headphones - they are so much more comfortable and about 25% louder. Due to the reviews I was thinking they were going to be so loud I would never have to use full blast but that wasn't true. When I work out, I like my music loud and it gets it loud enough but I did wish they went a little bit higher. I am sure my ears are glad they don't - never too loud but loud enough to drown all outside noise away. I was use to being able to hear surrounding sound, and while others will say they aren't completely noise cancelling - it was pretty darn close! I couldn't hear a word when people were trying to talk to me. Just saw their lips mouth.The only down fall I see is that they don't automatically shut off after a lack of use or blue tooth disconnect. User error on my end and now i am having to spend time charging them before I head off to the gym again. Once I get use to having to shut them off, this won't be an issue. But can be pretty frustrating when you aren't use to it yet. Other than that they are an amazing price for a very solid wireless set. I could run, jump, squat, deadlift and they didn't move at all. Worth every penny!

High quality sound at very reasonable price


Only had them since Xmas 2017 but they seem to offer high quality sound at very reasonable price. I prefer the foam ear tips but only one pair was supplied and Senso do not sell them.  This is a problem as I subsequently bought two sets - Kinden and Veritas.  Kinden foam tips are too big, and these were recommended by Senso. (I made the Kinden's fit but wrapping some duct tape around the nozzle posts, but feel that I should not have to go to these measures).  The ones from Veritas (2.5mm to 3.5 mm) do not fit the nozzle. Perhaps the larger Veritas would fit but I am not spending more money and time on this.  I have contacted Senso but yet to receive a reply on the inner core diameter of the foam tips, and the diameter of the nozzle. My estimates are that the former is 3.97mm and the latter is 4.5mm.  Comply says the 200 would fit, but I am dubious as the inner core of 5mm would exceed the nozzle.  Also spending approximately $20 on Comply's eartips (including shipping) seems ridiculous as this would be two/thirds of the price of Senso's headphones.UpdateOn Monday 27 May 2019 the headsets were failing to connect to my iphone 6s having worked with no problem up until this time.  The connection would last perhaps a couple of mins and then cut out.  Reconnecting was difficult if not impossible and numerous factory resets and unpairing/forgetting the device did not solve the problem.  Therefore the life of the product was about 17-18 months.  I had used the product approximately  400 days over this period at the gym with each session about 1.5 to 2 hours.  I suppose I got pretty good use from the product and perhaps given the purchase price of $30 should not complain too much but I feel let down.  My daughter has a pair that she does not use because the earbuds do not fit her small ear canals.  I will try those and see how they perform before the next purchase whatever that might be.

Great headphones that almost lasts a full year.


They are good and battery lasts long. They stay on during all my workouts on all different body weight exercises and machines w/ different positions, so that is nice.They don't get as loud as I'd like them to get.Sometimes the bluetooth would not reconnect to my phone (issue started at 7 months ownership).At 10 months ownership, the plastic casing fell apart on the right earbud where the power/vol controls are, and tiny pieces fell out and all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put SENSO together again.

These were painful


I was excited to purchase what sounded from reviews to be really comfortable Bluetooth headphones. I could not wear these for more than 10 minutes before I got a headache. The sound quality is very good, though, and it was easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy s6. I like the hard case it comes with, too.My ear openings are too big for the small buds and too small for the medium buds. I can usually work around this, but for this set, the ear hooks and the main electronics part add a weight and rigidity that was instantly uncomfortable to me. So, my search continues.

Initial review, seems like I scored a good buy!


I just received these so I will do an update once I get some time with them. Initial impression is that they have great bass for ear buds, they fit snug and have nice almost memory foam buds from the factory. (They come with extra rubber ones if you don't like the foam ones.) Also, they are LOUD. I only need to have them 3/4 of the way up at the gym, anymore and it's to much. I had the HD pump Bluetooth headphones before these. So far, these are much louder, have more bass and more comfortable. Will update as time goes.

Eh-


Updated- These were my favorite headphones. Others that I've purchased over the last few years don't match these in comfort. I like how they don't push so hard into my ear canals like many others do. These hang off your ears but stay in well. The BIG downside in connectivity. The sound drops in and out when I'm outside even when fully charged and the connected device is in my front pocket. Fine for indoors while exercising though. Not sure what the problem is.

Buy These !!


just got these a few days ago, they connected to both my phone (nexus 6p) and tablet (asus windows 10 device) fast and easy. I only really use them for skyping and the occasional call but the sound is awesome for what I use them for. The assortment of ear bud tips allowed me to get a great fit. The ear loops are very soft and flexible which seemed odd at first until I wore them and then I completely understand as they are way more comfy than the stiff ear loops. Overall, with a 1 year warranty, they are a good deal, especially for the price point.

I hope you have huge ears!


Are my ears too little? These don't fit me. If i plug the bud into my ear canal, the hook is way above my ear. If I hang the hooks on my ear, the bud is way below my ear canal. Since I wear glasses, I just put the arm of my glasses over the hook to hold them in place but that wouldn't work if I were running or using them at the gym. Also, there is a lot of interference/choppiness in the playback. At first I thought it was my book (poor audio quality) and then I thought maybe I was bouncing my phone too much - but again, these are supposed to be for sport. And even when my phone is resting someplace, the sound cuts in and out. Battery charge didn't last long either. I might just have to pull out the instructions to see if there are any tips before I pack them up to return.

Amazing Quality, Terrible Customer Service


The earphones are awesome at downing out backgrounds noise and amazing for all instruments, vocals, and other facets of music and audio I used then for. The issues that I had were apparent when I first got them in that they would cut in and out and sometimes Bluetooth wouldn't hold.  I had problems before the headphones stopped working altogether and tried calling the 24 hour number that comes with the product but was rerouted to the same person each time I called and he went from saying to yelling at me the same thing that they cannot and will not replace the damaged product and that the warranty basically just acts as a receipt for an already damaged product before it gets to your door (that is absolutely useless and betraying to any customer who thinks a warranty should replace a damaged product that comes in barely working as is, what's more if you read the warranty it is absolute garbage). Also when you're on hold they have a person repeating the same message of please wait and we will get to you when we can with no time stopping whatsoever.  Having heard this nonstop I was on the verge of hanging up just so I wouldn't be irritated for the 20 minutes until they finally answered. I don't know if they did this to divert people from calling or what, but absolutely the worst customer service for over the phone. As for why they got so many stars they got that for their email services that I would assume are not apart of their phone customer service because they actually listened and were willing to at last see the product. In the end they sent out a new pair of earphones to replace the originals. They deserve 5 stars but the over the phone quality customer service is what deserves the 0 stars. If the new the one work well and don't have the same problem then I see one less problem in them deserving 5 stars and being recommended.

Amazing Headphones, I LOVE IT!!!!


Those Headphones are really GREAT, i was so stupid paying more than $100 for some brands that are ok, but now that i just got the Senso i can say that have the same o maybe better sound quality, special the bass is really good, in general the sound is well balance, it fit perfect on my ears, and also comes with 3 different sizes in case you need them, the case is also really nice and usefull for the gym, the bluetooh is working good, i connect it with my Iphone 6 in just 1 sec lol, really easy, can go wrong with this, i recommend it 100%.

Five Stars


the sounds quality is average but he volume levels are great and the music doesn't bleed out.The ear prices stay in place for the most part but the rubber pieces around the ear to help them stay in are not adjustable and feel loose all the time.  I haven't had them fall out though which was my issue with previous ear buds.Overall I have happy with the product for the price. Not even close to being as good as Bose or beats version but for a fraction of the cost you can't go wrong.Comes with a lightning charger as well.  Doesn't work very well.

Originally purchased these headphones in January 2017 - I really started using them when the weather got warmer and they are my go-to headphones when I'm working in the yard, particularly mowing on my zero turn.A couple weeks ago, after about 6 months of light use, I took them off my head and they wouldn't turn off (or on) - the button just quit working.I contacted Invotek and let them know my situation.  I was very impressed to hear back from them within HOURS, not days.  Since I was well within my 1 year warranty, they just shipped me a  new set, which I received quickly - so quickly that I never even had to mow without them because the mailman showed up in my driveway as I was getting my mower out of my garage.  There was charge on the battery  and I was off and mowing with my ballgames and tunes!I was thoroughly impressed with the customer service, and for this reason alone, I give them 5 stars.  It's a good product (I hope this pair lasts longer than 6 months) and Invotek's service was as good as it gets.

I'm so glad the wireless earbuds I bought at walgreens bit the dust, because these Senso buds blow the cheaper ones through the roof.  These things give a nice deep bass or lows, balanced with clean highs.  It is like wearing mini stereo headphones, because the bass is there.  They appear like quality earbuds, nothing cheap at all.  The earbuds I bought at Walgreens, had a cheapish feel, and they cost me 25 bucks on sale, until I returned them.  These with the case, and extra cable and parts, you won't be able to match the price anywhere in my opinion.

Very loud. Great value. Wind noise while bicycling.


Great sound. Very loud. I listen to metal and rap. Very Good bass. Very good price. Great for running. I would give 5 stars... However, when bicycling, they create lots of loud wind noise over about 6 mph.  I have the jam on brand ear buds too . These Sensos last way longer and are way better. For 1/3 the price. Battery life on these is 7 hours on loud music.

Used to be a good product...


I purchased a couple of these in 2018 and they were great. The sound quality was good, the battery was decent, and the ear buds stayed on your ears. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. The quality seems to have dropped tremendously to match the lower cost of this latest build (30% cheaper than what they cost in 2018).The sound is really disappointing now. It's like they stripped out the some of the low and high frequencies, and now it's just mid heavy. The case feels cheaper, and they fall off your ears easily due to the larger ear hooks it has now(and yes, I've tried bending them to fit my ears). I can't comment on battery life because they sound so bad that I have not worn them long enough to drain the battery.I'll be tossing these in a drawer for emergency use and looking for another full time use headset.

Stopped Charging


The headphones were good when I first got them, but then after three months they just stopped charging out of the blue. I don't know what to do, I even tried some advice found here in the reviews on Amazon. I tried reaching out to the company but they never responded and their website is hard to navigate and it's hard to figure out how to contact them. I'm disappointed.

I use these for my long runs and whenever I'm working outside so I can hear my phone if/when it rings.  I have used these in the past and they have a long life.  I only replace them when one of the ear buds stop working but I probably get a full year out of them before that happens.  For the price, you can't beat that.

JUST AS GOOD AS BEATS!!! DONT WASTE $200+


So I went to Best Buy to buy some Powerbeats 3s. My nephew had just bought some and kept telling me I needed to buy some for the gym. We went and I tried to get a discount because Best Buy matches Amazon prices and I couldn't find the black ones that had been on sale for $150. I couldn't bring myself to pay $200+ for some earphones. I looked at Amazon the next day and came across the Senso earphones and started reading reviews and watching some YouTube videos and found some very good reviews. I ordered them and my nephew started saying they wouldn't work blah blah blah. I bet him $50 these would sound just as good as his Beats. Well I got them in and I was blown away by how good they worked. As soon as he got home we compared them to his Beats. There was a small difference in the sound of the bass. He was surprised at how good they sounded as was I. So I won $50 but told him to keep it. I figured him realizing I paid $35 for some earphones that are just as good as his $200+ earphones was good enough for me. DON'T BE MATERIALISTIC YOU DON'T NEED BEATS!!

I liked them enough that I bought a replacement pair


I bought a pair of these and had them for about a month before I lost them. I liked them enough that I bought a replacement pair. The sound is decent on these headphones. To get good base out of them you have to really have them plugged into your ears.  I had no issues getting them hooked up to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S5). They can hurt the cartilage in your ear after wearing them for an extended period. The first pair I ordered came with a case, extra ear buds, a short usb charging cable, a long usb charging cable with an adapter for USB C on the end, and a car charger. The second pair came with a short usb charging cable, and a magnetic phone holder that was missing parts. The case for the second one also reeked of stale cigarette smoke, as did the headphones themselves. It took about two weeks for the headphones to stop stinking. The case was simply a matter of spraying it with Febreze until it didn't reek anymore.While I am disappointed with the different items included with the second set I ordered, and with the stink of cigarette smoke, the headphones themselves are good enough to warrant only taking one star away.

really good headphones - great price


these Bluetooth headphones are great.  I bought two pairs of them, just in case one dies while in the middle of a workout.  a voice tells you when the batteries are getting low.  it would be better if it was more than about 5 minutes notice.  once she warns the batteries are getting low, you only have minutes until it dies, which is ok.  the sound quality is good and they are loud enough (I have had to return 2 very expensive headphones because they were not loud enough!  what?)  very happy that I purchased these

Sound quality is rather poor


Unboxed, charged fully, and connected to my iPhone 6s Plus without issue.  Played some tunes and I was really disappointed by the sound quality.  The bass is very distorted, and the highs are nearly tinnitus inducing.  I'm by no means an audiophile, but man, these are terrible.  Everybody else seems to feel that these are fine, but I am not pleased.  Am I expecting too much from them?  I've had better sound quality from a cheap pair of wired buds I got at a dollar store.I also connected these to my laptop with similar results.

A Very Good Set of Headphones...


While the Senso Bluetooth Headphones I purchased were a gift for a friend, I did want to check them out because I am looking to purchase a set of Bluetooth headphones myself. I was able to inspect the headphones and was pleased with the build quality, particularly of the soft rubber ear loops and silicone pads. The headphones also came with a nice set of accessories as described above.My friend reports that they are easy to pair, sound as good as his daughters Beats, and are comfortable.Now all I have to do is wait for Amazon to get more in stock as they were sold out this morning.

Poor Replacement


I purchaesed a while ago to replace my old (now broken) Senso ear buds (without the awkward ear loop piece) which I thought were 5 star for sound, battery life, comfort, and range...I could be quite a distance from my phone and still stay connected clearly. These new ones, however, are lacking in all those departments. So uncomfortable, poorer sound quality, no range (I must have my phone on me to stay connected). Not good at all.

When i found out these were the same as the beats (which is over rated crap as far as im concerned), Literally a different molded switch cover, over the identical electronics, same earpieces, cord and everything else for way less than the cost of ""look, ive got money cause i wear beats"" I had to try them, so i did. And im glad i did too! They do everything that i ask of them. They can (for me) be worn for hours and hours with no discomfort whatsoever. Loud enough, and crystal clear, no matter my activity. I can heartily recommend these to anyone.

I don't usually write reviews. But I have to say, these are the best headphones i have ever used. The sound quality is great for my needs, which is mostly phone calls and listening to lectures. They are light weight. I forget that i am wearing them. I am not technical, yet I was able to pair it easily with my iphone 7 without any issues. They arrived promptly. And all the added accessories (which I did get with other headphones) came in a convenient smart looking round case. They come with a 1 year guarantee and great customer service.

I would say good quality for this price range. I got this earbuds for running week ago. Before I had LG tone couple of models sound quality is way better but they are uncomfortable for running because plastic part always jumping on you during running.  This earbuds seat on your ear comfortable all the time and even when you are wearing them and sunglasses at the same time which I do.  But sound quality is 4 stars out of 5. Very convenient to have box for earbuds which will protect them in the backpack. Quality of microphone is poor it is totally not noise protected and people who I talk to was complaining on the sound quality. I am giving 5 stars because in this price range I doubt you could find some thing better.

Let me start by saying that I NEVER write reviews but...I LOVE these. I am so picky when it comes to how earbuds fit. I bitch and moan about any earbuds I've ever tried. The apple earbuds hurt, most fall out or slide around too much when i sweat and workout. These are seriously amazing, and for the price (insert jaw drop). The sound quality is fantastic. The last pair of bluetooth earbuds I bought were not loud enough, and its not like I'm listening to heavy metal trying to blow out my ear drums.

After 11 months the headphone will no longer stay connected to my phone. They will connect for MAYBE 3 minutes before disconnecting altogether. The headphones are charged to 100% and I've tried some ""troubleshooting"" I've read online but nothing works. Looks like another pair of headphones are going in the trash.I will say that while they were connected the sound quality was great and so was the battery life, which to me is what I look for in a pair of bluetooth headphones.

Horrible connection issues.


Sound keeps cutting out as if it has a bad connection despite being wireless and has minor yet routine static, popping and other white noise issues while using it. Its range is also confoundingly bad. I can leave the connected device laying on a table about 6 feet away and the connection will get no worse than stated above, however If I simply have the device its linked to in my front shirt pocket (so that it's no more than 16 inches from the headphones) and I so much as put my arms in over the shirt pocket as if working on something in front of me or so much as turn my head to the right, I lose sound. Let alone if I keep the connected device in a pants pocket, then it becomes unusable. I tried to link it to other devices and had the same issues with the headphones and I connected other Bluetooth headphones to my devices and had no issues with them, so through process of elimination I've concluded that the problem is indeed these headphones and not the other devices.

Good quality headphones for a good price.


So far, I have no major complaints with these headphones. Having gone through several pairs of really expensive high-end headphones, and an untold number of low-end wally-world specials, these sit right smack in the middle in terms of quality and price. There is some reception issues when attempting to work-out with them on - namely if your phone is in a back pocket - but overall they work without any issue.My only complaint on these headphones would be the weight after an extended period of time. When using them for a 3+ hour bike ride, by the end, you can definitely feel them pulling down.

It's a no from me.


First off, I ordered these almost exactly 2 weeks before this review and they no longer work, I'll let you take from that what you will. When I first got these they worked great. They were tuned a little too base-heavy so I just adjusted that on my phone and after that they sounded pretty good for the 20 some dollars I paid. I should mention that these are not $170 headphones like the MSRP claims but I really doubt they're fooling anyone with that, these should be priced no more than 35 ever based on sound alone. Based on nearly every other measurable characteristic they are just awful. They are not ""waterproof"" to any degree, I used them to work out and whenever I would sweat and try to use them, I would get a distinct and persistent shock. The ""noise canceling"" made no noticeable difference from any similar headphones that do not market themselves as such. Finally, today when I tried to use them at work I was greeted with a sound quality comparable to AM radio in a thunderstorm. Lyrics are now unintelligible and any bass is no longer existent. So much for ""HD sound"". My advice: look for a pair that doesn't need to market itself as 80% off to get your attention.

Purchase considerations to stem consumer choice paralysis.


I recently purchased these headphones and I must say I'm very impressed. Sometimes when I make a decision to buy on Amazon, I think too much, do too much research, get overwhelmed and finally suffer consumer choice paralysis. I had just about reached that point with this purchase when I went ahead and pulled the trigger, with my final thought of ""What have I got to lose?"". I'm certainly glad I went for it. I exercise daily with my headphones and finally got tired of wired earbuds. I would pass them under the collar of my T-shirt and then connect them to my phone which was in a neoprene case in my arm. The problem came to a head when I work biceps which would stretch the Velcro closure causing the case to fall. With wireless earbuds, that is a problem of the past. I considered a jaw bone type headset, but then realized the bone would bounce annoyingly around my neck when I do cardio. I considered a more expensive model with longer range but I realized that I keep my phone within arms length anyway so I can text or answer calls. Finally I considered cost, quality, comfort and reliability. The cost is on the low end and many times, ""you get what you pay for"" but not with this item, the sound is crisp and loud and the pairing and directions were a snap with an IPhone 7. The interchangeable buds fit nicely (I have a little cauliflower ear in one side, so I just put a one smaller bud on that side). Finally it's all backed by a one year warranty. So what do you have to lose?

Make sure you put them into your ear canal


Had these for many months and I couldn't understand all the hype about them because to me, they didn't sound anywhere near as good as my other much more expensive headphones.  That was.. until I finally figured out that they have to be literally 'pushed' into your ear canal.  I was just hanging them by the hooks and letting them rest in my ears, but then I randomly pushed them a bit harder, and lo and behold, WOW factor kicks in.  These headphones are spectacular.  Complete noise-isolation, clear soundstage, and simply mind-blowing bass!  Add to this the hours of playing time on a single charge and a featherweight form-factor, and I have to say this is a beautiful diamond to own.

Biggest negative is the battery life...they die pretty quickly and you must keep them on the charger between use.  I use mine on the motorcycle to get GPS directions and they are OK but can only be used with my half-helmet.  They are too big for a 3/4 or full-face helmet with doing some modifications to the helmet.  The sound is OK for GPS voice but not very good for music.  Mine are a bit scratchy and the bass is almost non-existent.  That said, they were not expensive so I was not expecting much.  The bluetooth connection to my phone and GPS was easy and works well.

Top notch customer service and quality.


These headphones were a lot better than what I originally expected them to be when I bought them. They had a small kink in the wire sheath when I unboxed them, but they worked fine so I didn't bother sending them back. For just shy of a year they worked great, until somehow, the sheath pulled apart in my gym bag and the wires became exposed (Note: My gym bag is like Mary Poppins bag if it had been bitten by a werewolf-hulk hybrid. There are days that I'm afraid to reach into it...) Anyways, after I noticed the tear, I emailed Senso, and within minutes they had processed my claim and have sent me a replacement pair. I haven't experienced customer service as efficient as theirs. Nothing can beat great customer service in my book.

I've been using this for a couple of months now and I really like this product, meaning that I would buy it again if I lost it.  See below for detailed review.Sound Quality: pretty good, not great.  Obviously it won't be like listening to a Bose or Beats type.  But still really good for working out and working at the desk.Battery Life: Battery lasts about 6-8 hours.  It charges fairly week, 1 hour should be enough for a few hours of use.Fit: I use it when I'm at work in front of a computer and while working out. It stays in pretty snug and secure.  It's actually so secure it gives the illusion of noise cancelling headphones.Connectivity: the bluetooth connects just fine at the office when working.  At the gym however, for the first 5 min, it cuts in and out.  Probably due to other Bluetooth devices nearby.  That's the only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5.

The kit comes with three different size earbuds to ensure a snug fit.  I've used this headphones while running and working out at the gym and I'm very pleased with their performance thus far.

It stops when separated by a door - range of distance not so far


Got these headphones a couple of weeks ago. I was dissappointed because they are not as good as my previous pair. I tried these ones thinking they would fit my ears better. They fit my ears better, but they are not as great. They start to halt everytime I go into another room (very near and sometimes only separated by a door). And the range is not as far as what they stated. My previous ones won't have any such problem. It is a bother to return them but I wish I just ordered my old headphones.

I have purchased two pairs of these headphones and have recommended them to others as well


I give five stars for both sound quality and customer service. I have purchased two pairs of these headphones and have recommended them to others as well. Had a little connection issue after having them for about a month, contacted Senso who provided me directions on how to resolve the issue. This worked well for about 4 days then the issue came back. Contacted customer service again and they proved me a brand new pair, no questions asked. Phenomenal customer service and really good headphones. For the price you just can't go wrong. I use these daily for both leisure and exercise. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good set of Bluetooth headphones.

Wish sound quality was a little better


I like these headphones, but I really wish the sound quality was better. I bought them to replace an ancient set of original Moto S9 headphones I wanted to retire.  I like this form factor better.Good- battery life is good, I like the indicator shows up on my iPhone- Comes with multiple tip sizes and carrying case- easy to useNegative- Sound quality isn't that great, need a tight seal for any sort of bass response. Not sure how much of the overall sound quality issue is due to bluetooth vs, these headphones.  Same content on wired headphones is way better though.- Bluetooth range in my experience isn't great (tested with iphone 6S, 7, and 8), very prone to interference. Signal would breakup with my phone in my pocket on walks.Overall these do what I need them to do.  I just use them for listening to podcasts or music while walking around the neighborhood.

Dead after only 4 months


After only 4 months, these headphones are completely dead. From the moment I bought them, there were issues with syncing to my paired device. It would sync, work for a bit, and then the music would start skipping. To solve this, I would have to turn everything off and resync the headphones, which usually took several attempts. After this nuisance, they usually worked for the duration of my run.I grabbed these for my run this morning, and they would not turn on. Even though they still should have been charged, I plugged them in to the charger, but they did not indicate that they are getting a charge. Tried a different charger with the same result. After several hours, they still will not turn on.

Better than earphones @ 3x the cost of these


This is the 6'th pair of bluetooth earphones that I've owned. Easily the best sounding, with a big dynamic range. The highs and lows are better than phones that I've paid $140 for. They are also very comfortable as they are made of soft rubber over the ears and connecting wire. Changing to the smalles earpieces made them most comfortable for me. Very nice cables and case included. They have a great range and battery life. I haven't used them for more than 4 or 5 hours at a time, but they have not yet gone dead on me between charges. I waited to write this review due to the rubber band style being a concern for quality. So far, they have held up very well. I wear these to bed sometimes, something that I couldn't do with other phones. Have no complaints and recommend. If any quality issues arise, I will update this post. Great price. Buy

Good product


I just bought a pair of these earphones, because I was tired of not being able to listen to music and charge my iPhone at the same time.  So far, I'm happy with them.  They came with clear instructions for charging and using them, and the sound quality is fine.  I haven't tried wearing them for jogging yet, but they fit well don't easily fall off when I'm wearing them around the house.  I was pleasantly surprised that they came with a carrying case, and a couple of charging cables.  All in all, this looks like a good product.

Not ideal for outdoor cycling (wind resistance)


Cyclist review:PROS: These headphones are loud, they seem highly resistant to sweat, and Bluetooth works great. They come with interchangable ear pieces (for small/med/large ear canals). They hold a charge for me for the entire week (~8hr runtime, est.)One Major CON: They really catch the wind and are pretty much useless if you don’t have a skull cap or some sort of fabric covering them. I’m not sure I’ll be able to use them at all in the summer. If you aren’t biking with them, don’t worry about this, they’ll be great.

Muy mala durabilidad


Compré 3 auriculares el 04/02/2020. Los hemos usado diariamente unas 2horas al día solo a la noche sin tenerlos en movimiento. A los 6 meses uno de ellos comenzó con un falso contacto en el cable del lado izquierdo y dejó de emitir sonido de ese lado. Hace unos días volvió a pasar lo mismo con otro auricular. De la tienda me dijeron que estaba en garantía pero aún no me ofrecieron una solución. Ya no estoy ubicado en usa. Espero poder reemplazarlos por otros de mejor calidad ya que la durabilidad de estos fue pésima. ¿Cuál hubiera sido su vida útil si los hubiera utilizado para correr como dice la descripción del artículo?

The quality is really good of the earphones! I can hear people well. On the other hand at times the person I am taking to on the phone when I am in the car they can hear the background noise of the radio.When using the earphones at home or with the car radio low you can hear the person really well on phone.I liked them well that I ordered another pair to keep in my gym bag.  Very nice quality. The packaging was very sturdy and the extra item the company adds for use was really good.

They sound great but are terribly uncomfortable regardless of the size buds I use. The real problem is battery time, 2 of the 7 days I have used them they died in under 2 hours . Volume and charge time were both about the same on all days so I am a bit puzzled. Will see in another week.About a year later and I threw them in the camp fire, they would not stay connected and cut out numerous times per song. Listened to my play lists over the lousy phone speaker for the rest of the trip without incident.Save your money and don't buy these,they are junk.

Awesome sound and Awsome quality.


I've owned a lot of headphones and ear buds.  So far, these are by far the best ones I've tried.  They are the first headphones that I can turn the volume up to the point that they are too loud.  In other words, I can actually hear the music and movies.  The are very comfortable and I hardly know that I have them on.  They are easy to pair and I have been able to pair them to my IPhone and IPad at the same time.  The sound switches between the two devices very well. I would recommend these to anyone that wants a great pair of comfortable, inexpensive high quality headphones.

Awful Pairing


The Senso Bluetooth headset has a great sound quality, great carrying container, and a good charger. I was overall very pleased by the high quality.I however, am not pleased by the pairing and internal connection device that is used. My phone will automatically try to connect to the headset, but it somehow confuses the radio even  if I follow pairing directions; hold power button for six seconds until light flashes red and blue, and I do! But the device WILL NOT pair. Even if my phone does not try to autoconnect, the headset will fail to pair a third of the time!I've done the factory reset option multiple times but to no avail. I often have to completey RESTART my phone before the device pairs.Not only that, but sometimes the device pairs only to the audio, meaning my ""on ear"" controls will not function. I then have to pull out my phone to change the song, lower volume, or pause the song all together.The physical quality is high, the device is comfortable, but the device has terrible pairing issues that make it almost useless.Disappointed by the lack of high quality internal components.

Best Damn Earbuds


I've been buying my earbuds based on Consumer Reports' recommendations, and was never disappointed, but never blown away either. Somehow, I got turned on to Senso's Bluetooth S-250 phones and was blown away. This is my second pair so that I have a charged pair always at hand. I can hear words in songs that were so crisp and clear that I couldn't believe my ears...literally. Maybe you can get clearer phones for a couple hundred dollars more, but WHY would you bother? These are great; they last (for me at least) a minimum of 6 hours on a charge; and are comfortable as all get out. Do your ears, and bank account, a favor and get these phones. They are, quite simply, great.

These are the best earbuds I have ever had. I am hard of hearing and have tested a lot of brands and models that can play loud and clear enough for me. These are the best by far!

More practical than Bose with lesser sound quality and price tag


For the cost, these are great. I bought them as a replacement for my wireless Bose earphones, which were having issues with the rubber housings. The SENSO headphones don’t come close to the quality of abode, but it is a fraction of the price. And something that I couldn’t find before I bought the SENSOs, they can pair two devices at once. And unlike the Bose headphones, the SENSO headphones don’t have a problem deciding which device cuts over the other. The SENSOs play sound between the two without a problem. No app required. It’s a good buy.

Very nice.


I use these while traveling, working out, and doing yard work.  They work great.  The only con I have is that it seems like when it's connected to my phone it always reads 90% (sometimes it shows 70% but rare) then out of nowhere seems to beep and indicate it needs to be charged.  Don't get me wrong, the battery life is great and gives you hours of life but it's hard to gauge how much life is left.  Would recommend!

These Headphones Rock


Look, I just bought these a couple of days ago, and have used them twice while jogging, so I can't speak towards how durable they are, but I agree with most reviewers, that these are good headphones for the money.  The sound quality is good, and I had no problems inserting the ear hooks, and they were comfortable, and stayed firmly seated into my ears while running.  The directions on how to setup and use them are good, and the headphones are pretty quick to charge (like an hour). You can use any USB charger or your computer USB port to charge. The BT Bluetooth feature paired easily with my Nano IPOD, and the sound quality was excellent in my opinion. Very happy customer.

I've been using this headphones for a few months now, and I've gotta say, there're great! I listen to a lot of music, and these things last from when I leave the house at 7:30 to when I get home from work around 5. The sound quality is great. The design is great too.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that the bright LED flashes periodically, which is unnoticeable during the day, but can get a bit annoying when I'm listening to podcasts in my room at night with the lights  off.If you're looking for an affordable wireless headphone set, buy these!

Wind interference and keep falling off from the ear


I am surprised to see this product has so many 5 star ratings. I bought this headset to use  during runs. I wanted headset that stays in place and not falling off every 5 minutes. After reading positive reviews, i ordered this product. It was delivered in good package and on time. When I tried it on, ear hook was too big for me. I tried to adjust to clamp on my ears but did not fit. I gave it a trial run outside. Wind interference is terrible. You can hardly hear the music when it is windy. Left ear piece kept falling off my ears. I tried to fix it several times but no luck. Sound quality is mediocre, it was loud but i didnt mind.  I am returning this product.

and they're great! The audio quality is not perfect


I bought these mostly for listening to podcasts, and they're great! The audio quality is not perfect, but I figured that would be the case when paying less than $40 for wireless headphones, and honestly it really doesn't need to be very good when listening to NPR and the like. It'd be passable for music. The balance seems pretty bass biased, but I guess that's just what people are into. My only real complain is the persistent, low volume hiss. However that's been present in most wireless headphones I've used, and I've definitely had worse.Bottom line: these are a great value! If your requirements aren't super high or you're on a budget, these are an excellent solution.

Not a secure fit at all


First, the good stuff.  It has nice sound for the price.  Bass is good for what it is and has quick connectivity.  It comes with great packaging and varying earbud sizes.Now for the not so good stuff.  The fit is awful.  The earbuds do not stay secure no matter which size earbuds I used.  The ear hooks do NOTHING.  The ear hooks sit too high and cannot be adjusted.  They provide no extra security and are more of a nuisance and annoyance.  I could not exercise or run in these.  They just don't stay fit on my ears.I returned them and will get something that will have a more secure fit to my ear.  Disappointed.

Great buy


Bought these mainly for gym use. I use them 5 times a week, for about an hour and a half each day, and i charge them at some point over the weekend, so the battery life lasts me the whole work week which is a huge plus. One day i put them in a plastic bag with a water bottle when i went kayaking, and when i opened the plastic bag to get the headphones, it was flooded (water bottle completely emptied inside bag) and they had been floating there for about an hour. Still worked flawlessly even after being mostly submerged for some time. Definitely recommend these.

Great headphones, sometimes connection issues.


These headphones are great. They last long on medium volume and the sound is pretty good. Phone calls work good on both ends through them as well. I use these at work and they don’t move or fall off my ears, even when I’m upside down. The only problem I have is connecting with my phone sometimes. They are paired to my iPhone but sometimes it doesn’t show up on Spotify to listen through them. The headphones will control my music but won’t play it. I then have to go to settings and disconnect then reconnect them to get them to work correctly. I know it’s not my phone or my music apps because my more expensive headphones didn’t have this problem before they went out. Besides this, everything is great and this is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.Edit: 4 months later the headphones turn off randomly and disconnect once in a while. Every 1-10 minutes. Will be purchasing a different set for more money to try them out. Dropped the rating to two stars because of this.

bluetooth worked just fine - no issues on this front


Bought this looking for headphones to wear while jogging. (At the price of ~38, on sale down from 130)Solid construction, came on time, bluetooth worked just fine - no issues on this front.Otherwise, a couple things.(1) As other people have said, these aren't really jogging headphones. I will second that. They are surprisingly big and heavy - not while walking around, necessarily, but absolutely while jumping around. They'd either fall out or get too uncomfortable after a short time. (I would guess, at least, I only put them in once and just knew right away it was a no-go.)(2) Also, they are loud. Like - LOUD!! So loud, and the audio quality is terrible. All bass and lower frequencies, otherwise very flat.TLDR: if you're looking for something that you can walk around the house and listen to a podcast or something that you don't need / want good audio quality for, these would work fine. (Provided they're still marked down from that frankly ridiculous initial price.) Any other case, keep looking.

I really love these headphones! They are the 1st pair of wireless headphones I've ever owned and I must say, these are great!!

They are a nice comfortable fit and I haven't had any issues with them falling out! I would also like to add that the customer service from this company is AMAZING!  I've received a few emails from the company, one prior to receiving the headphones and one or two after I received the headphones.  They were very much on top of things, nice & efficient. Answering questions without them being asked, they attached a guide for the product, & also covered all info needed about the 1 year warranty that comes with this product, they gave me steps to take if I had any issues with the product, and they were overall very impressive about making me feel appreciated as a customer!! 5 stars all around for this purchase!

You get what you pay for.


These headphones aren't bad for the price. The reason for 3 stars is they are not adjustable to fit around ears, which I has small ears so they don't fit well. The bud that fit in the ear are great. I love the memory foam ones. Only other downside is I loss connection easier then I would have thought. I just turn my head and it drops out. Also the cord behind the head gets snagged on my shoulder and pulls the other side out easily while biking. But like I said they are not bad for the price. Sound is good.

At first I was fascinated with these little guys, they came with a carrying case and multiple eartips. But that's pretty much all the positive I can say.Sound quality: regular, I had issues with loosing audio and bluetooth connection issues with my phone which was literally next to the earphones.Battery life: is one of the biggest issues with these ones, just around 1-2 hrs of continuous play.And see for yourself: the cables are damaged with normal use, 3 years later.

Outstanding headphones for the price!


These are by far the best wireless Bluetooth headphones I have owned and have since purchased a second pair for my wife.  I have tried others which either fell out of my ears while walking, or working out, and/or the battery life was dismal.The pairing instructions were straight forward and worked without any problems, my Samsung 7 Edge recognized and paired with the Senso right away.  The Senso headphones pack great sound, has good reception when the cellphone is in a pocket, and reception to/from while talking on the cellphone is excellent.  The buttons are conveniently placed on the right bud, and the On/Off/Answer/Disconnect, as well as the volume controls work flawlessly.The battery life is excellent, although I have not tried to go non-stop for the rated 8 hour battery life, I have used them on long walks, or working outside all day with the battery still holding a charge after 5-6 hours.  I have a pair of Bose noise canceling earbuds which I use on airplanes, but whether it's working out, working around the house, outside work, the Senso's are now my goto for all my other activities.

Comfortable, but terrible sound quality. Low price point isn't worth it.


Summary: While comfortable and light, the sound quality of these headphones are only slightly better than the ones they hand out in your average airliner. I use them mainly in the gym and everyday listening. I'm selling them and getting another pair.Sound: I have absolutely no clue how these are so popular. The sound quality is terrible, it really is. It's actually very muffled. I've owned a few sets of headphones including skull candy, bose, and mpow, ranging from budget to high quality. While the price of these isn't high at all, I definitely expected a lot more out of them. I listen to multiple genres of music, from light to hard rock, and I can't even discern a few instruments I would normally hear. Even listening to podcasts, speech sounds distant, almost like it's behind a wall. Again, very muffled. Not happy at all.Packaging: Great, fantastic actually. You get a carrying case, a couple of mini USB chargers, a double port USB plug, and a few ear plugs for the headphones. Was pleasantly surprised.Comfort: I've never been a fan of the over-the-ear style headphones, but these are pretty good. They don't scratch or stick to your head or anything. They're light enough to not be a burden but fitting enough to not fall out either, even during very active periods like running and jumping.

Bought these to wear primarily on my commute to and from work (I ride a bus or take light rail into downtown Houston). These work great with my iPhone and are comfortable for hours at a time. The noise-cancelling feature works alright, although not enough to drown out every noise. I'd highly recommend these to anyone looking for high quality, hands-free headphones.Update: I bought another pair for working out. I work out 3x a week, fairly intensively. These do a decent job, although with the soft rubber piece, the headphones can get jostled during movement. However the fit is very comfortable and the range is pretty good. I can set my iPod down and walk about 30 feet away and still get a strong signal.

+EDIT: Bumped from 2 to 5 stars) Lasted 2 weeks..


The headphones worked fine for 2 weeks, no noticable problems.. After that, the outside part of the cover fell off when I set them down, but it clipped right back on so I didn't worry about it. Later though, after I set them down for awhile, I picked them up and noticed the micro usb receptacle used to charge them had come loose and was floating around inside the earbuds. So I have no way of charging them and they are sitting dead on my shelf.. I tried contacting Senso but they didn't respond, and now my return period is up. Disappointed at the moment but, if Senso can fix this for me, I'll bump up the rating to five stars.EDIT: I looked in the box the earbuds came in and found a 1 year warranty. After registering that, I contacted Senso again and they were able to send a replacement pair. I don't know how long this pair will last, but I'm giving them 5 stars for the support team.

Buy it and you will not be disappointed!


Item is great, price point is amazing! My only issue with these is that even just walking the dog when the wind blows causes wind noise. The different ear buds don't appear to be able to fix this issue. Newer versions of the product will need to find ear connectors that conform better to stop the wind noice. I have some BOSE wired ones and the ear buds are perfect and no wind noice is made even in high winds. Other than that, this item is perfect on all other fronts. Buy it and you will not be disappointed!

THEY'RE GREAT!


I bought this several months ago and I must say that I am most pleased with it's performance. BOSE maniacs will hate me for saying this but I also own a wireless bluetooth BOSE headphones( I use this at my home and the SENSO in my car) and quite frankly they're both compatible. In fact although the BOSE has a built in protection factor does not allow you to max out the volume to possibly be a hazard while driving, the SENSO does nto have this built-in so it;s an advantage for me but at the same time I don't overdo it as I tend to be a defensive driver and keep the volume not loud enough to be a hazard factor. I LOVE my SENSO!

RECOMMEND for sure. Fantastic bluetooth over-ear buds.


So far, these are absolutely amazing. Very comfortable with 3-4 extra buds for different size ears. It even includes a set of foam buds. The sound is incredibly good for the price. Decent bass, no static. I cannot yet report on battery life. I will update after I have used them more. Add on top of all of this that it came with a hard shell carry case, a sleeve to stick to the back of your phone case for a credit card or even business cards, AND a magnetic car vent mount for my phone is just ridiculous for the price.

Sounds Like Old Soup


I hate in ear headphones, so I went in knowing I wouldn't love these. I did not expect them to sound like such garbage. Can't listen to audiobooks or podcasts in the gym - they just aren't loud enough. No amount of tweaking the equalizer will make music sound decent, either. When these break - which may be never, the build quality is pretty good - I will be relieved to not use them ever again.

So Far a GREAT Product......


It's been about two weeks & I think it's time for a review. So far I am truly enjoying the sound quality the bass and the feel of these SENSO Bluetooth Headphones. I've never had BEATS but I have had BOSE. Honestly these give you just as great a sound at a truly great price! The only downside so far is sometimes the connection goes in and out but that was after a few hours if listening to music. I haven't had any problems  while talking to someone  on a call  I haven't gotten a chance to workout while using them so I can't give any input on that. Overall I standby my 5 star rating. Thank you INVOTEK & SENSO I'm glad I waited and found such a great product.As I continue to use these I will make further reviews let's see if they make it to six months

Really nice comfy headphones and no cords! Very nice extras in package too.


These are great Bluetooth headphones for a really good price. I already have a pair that I use at work all the time so I got another pair for home. They are easy to put on and noise cancel at open office. The charge really fast and stay in use for more than full work day. Connect really easy to iPhone every time. Using these as cellphone headset the person on other end can hear themselves so the mic is really sensitive.  Sensor also sends very cool case and car cig lighter charger and a VERY COOL charge cord that does both iPhone and micro USB!!!!

Great quality headphones!


Right out of the box, I looked at them and thought ""here we go"".Then I held them and thought the sound quality can't be as good as these things look and feel due to the light weight. I felt them and everything was rubberized which I loved.Then I prepared to pair them and I've never had an easier time pairing a Bluetooth device in my life! Why isn't everything this easy??Then I put them on. After a couple adjustments, they fit perfectly. The rubberized everything makes them extremely comfortable, and they move with me as I do my HIIT and crossfit workouts and jump around like a fool as I do.Then I began the music, expecting to be disappointed. Nope. Great sound quality. (And I'm a tough audience.)Also, look at everything these things come with!The gist: Amazing earphones, great price for the quality AND quantity you're getting. You will not be disappointed getting these. Highly recommended!(Note: I was in no way nudged to give this product a positive rating. I truly am a fan of these!)*Update 1/11* Dropped a star. These are still great sounding and fairly comfortable, but I do a lot of HIIT and burpee-type exercises, and so far, these are just failing to stay in my ear.I also dropped that star because looks aren't the first thing I think about, but it's fairly important. These stick out of your ears moreso than the photos suggest, making you look a little silly.So unfortunately although these are great for the price, I'm forced to return them and go with the Phaiser BHS-750s.

Good backup pair


I had them just over a year. Use them primarily for the gym. I always put them back in their case after use, but recently a wire has started poking through the wire sleeve. Going to pick a different brand as a replacement.Pros-connects easily via bluetooth-sound quality is good enough (primarily listen to edm and rap)-no issues with battery lifeCon-for some reason the ear ring is extremely large and won’t fit-broke after a year-the sound can be too loud and unable to turn it down any lower

This is the best one, Excellent product.


This is the best one, little issue is the holding part on ear when you wear jacket in winter, but still fits well, manufacturer have to improve cord  could stay on skin well, during conference call good for hear, sometime trouble when your turn to speak on this headset, you have to loud little but it's good, worth of money. This could save your many dollars compare other big brands, I listen music my friend bought $199 worth similar from big brand name, when he listen my SENSO, he returned it and buy SENSO.. excellent and recommended.

Had to return due to echo during phone calls


I really wanted to like these headphones. I bought them to use as a wireless headset for phone calls with my clients. Unfortunately, they created an echo effect on the client's side, which they found was so distracting they couldn't hear what I was actually saying. I don't know if I just got a dud pair, but after using them for a number of phone calls with different clients and family members, I had to return them.They would be great if I was only using them to stream music. So, if you don't plan to use them for phone calls, these are a comfortable set.

Purchased and liked these headphones - for the money, they were good to listen to my audiobook. Soon after getting them a small piece broke on the casing and while the audio still worked, I was unable to wear and play theoff, etc.  I contacted the seller and after a brief conversation with customer service I was sent a brand new pair of earbuds, which I have been using for a few weeks. I'm happy with my earbuds and more than happy with the customer service I received from them  Senso!I'll definitely order from this company if I have a need in the future!

Great product and even better warranty service. I had these ear pods for about 10 months when they developed a short and the left side stopped playing. Sent a message to the seller and tried a reset. When that didn't work they sent out a replacement unit within the week. Easy no hassle thank you for supporting your customers!I will mention this for you runners out there. This set of ear pods only problem is wind noise. If you are running into a headwind it can be pretty loud and drown out your music. Just FYI...

Purchasing another pair


I might have already wrote a review a few years ago, but my pair finally crapped out after constant use. For $20 I will gladly buy a replacement pair. For running or the gym, who wants to be wired to their cell phone? The quality is excellent, they hold a charge for many hours, and stay put in my ears. Don't know why they stopped working; one day they just wouldn't turn on. But after four years? Totally worth it!

Adjustable piece around the ear is great! Decent sound quality.


I like that the piece that goes around the ears is bendable, so I could secure them around my ears. Very comfortable and responsive buttons. Found them simple to pare with my devices. Wish they could be pared with multiple devices simultaneously, but they get the job done, so not too concerned. Wore them during my 5K this morning and never had to mess with them at all during the run. I like the case that came with them too.

The one thing that I like the most is that they fit on my ears ...


For $35 these buds are worth it.  First the likes.  The one thing that I like the most is that they fit on my ears well.  I bought them to use mainly at the gym but used them in the car today for a biz call and my rep on the other end said that the quality was good.  Second like is the sound.  I'm mainly listening to 80/90's rock so I sort of want it louder but they are pretty loud and descent quality.  I really like the volume, pause and skip controls on the right bud.  Convenient. Now to the one or two negatives.  The cable that connects the two buds I assume is supposed to go around the back of your neck.  When your neck sweats (at the gym) the cable sticks to your neck so when you turn your head it sort of tugs the buds out of your ears.  This is not a deal breaker because it's manageable plus you can put it in the front.  The other problem so far I was able to fix.  When I originally started using them they wouldn't hookup to the Bluetooth very well.  I used 3 different Samsung S6 and S7 models and both had probs.  After reading some of the questions on Amazon, I found a reset fix and they've worked fine since.  Very satisfied.

I love my new Senso headphones


I love my new Senso headphones. Now just to be clear I've only had them for about a week. These are similar to the Dr. Dre Powerbeats that I paid $200 for. By which I had five pairs within six months that I continually had to take back to the Apple Store.this was last year before Apple took them over. They would break because when I run I sweat a lot. So far these headphones are much louder, They are just as comfortable oh and did I mention they are only 1/5 of the price. The reviews on them were great,so I took a chance. I'll keep you informed. So far I have used them on two 4 mile runs . I'm still on the same charge and they are still working great. Thanks Senso!

Working great so far!


Very reasonable price and works great once you figure them out. I had no issues with my phone coming unsynced when in another room even like some reviewers reported. Maybe this has more to do with your signal strength but not sure. I was able to put my phone down on the counter and move around rooms no problem. It only got weaker when I went outside. I love using them when working on projects so I don't get head phone cords wrapped around door handles or stuck in the dishwasher:)

Excellent value for average sounding earbuds.


In my search for affordable wireless earbuds, predomonately for use at the gym, I settled in on these.  They are not perfect, but for the price, they are an excellent value, which bumped them from a 3 star to a 4 star.Pros:  Outstanding value.  Tons of cool stuff in the package.  Two charging cords, case, USB car outlet.  Very nice.Cons: Sound is mediocre.  I really wish they were crisper and cleaner, but mostly just muffled.  For $35 though, I'm keeping them.  To a lesser degree, I wish they had made the connecting cord out of something other than rubber, as the rubber sticks to your sweaty neck.  Again, not a deal breaker at this price point.

Great earphone for walking / running


Went looking for an inexpensive but quality ear phone for my exercising. My old ones took constant fidgeting and the rubber ear pieces kept coming off. The design of these earphones allow them to stay put given I can wrap the piece around the outside of the ear and hold the actual ear piece in place. Sound quality is excellent and battery life is perfect (I haven't run out yet so don't actually know how long they will last).Great value with excellent quality.

So i was ready to pull the trigger on a pair of Powerbeats and spend the $200, I'm glad I didn't and decided to buy these at the last minute. For $20 these headphones are AMAZING, they have good bass, good volume, and a great value. I use them primarily in the gym and they work great.

I’ve had these for nearly 1 year now and they are still going strong. No issues. These headphones are fantastic. Like many, I was weary about the low price, figuring they can’t be too great for such a low price. But I was wrong. Great sound quality, easy connectivity, comfortable, and great battery life. I was going to buy another set this past prime day but saw that they have come out with a new model. I purchased the new model and will write a review for that one after I’ve given it some time to either impress or disappoint.

Good product, annoying quirk with the battery.


Generally speaking, I like these headphones. 3 sizes of earbuds allow for a comfortable, snug fit. Sound quality is good, and the Bluetooth range is solid. The only real complaint I have relates to the battery. According to the product description, these phones are supposed to have a battery life of around 8 hours. So far they seem to be getting pretty close to that. BUT, when they get down to 30% (my phone shows a battery gauge for the connected headphones), they make a loud ""Battery Low"" announcement. This wouldn't be all that bad, except the announcement repeats EVERY 30 SECONDS. So for the last approximately 2+ hours of run time, your music or podcast is interrupted every 30 seconds letting you know your battery is running low. This is annoying enough that it makes the functional battery life of the product much closer to 6 hours than 8.Am I missing something? Does the product melt in your ears when the battery reaches 0%? Why is this announcement so important it needs to be repeated every half minute for over 2 hours?

Very comfortable!


The tips really stay on which I like because for some reason I tend to lose these on all the other earbuds.  The wrap around the ear piece is flexible so you can bend into what position you feel is comfortable.  I've never had an issue with the other earbuds wrap around ear pieces even though they were hard but this is a nice feature.  And not something about the earbuds I appreciate the bonus card holder that sticks to your cellphone (handy for those of us that don't always want to carry a wallet as well as a phone).

Why this was a perfect purchase -


I had never tried Bluetooth earbuds before and I love them.  It was easy to connect my iPhone to the earbuds.  There are two charging cords, a short one and a long one, and one of the two cords has a very clever micro plug and also a lightening plug. There is a nice carrying case and various additional earbud tips.  BTW, the tips are comfortable gel and not hard plastic.  The controls are big enough and easy to feel with the buds in my ears.  The sound is very good and the sound separation is good.  Even though the earbuds have a battery that lasts around eight hours, just in case you are out at a picnic and the charge runs low, the box has a duel port car charger so you can re-charge in your car.  There is nothing else I could want from a little box of Bluetooth earbuds.  I am very happy I bought this specific set for my first try with Bluetooth buds.

Great for a year


These were really great while they lasted. They fit and stay better around my ears than any other cordless headset I’ve bought. I guess for most electronics these days you can’t expect them to last more than a year but I’m still kinda bummed they just stopped working almost exactly a year from when I purchased them. Now they will connect to my Bluetooth for a couple seconds but then turn off so basically they’re done. I’d rate them 4.5 stars for how well they functioned while working. My only complaint (besides the 1 year shelf life) is I  wish they gave you more of a warning when the battery was dying. They only tell you when you have maybe 3-6 minutes left.

These are the absolute best headset I have owned. I have a higher end set that does not compare to these. The sound clarity is awesome and the bass is spot on. I would recommend these to anyone. Had a problem with connectivity after using for 6 months, contacted the company and they were very helpful with a simple reset to original default. They come with other goodies such as a dual android/iphone charging cable that acutally works, dual plug car charger and different size ear bud rubber. Great product

Great sound, easy operation-but they've started falling out of my ears! Grrr!


For going to the gym and getting sweaty the last thing I need to do is spend $200 on a pair of pricey wireless headphones or earbuds that fall out. Senso's product is rugged, WON'T FALL OUT OF YOUR EAR, is extremely easy to pair, and delivers great sound. What's not to like about them?I have to amend my review. I've changed earpieces several times since they have started to pop out of my ears at the gym.

Not the best in the game but they work great!


If I could give this 4.5 stars I would.  Can't beat this item for the price.  It doesn't compare to pricey bluetooth headphones like PowerBeats or Bose, but you are paying $200+ for those.  I have the PowerBeats3 as well (my wife uses them primarily).  The sound is not as clear and crisp as the PowerBeats3, but it's not something worth the difference of $170+ between those products and SENSO.  Some people say you can't notice the difference in sound but I do, but like I said it's not a big enough of a difference for me to fork over that much more money for PowerBeats or Bose.  These headphones fit securely and provide a great barrier from outside noise.  The buttons are big enough to where you can find them while wearing them which is a big plus for me.  I only wear these during runs/workouts but if I were someone that used bluetooth headphones more regularly, I might be more inclined to purchase the premium brand.

I'm having a hard time liking these. I got them to use while biking, but they have a lot of wind noise and they start to hurt my ears after about 30 minutes. They also tend to work their way out of my ears over time. Otherwise, they connect right up to my phone and play music fine. Decent sound quality, but nothing special. I'll try to find a use for them, but will likely give them to a friend that they suit better.It's also a bummer they can't be left plugged-in to charge overnight. A bit inconvenient.

Great move for great sound


I've been very skeptical in buying the Airbuds as I could not get the wired buds to fit my ears - how was this going to happen with buds not even connected together?  With the new series IV iWatch, I needed something to use for workouts.  What a great choice I made with the Senso Headphones!  Easy setup and good sound quality for the cost!  No, there is no concert hall sound, but the bass is quite reasonable that the sound is NOT flat!!  Perfect for on the go travel and workouts.  Don't miss the beat!

Simple, efficient, and cost effective wireless headphones.


I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones to wear while working out (running, lifting), while keeping a low budget in mind. I first went with another pair on amazon for about $15, but they had poor sound quality and would not pair to my phone properly.Then I saw these and decided to give them a try, especially since they had good ratings. They work extremely well, fit well, and pair with my phone seamlessly. I'm not a huge buff in terms of sound quality, so someone smarter and more versed might disagree with me, but for me they get the job done. Block sound, provide decent bass/treble. My only gripe was that they plug straight into your ear, which I tried to avoid bc apparently you'll go deaf eventually, but I suppose its somewhat unavoidable. If you are looking for a simple replacement for your wired headphones for exercise, these are the way to go. Simple to use, efficient, and cost effective. What more could you want?

Good sound and battery life, new ear pieces are worthless, connection worse than old pair


I had a pair of these initially with the static ear pieces and bought a second pair for at work and home. The moldable ear pieces don't hold their shape and fall off my ears. Still haven't decided if I'm going to return them or not. Not super happy about ordering the same exact product 6-8 months later and getting completely different accessories and hardware. The headphones even sound different than my old ones.

Very good inexpensive Bluetooth headphones


Bought these to replace a set that I had for almost a year; they were great but I didn't use the carry case that was included (instead just stuffed them in my pocket when I went to the gym) so eventually a wire wore out.  I'll use the case with these new ones!These headphones give very good sound quality and have outstanding battery life. Pairing is a snap and the connection distance is very far - I've had times I left my phone on an equipment and walked almost to the other end of a large gym building before I lost connection and knew I had left it.The only negative I have, and this may be true of any earbuds, is that when walking outside, wind noise almost overcomes the audio being delivered by the earphones.

They're a little bulky but still really comfortable (I have several ear peircing like my tragus and cartilage and these don't bother them at all).

they are perfect for any type of activity


I am a college student and I use these headphones about every day. Either walking to class or going to the gym, they are perfect for any type of activity. If you are working out and would like a pair where the cord is not in the way, these would be helpful. They are Bluetooth and have a small cord, so they can still hang around your neck and will not be in your way.The headphones have great sound quality for the price. The base is good and not over the top. If you are looking for something to help you cut out sounds around you, these do a great job. These headphones have a voice action control, which is nice because it tells you when your battery is getting low, when the headphones are on/off and when someone is calling you. They will stop the music when someone is calling, to give you the chance to answer.Many people have difficulty finding headphones that are comfortable and that fit well. If you are like me and have small ears, finding headphones that do not fall out is impossible. These finally fix that problem. They have hooks that wrap around your ear, helping them stay on. It comes with different size buds, so you will be able to change to what fits you best. Not only do they fit my ear, they are also very comfortable. I have had them on for over 3 hours and never felt any discomfort. If you tend to sweat a lot, you will not need to worry. These headphones are waterproof and will not cause discomfort or damage.The battery life is impressive for these headphones. I wear them for about 2 hours every day and I only have to charge them about once a week. It only takes about an hour to charge. These headphones are easy to connect to your smart phone. The first time you have to let them sync. But every time after that, they will automatically sync when you have your Bluetooth and headphones on.The only con I have about these headphones is the charging port. It is tough to open and it takes a little bit to get used to. It is very flimsy and could easily fall off. If you don’t mind the charging port to be showing, it might be easier to just take that off.Overall, great headphones for only $30. I would highly recommend if you are looking to not spend much, great sound, good quality and comfortable headphones.

HOME RUN OUT OF THE PARK....


More than expected.... Great quality, sound, package & overall product. I use it to run. I was looking for something not too expensive but not cheap & reliable,  read the reviews of the SENSO & decided to go for it. Really impressed with the product and all contents. It even has a case in addition to the ear buds replacements... Oh and a car charger & a long & a short charging cable. HOME RUN OUT OF THE PARK. Awesome job team. I was also looking for the gray one mentioned in one of the reviews to see if I liked too.

Good for the price but still lot of scope for improvement


I recently purchased the headphone after trying two other products Mpow and  Anker in the same price range. I'll keep senso definitely at a higher side from sound quality wise but you pay an additional $10.I definitely agree that the bass quality of this headphone is superb no other brand in the same range can match it. I had two objective before I buy this headphone. One was sound quality which I'm very much satisfied and another one is fitting, and I'm ok whatever I got. But I felt a major concern that sometime the sound is cutting, sometime after connecting with the phone I'm not immediately not able to hear any sound, not sure what's the problem though this is not consistent. But I fear after few months it recurs I wont be in a situation to replace or whether Senso will fix the problem or not. Another thing I noticed that the pictures in AMAZON website is WRONG, it's showing car mount and a mobile bag as a bonus item but it actually comes with car charger and phone cable, this is misleading.Anyway overall it's good with this price range so even if with this problem I wanted to try my luck and keep the headset as there is no better option.

They dont fit under a motorcycle helmet


I was hoping that these would work under my motorcycle helmet, but they stick out too far to fit.The zipper on the case broke on day 2.On the plus side, the pairing was simple, the fit is comfortable and the sound is not bad for earbuds.  Full sound, maybe a little bass heavy to convince people that they're better than they are, but overall Im impressed with the quality.

Fun Product


Right price and works as promised.  The exercise routine is a bit easier when there is music in the background.  I am not an audio expert, but to me the sound is excellent.  I bought it so the ear buds would stay in my ears, however, the noise cancelling, sound reproduction, water resistant design and a reasonable price make this an outstanding product.  BTW, had a technical issue with the device and contacted SENSO tech support.  Received a response in about 20 minutes with easy to read and follow instructions on how to correct the issue.  After two minutes the issue was resolved and I'm back to the music.

I previously purchased these same headphones for my daughter a few months ago and when I listened through them, I was amazed at the great sound quality; so, I promised myself that Senso would be my next purchase. Well I fulfilled my promise, to myself and received my earbuds a couples of days ago...only used them 1x and yep, the sound's great. What I'm also impressed with, is their great packaging. The Senso box, the case for the headphones...they even added a 30in usb cord for an Apple device AND a car charger too! I don't have an Apple phone, but can lend it when needed. And yes, it does come with the usb for android. Oh and not to mention, it comes with a 1year warranty as well.So far,👍👍👍👍👍😊

Really good wireless headphones and GREAT Customer Service!!!


I love these headphones. They stay in place no matter the activity (running, biking, lifting weights, etc.,) The sound is very good and the battery life lasts for my longest runs (marathons). Recently the pair I had stopped working and I couldn't get them to turn on. I did a negative review on Amazon, and I was immediately contacted by the company with some suggestions to fix. Unfortunately they didn't work, so they sent me a brand new replacement pair within two days. Now that's great customer service. Prior to these headphones, I had the Beats wireless, which cost five times more, and although the sound was a little better, but not much, those beats came apart on the earpiece and were unusable. I could buy 5 of these headphones for the price of one Beats.

TLDR: 11/10 These headphones are pretty sick, would buy again.


I have to say these are pretty fantastic. Before purchasing, I always check reviews on Amazon as well as outside Amazon (what sold me was the NerdyTech article on them). So far I have had them for three days and have used them for activities of various intensities and have thoroughly enjoyed every second.Potential buyers should be aware that, as with every wireless headphone, there is a maximum distance you can be from your device before there is signal failure. Even so these headphones do a wonderful job of fighting to connect when I walk too far away and the always connect when I'm back within range.

Best bang for your Buck Workout Headphones!


I have used these headphones a few times now. I originally bought them for running but I think I like them more for lifting weights and I love them for running too. I am not a technology guru. I needed a pair of headphones that I could use that wouldn't fall out of my ears while running and subsequently while lifting weights and wouldn't get in the way. I love these headphones because I can do decline pushups/burpees/squat jumps etc without worrying about them falling out. When running, they have a sort of whistling wind noise that I wasn't expecting. When you think about it though, the side of the headphones aren't designed aerodynamically so while running you can hear the wind whip by (depending on how fast you run lol). I was initially concerned that this would be annoying and that I would rather my wired headphones. Once I turn my music on, I don't even notice the noise. The only problem that I have had with these headphones was with my run this morning. I don't know if it was the connection or what but I listen to a training app and it kept dropping for less than a second at a time. This only happened for the first ten minutes of my workout. After that no issues. Also it wasn't dropping long enough to really miss anything that the trainer was saying. So all-in-all it was not a big deal. Lastly, I have used these headphones, 3 or 4 times since charging them for about 30-45 minutes each time and my phone says that they are still pretty charged. Yes, when paired with my phone, it shows how charged the headphones are.All-in-all, I'd absolutely recommend these headphones if you are looking for a decent set of headphones for working out. If you are looking for beyond crazy sound quality then maybe these aren't for you. My boyfriend is all about Bose because of sound quality and all the features and levels of noise cancelling and a bunch of stuff that I don't know about or really care about. I'm usually a $10 pair of wired headphones work just fine for me. Or the ones that come when you buy a phone lol. But as a novice regarding sound quality and bass or whatever, I think these sound great even while running.

Great value headphones! Comfortable too!


I use these headphones for listening to podcasts, youtube videos and listening to books. I find them very comfortable, having the various bud sizes is a great option. They have a good battery life. You are warned not to over-charge them, and especially not to charge them overnight, so I set an alarm on my phone to remind myself to unplug them. I love not being tethered by ordinary headphones, I used to get wrapped up in the wire and hated that! These meet all my needs and at a much more reasonable price.

Great quality, wish they were adjustable in size


I use these for running and love the fact I’m not wrestling with wires anymore.  The battery lasts for hours, they connected easily to my Bluetooth and the sound is great.  My only challenge is the way they fit.  I am a woman and they are a little too big. The ear piece is comfortable, but the part that holds them over your ear is too big. I thought they were adjustable. I have to use a headband to keep them in place, but sometimes have to fidget with them when I’m running.  They fit my husband perfectly.  They do work very well and are a great value. I’m still using them, but will continue to search for the perfect fit.

Great value, comfortable.


Got these headphones on Amazon Prime Deal Day, I think I paid $25 or $30. What an awesome value. I use these for the gym. I spend about an hour and a half at the gym roughly 4 days a week. I usually charge the headphones once a week, just leaving them plugged into the outlet in my car. I really like these headphones. They are comfortable and natural feeling. I wish the bluetooth range was a little farther. I definitely can't cross the gym without losing connection. Also, when the battery does start to die it happens very fast. The voice will warn ""low battery"" and the headphones usually die by the next song, about 5 minutes. I wish the warning came when you had more like 30 minutes of use time left. The low battery signal is a little abrupt. All in all, great purchase, would definitely recommend.

The look good and feel good in my ears. The sound quality is pretty good as well. They came fully charged right out of the box. They paired easily to my iPhone, I love the foam ear tips that came with it. Plus it came with a car vent phone holder and a adhesive credit card holder.Update: I’ve noticed that I didn’t receive the car charger and cord.

Good for light duty, unsuitable for outdoor exercise.


These are great for around the house or maybe walking around on a day where the air is still. The sound quality is good, people said they could hear me clearly when I tested them inside.If you plan on running with these or the wind starts blowing while you are wearing these, you can forget about hearing anything. The wind noise is unbearable.If you just want something to use while doing housework, these are great. If you plan on using them for running, pass on these.

Great Battery Life, Sound, Comfort. Disappointing Durability.


I purchased these headphones on September 15th, 2017, mostly on the encouragement of the positive reviews posted.-The battery life is impressive, usually lasting me close to 8 hours on somewhat daily basis.-The sound is above average for a wide range of music, compared to say the typical OEM headphones included with most cell phone purchases.-The ear hook is malleable when manually adjusted, but otherwise firm and easily stays in place. When I wasn't using them at work, I would use them while running outside, or on the treadmill or elliptical, and they stayed in place quite comfortably.-The ear buds come in 3 sizes; small, medium, large.  They stay inside your ear quite snugly, without causing any discomfort.  This tight fit also helps to both reduce background noise, and boost the volume of the music being played through them.-Calls made with these headphones were below average, with almost all callers reporting very low voice output being heard on their side. After the first few calls, I would simply answer the phone, then immediately switch to speakerphone to continue the conversation.Now, to the main reason this product is being rated 3 stars.-Durability. These headphone simply do not last more than a few months. My original pair lasted 5 months, after which they would not turn on. Attempting to reset the headphones (connect power source, hold down power button 7 seconds, disconnect power source, turn on) did not fix the problem.After looking through the question and answer section for the product, I was reminded these headphones have a 1 year warranty. I contacted customer support via email, which replied very quickly with instructions on how to submit a warranty claim.  After providing the necessary information (amazon order number, contact info, address), I received a replacement pair in the mail 2 days later.In that regard, customer service is outstanding.Unfortunately, the replacement headphones also seemed to suffer from the same durability issue, as they only lasted 3 months. The problem this time was the headphones would still turn on, but would no longer accept a charge. I attempted to use several different cables and chargers, but to no avail.While I'm aware the original pair of headphones is still under warranty until September 2018, and thus I may still be eligible to receive another replacement, I simply don't want to go through the motions to receive what might be another short lived pair of headphones. I have a few trips planned for this summer where I will be taking my headphones for use during flights, for which I'd rather spend the time now to look for a suitable pair of headphones than cross my fingers and hope they don't die on me again.To recap, headphones have great battery life, above average sound, are very comfortable to wear, and stay in place quite well. Unfortunately, the durability of this product is significantly less than one would expect to have. Until this issue is resolved, I cannot recommend this headphones other than as a backup pair for when your good set of headphones is lost, or dies.

Best Headphones I've Ever Owned and Great Customer Service


I love these headphones. I've had them since April of last year and have had pretty much no issues with them.Recently, the left side of my headphones has become faulty and when i move the wire in a certain direction the sound cuts out. Thats likely a problem just caused by wear as with most headphones. I contacted Tekatron about the issue and since I still have a week under warranty they graciously sent me a pair of replacement headphones.Honestly I've owned Studio Beats and other headphones here and there but these are the best headphones I've ever owned. Comfortable, good sound. I like bass in my headphones and honestly with these headphones I never really noticed a bass issue. I just recognize that its just right for what I like. Battery life is great. I've been caught in the rain and actually tested out showering with them and had no issue. I didn't just let water fall on them though. Water splashed off in small amounts onto the headphones but they were fine. I'm sure drenching them in water would be a different story.Would definitely recommend these headphones for anyone. Affordable, great quality and a very responsive company. Replied within minutes on a Sunday. That deserves 5 stars on its own, haha.

Great value!


I love these headphones! They came with a full charge and I had them turned on all day today, using it just for phone calls, and they still have 80% charge. The sound quality is great. I can turn them up all the way with no distortion and they are loud enough I can't leave it up that high. Noise canceling works well and they aren't too hard on my ears. Overall the best headphones I've used to date. I didn't even realize the awesome lightning/micro USB came with it or the dual car charger with a 2.1 and 1 amp port! This is the best purchase I've made on amazon.

Easy to use. Good sound quality. Bass is decent. Not sound proof; you can hear wind. Battery life is decent. If used almost everyday, it needs charging every 2 days. Charges quickly too! Not a hassle to wear or use. Sticks to ear fine. Fits my ears fine too! This bluetooth earbuds, unlike most, doesnt flash red and blue LED's brightly and is not distracting to others. Quality doesnt feel cheap. Worth the buy if youre looking for decent bass, bluetooth, durable quality, easy to use, not so flashy, bluetooth head phonea. Sound quality is good too. Worth 30 something bucks.

Good sound, okay value, bad connection and wind noise.


Ordered these to replace my wired earbuds that I was using for running. I would describe the sound quality as pretty decent, but sometimes the device has a LOT of stuttering when listing to music. At least a couple times a song, it will ""buffer"" for half a second. This seems to improve the longer the connection has been established, and does not appear to be related to the location of the phone - for example, I get the stutter whether the phone is in my pocket, my hand, in the case or out of the case, or 15 feet away.The other negative aspect of these headphones is the wind noise. It's AWFUL. I have to wear a beanie when I run outside or the noise gets too annoying. These are loud headphones with decent music clarity, so you can usually turn up the volume in order to compensate, but you'll still here the wind noise no matter what you do.Overall, these are decent quality with good sound and stay on the ears well, but the stuttering (""buffering"") along with the wind noise knocks these down to a 3/5 star review. Decent purchase for the low price point, and work well in the gym, just not outside.

AVOID - Drops Bluetooth Connection


I bought these headphones hoping they would good for my variety of activities from house chores, running and trail riding (wearing a bike helmet). Unfortunately, these frequently drop the Bluetooth signal from my iPhone SE, which is a total failure for this product. What the user experiences is that the sound keeps dropping out when using these, which is enraging. I have rebooted my phone, ""forgotten"" and re-paired the Bluetooth device, but nothing helps. I hope the seller will take these back. They are either a defective unit or just lousy quality. Be warned.

I've had these earphones for almost a month now.  I use them everyday and shower with them on a regular basis and they're amazing.  The rubber that wraps around my ears took a little getting used to, just different than what I'm used to, not painful. The connect to my phone within 2 seconds of turning them on and the music is crisp, clear and loud.Update, I've had the ear phones for almost 6 months, using them sometimes 2-3 times a day to include the shower.  I'ma have to change the rating because for a little while now the earphones have been turning off / disconnecting from my phone with out notice.

Overall pretty bad.


I didn't expect much from these considering the price. I was hopeful that they are a good value, based on the positive revi. But I can't recommend these to anyone. First of all, the sound is terrible. It's muffled and has slight echo, like a cheap speaker in a cardboard box. Second, the built quality is suspect. My impression is that these won't last long. Also, I suspect the water proofing is exaggerated; if only because the charging port doesn't seal well. Third, the reception is not great. If put my phone in my pocket, the sound cuts out.

Look no further--these are awesome!


These were a Christmas gift for my son who originally asked for Beats wireless headphones. As everyone knows they are very expensive so I started doing some research. I came across this product and read many of the reviews. Since I don't use wireless earbuds I had no personal experience with any one company. Many of the reviewers had that experience and named several Brands I had heard of that were way more expensive and not as good as these. I decided to give it a go and purchased these. My son loves them. He uses them every day. He's taken them on long sports bus trips, gym workouts etc and they perform well. He just said it again last night--""I really like these wireless headphones. And they charge really fast too"". My husband has a pair that are way more expensive than these and I think he's on his fourth pair (getting exchanges thank goodness) because they don't hold up. This is a great product. And a really really great product for the price! Will definitely purchase again!

Very satisfied. Sound quality is great so far, no problem with figuring out the buttons (as long as you read the instructions.) I will say the flap cover for the micro-USB charging port on the headphones is rather flimsy and may eventually break off, but personally that doesn't bother me.The fit is great though, I have no problem with the buds staying in my ears, and the hooks add extra support--I've had issues with buds before.Of course, I've only owned them for about a week as of now, so time will tell if they hold up to my satisfaction.

I have only had headphones for a week, but so far the sound quality for listing to music is great.  They are very comfortable and come with a nice case for storage. As a bonus, the seller provides car charger and an extra charging cord that is compatibly with both Android & Apple connection (very nice touch).  Pairing was simple and adjusting volume on ear piece was easy.  The only reason for 4 star vs 5 is if you want to use as a primary headset for making phone calls, the sound for hearing caller is excellent but I was told by the caller on other end that the voice quality when I was talking was not as clear as speaking directly into the phone and sounded like I was using a speaker phone.  For the price, the great packaging and case with bonus cord, I would definitely recommend as an excellent buy.

They come with a charging cord for your ipod/iphone and a zippered case both which improve the satisfaction of this purchase.  I love the charging cord and the case.  The earphones are reliable and easy to use, and I have run them for three-fours  hours or so, they haven't run down yet.  I wish there were some way of telling how much charge is left.  The company is very responsive.  I had an issue with the first set, company refunded the purchase and I bought another set.  I would buy these again.

Give them a shot. Can’t get better workout headphones for the price.


These fit very comfortably over my ear and have a decent Bluetooth range on them. I hate having to carry my phone on me while I’m at the gym as I tend to get very distracted. For the price, the sound quality is better than expected honestly. I have a couple pairs of over ear Sony bass boosters that sound superb, but they are too bulky to work out in (and also cost well over $150 and I would hate to break them)- input these bad boys. Haven’t tried phone calls yet so no comment on that. They also included a magnet to attach my phone to the dash (kinda random, but nice) and a 3M wallet pocket to attach to the back of your phone case (again, very random, but it feels to be decent quality). I have a pop socket on the back of my phone so I can’t comment on the performance of either of those things.Very happy with the price:performance. Give them a shot.

I am enjoying my wireless headphones with my Iphone 7 Plus.


I took some time to provide feedback so that I could use the headset for a while. My need is simpler that most. I use the headset for the music while on air flights and to talk to my wife while she is driving home at night.  I have not used them during exercise.  The sound quality is quite good.  I can hear nice lows and good highs.  Since I am not as active as many users I don't have any issues with the unit breaking.  It fits my ears well and sound good.  When I am on the phone people on the other end say I am very clear.  The wireless connection to my iPhone 7 plus phone was simple.

My review on March 21: Sensor headphones deliver clear sound and are easy to use.  They are more than adequate for receiving and making phone calls.  I rate them a three because at their lowest setting the volume is way too loud.  I've adjusted my Samsung 7Edge volume and tuning and it is still way too loud.  UPDATE:  Senso Customer Service reached out to me and provided assistance to reset my headset.  The volume issue is resolved.  I am impressed with the quality, affordability of the headset and the excellent customer service.

They stay in the ears snugly, are light and have excellent sound. Love that a car charger and an extra lightnjng port is included--plus a good case.

The sound quality is great, and they've never made my ears sore; however, the mic was nothing to write home about. The sound quality was good enough for talking but definitely not great. We also occasionally experienced some sort of interference while on the phone/Skype. I continued to use them fairly often without issue, but my girlfriend rarely used her pair.More recently, I've been using them to listen to music while running on the treadmill. They don't give me any issue at paces over about 7:30 min/mi, but when I'm running faster than that, they will quickly slide out of my ears. My sister showed me a pair Beats that she uses when running, and the ear hooks are much more rigid on hers. Although I haven't tried, I imagine the Beats would stay in much better. The Sensos stay in just fine as long as it's low impact, but I imagine you would have issues if you tired to use these for high intensity workouts, such as Crossfit.If you are looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to wear around the house while listening to music, I don't think you can go wrong with these. I would give them five stars for music listening and four for Skyping/talking on the phone. Falling out during running is an issue for me though, and I am currently looking for a new pair that won't slide out.

Better mic quality than the iPhone 7 Plus onboard mic


I purchased these to use w: an iPhone 7 Plus. I've been happily using Apple's EarPods for a number of years, with a few Jabra BT headsets along the way for good measure. Invariably, I'll get a comment or two about the voice quality coming across my BT headset, freak out, and go back to the tried & true EarPods.Last week I bought these off a daily deal whim, and used them for the first time today.My wife, who is accustomed to the ""audio check"" game, said my voice sounded clearer over these SENSL's than on the standalone iPhone mic. So I tried them on a few customer calls, asking for feedback on two of them: same thing! No echo, no white noise or feedback, and, so far, 8 or 9 people have found them to be clearer than the iPhone 7's onboard mic!We'll see how they hold up, but for <$40, these are already more impressive than any Jabra I've had so far!Also, the little zipper pouch is slick. :)

Great for the price.


Great headphones for the price.  I use them when lifting weights and running - even in the rain, and that has caused no problems.They fit well, form a good seal, and do not readily fall out.  The ""noise-cancelling"" claim is dubious.  I don't think there is any actual noise cancellation going on, but the seal and the sound quality are fine anyway.I've never intentionally tested the Bluetooth range, but forgot my phone in the other room once.  I was about 20ft away and the sound was still crystal clear.The battery seems to last maybe 4-6 hours.  It warns you when the battery is low with a voice in your ear.  You best take that voice seriously, because you get the notification three times in about a minute before they power off.I like these headphones and would recommend them.

I love these headphones.


These SENSO bluetooth head phones provide excellent sound.They are easy to use and I use them to listen to music streaming through my android phone. You have to be close to your device but not right on top of it but my phone is usually in my pocket.However in my small apartment I can really put the phone anywhere and the headphone pick up perfectly. The battery lasts quite a while and recharges quickly via a small usb cable. Very good product.

Serious usability issues.


Pros:-Audio quality is pretty good. Decent bass/mids/highs, but the bass is really only there when the ear buds are in there securely... more on that later.Cons:-The over the ear hooks do absolutely nothing. They're way too big so they hover above my ear when the buds are in place.  Also they're made of really floppy rubbery material, so I doubt they'd do much to hold them securely if the were touching my ears.-On a similar note, they don't stay in my ears. I tried all the different tips and they would just slide out after a second even when I was just sitting still at my desk. I returned them before actually using them for running, since they wouldn't stay in my ears while not moving.-So the audio quality is pretty good when listening to music... for the most part. During silence there is a soft hissing sound which is pretty annoying, but becomes super annoying when listening to audiobooks/podcasts since it's always noticeable.  If you're just listening to music the audio sounds pretty good.

The quality of the music is good enough if you’re using it only for working out


The quality of the music is good enough if you’re using it only for working out. I would not use these as your main headset. They begin to hurt if worn for more than 2 hours, and the wire that connects the two ear pieces is freakishly long. I cannot run with them as they flap around and disrupt the music. Basically you’d hear this “rubbing” or thudding sound as the wire hits your back. I have since got a hair tie that I used to knot the long wire and it isn’t so bothersome. Battery length is dependable.

Great wireless earbuds at an amazing price!


I purchased this product to replace a pair of Powerbeats 2 wireless that broke.  The SENSO headphones are just as good if not better than the Powerbeats.  They connect quickly to my phone, the controls are easy to use, and the sound is great.  The mic works well for phone calls, family has said they cannot tell I am using the headphones instead of my actual phone.  Overall great product and good customer service.  I am going to purchase another pair for a friend.Update:  Have now bought multiple pairs as gifts.  Family and friends love them!  These are great headphones at an amazing price.

Great headphones but stopped working after 2 months-Update


I bought these headphones two months ago and I instantly fell in love with them.  They are great for working out and help to cancel out any outside noise.  I would use them everyday whether for work or for exercise.  Suddenly this past Friday my headphones wouldn't come on.  I thought maybe the battery died so I tried charging it but it still would not come on.  It sucks because this truly is a great product I just received a defective product.- Update to my previous post.  I contacted Senso and let them know of my problem.  They provided me with a solution to try to get my heaphones working again.  When that didn't work since it has not been a year since I purchased the headphones they agreed to send me another set. Just received my secondf set of headphones and I am ecstatic to use them again

bit disappointed


I wanted to like these headphones when i got them cause my brother-in-law said he had them for 2 years and they worked great. When I first got them the audio would cut in and out everytime i turned them on for a couole seconds. This made me think that the headphones were deffective but this eventually stop so i ignored it. About 1.5 months in and the headphones no longer charge. Its a shame because the sound quality was nice and they were comfy, but they feel cheap and didnt last at all.

Exactly what I needed


The headphones are an excellent purchase. The accessories that come with them are more than I expected and are very useful.  I have always had a trouble with in the ear earbuds as they keep falling out and this soft over the ear how old are keeps them in place perfectly.  When I charged them up and turned them on,  the Bluetooth showed up immediately  on my iPhone and my iPad and with one press on the screen they were paired.  I did not find that the bass was overbearing or dominant at all in my set,  but I do  favor acoustic music.

... two headsets to try for my workouts as I hated my last ones


I bought two headsets to try for my workouts as I hated my last ones.  I failed to realize this pair doesn't have the mic to use for talking, too.  The headset is fine and seems to hold a charge for a super long time, which I appreciate!  But a bummer that I can't use for a regular headset, too.  My recommendation is keep shopping for a different option.  I'm keeping this as I've used them a few times but there are options for similar price that would give you a mic, too.  My bad for not reading the description more closely.

Great product for a great price


I use this product for weight training, ultramarathon training, driving,  and while at work.  I have used for almost a year now and still amazing.  It's easy to use, charge and doesn't fall of whole running.  I love that they give a lot of extra silicone plugsfor the ear. It came with a pouch and they threw in a card holder for my cellphone.  My only problem is the range is not the greatest.  If I take 3-5 steps away from it at the gym I lose signal. I didn't knock them for it on my rating because for the price you can't beat it.

Too many issues to ignore.


I tried these out for a month before returning them. Since first turning them on, I've heard this high-pitched whining sound in the left earbud, outside of the normal humming noise it makes when it's on and active. I thought I could ignore it, but it was just too distracting. Every pause in a song or every time they were connected and an app was opened, I would hear the whining in the background.That being said, the pros and cons were as follows:Pros:- Sound quality was actually pretty good when it wasn't too quiet.- The range was quite good, like 10-15 feet in the same room before it started breaking up.- The ambient noise dampening was pretty good, the earbuds did well to seal outside noise from getting in.- The ear-hooks were really convenient if I only wanted to have one side plugged in, I could just wrap the wire around my neck and hook earpiece on the other end. No off-balance feeling, and no bouncing around. The ear-hooks could also hook to one another when not in use.Cons:- Design-wise, the power/pause button is in an uncomfortable location, just on the other side of the right earbud. Every time you power it on/off or pause you're essentially pushing the earpiece into your ear if you tend to use one finger to push the button. Otherwise, you're holding the whole right earpiece, which isn't really convenient if you have to turn it off quickly when someone comes up to you at work.- Ear-hooks are terrible for a person with glasses. There just isn't enough room back behind the ears.

I must add that these are the best earbuds I've ever used


I have had these earbuds for almost 2 months. I use them when I work out for about 10 hours per week. I am just barely having to charge them for the first time. The charging cable would not charge the earbuds, and no indicator light would go on on the earbuds. I tried other charging cables that I have, to no avail. I called Invotek, and was met with professionalism and apologies. I was offered a new set of earbuds, to be here in 5-7 business days. I must add that these are the best earbuds I've ever used! They have a great, clear sound with great noise cancellation.

Horrible Customer Service


First set lasted only 3 months. Manufacturer replaced these. Second set lasted almost 9 months. Manufacturer refused to replace unit or help fix the issue due to the fact that I contacted them 10 days past original purchase date warranty period. The issues with the second pair started before the warranty ended, I just never had the time to message them. Figured since it was just a few days past, they would still help me out. Guess not. They offered me a 5% coupon instead which I felt like a slap in the face since it would only save me about a $1.25. They also take long to respond back to messages. Save yourself some time and buy a high quality pair like I am going to do now.

Out of the box, these are better than my wife's Powerbeats 2 Wireless which were 3x more expensive when we purchased those.  Haven't tested the  8 hour battery life yet, but they have handled my 2 hour gym routine twice and a couple 20 min dog walks on a single charge thus far.  The sound quality isn't studio headphone quality, but I also stream music through Spotify, Amazon and Pandora so hard to say if it's the headphones fault.  And honestly, that isn't why you buy wireless headphones.  Bottom line, these come with different ear pieces for all size ears and they are great for the gym!  I will update this review if I come across any issues but thus far, I would buy these again!July 2019 - I did buy them again.  Lost mine at the gym.  These things are pretty much unbeatable for the price.

Do not purchase these headphones


I strongly recommend that you do not purchase these headphones. I have purchased them several times in the past. They consistently performed well. However, I recently received two orders of the headphones. Both headphones have problems with the audio cutting out, even at very short distances from the Bluetooth receivers. There are other differences from the older Senso headphones that lead me to believe that they changed the hardware. Also, their customer support is poor. Do not waste your time buying this product.

Nice for the money; somewhat ""floppy"" ear wrap


Very nice for the money; good sound, great accessories.  Suggest staying within 20 feet of device. There are tons of options in wireless headsets, think I chose a good one for price and overall quality. One somewhat slight critique is that the ear wraps are a bit floppy making them hard to get on your ear with one hand. The softness is probably good for longer wear but as someone who takes them off after use it's a bit annoying in putting them back on. Perhaps a slightly more firm rubber would be better. Otherwise I like them.

Great Product for the Price!


I needed some Bluetooth headphones for the gym, as I kept getting all tangled with my wired headphones while exercising. I didn't want to spend a fortune on something that was going to be used during active activity, so I saw these on the top of the list and the price was definitely well within my budget. I received them and was surprised at the sound quality and especially the bass that came through in comparison to my iPhone headphones. The noise cancellation is great, as well, as I definitely have to pause my music if anyone is trying to speak to me. It's Bluetooth connection is strong, too - I can walk across the gym to pick up a weight and leave my phone at the equipment I'm using and there is no break in connection! The battery life is pretty decent, as well, but it doesn't give you much warning once they're running low. It's not joking around with you when it says ""Battery Low""! Regardless, I highly recommend this product if you need something that is inexpensive but of good quality.

Sound is great BUT.......


I use these primarily when I mow my lawn.  I keep my phone in my pocket so that I have ready access to my music or if someone should call.  If I turn my head to the right I lose Bluetooth connection and if I turn my head to the left I lose Bluetooth connection.  So basically the distance from the sending source is critical.  If my phone is right next to the headphones it's flawless.  More than 3 feet away and it disconnects.

Great Value.  Works well.


For the price as compared to the big name brands, these are wonderful.  Easy to charge, comes with a wonderfully thought out set of accessories to be able to carry and charge.  I'd been warned by the owner of one of the expensive brands not to overcharge the headphone (who watches that carefully) because they could burn out.  I've never had a problem with these.  Plug them in, leave them until you need them and they are ready to go.  Easy to pair.  On-device controls are easy to use.  A great value.  Comfortable to wear.  Use it at the gym, in the car, around the house.

This product is pretty awesome. With everything it comes with its unbeatable for its price. Another great thing oh get with this product is the customer service. I have already had to represent ice reach out to me and make sure that the product was what I wanted and to see if there was anything else I would need. The pair is pretty easy. It sounds good and it's pretty stylish. I like how they fit into your ears for security and then on top of that they have another part to go over your ears. There is no volume box on the cord like many other which is awesome and less distracting.The only cons I have is that the part that goes around your ear is a little flimsy for me and when I first tried tried them it seemed like one side was louder than the other but have used a few times now and they seem to be fine but if there is a consistent problem k know the Senso company will help me become a fully satisfied company. These are the best Bluetooth headphones you can get for the price that has everything. Definitely telling other about this product.

Work great...until they don't!


I've had two sets of the Senso Bluetooth Headphones and unfortunately both have had the same issue in the total span of six months. After using them for a few months, the audio in the right ear bud begins to drop out. After having used two separate sets of ear buds, and having this same problem, it appears to me that it’s not just a random issue. I was using them on almost a daily basis. But this was just around the house and they weren't abused or used incorrectly. It’s especially a problem since I'm unable to hear in my right ear. Therefore, the ear buds are deemed worthless. Up until the issue arises, they work well, which is why I still gave this two stars instead of just one. They have nice audio quality, strong battery life, and fit well. I had hoped my problem with the first set of headphones was just a fluke, so I was disappointed when I faced the same problem with the second.

So so


The earpiece is somewhat uncomfortable for me because it tangles with my curly hair but otherwise fine, it does adjust properly to the ear and does not hurt. I don't think they will fall out while exercising (I bought these for work and haven't used them while moving much) and sound is clear for me BUT the mic does NOT work and I need to take them of (and untangle from my hair) to make/take calls because people can't hear me instead of just switching between calls and music.

I was really excited by the reviews and price discount, but that didn't last long.Positives:The headphones fit snugly, cancel out a lot of noise, and have excellent bass.Negatives:The sound quality is lower than expected. These headphones sound different than all of my other headphones, and not in a good way. The sound isn't very clear, almost muffled. I also have had constant connectivity issues when I connect to my iPhone. The headphones will emit a beeping noise every 30 seconds or so and cause my audio to pause. It's very strange because if I disconnect and ""forget"" the headphones from my phone and then reconnect, they work fine. However, this is very inconvenient to do every time I want to use them with my phone. I have also noticed the wind noise that other commenters have mentioned.I had high hopes for these, but I will probably return them soon.

If you buy 1, buy 2 - So you're never without


First and foremost I listen to music, in general, a lot.  Additionally, I normally work out pretty regularly and have had numerous pairs of headphones over the years die from when I sweat and the headphones would get ""wet"".  The best way I can describe these headphones is this, have you ever bought a pair of shoes or jeans that were so comfortable you bought a 2nd?  Just in case of the off chance you weren't able to find them again?  That's how I've been with headphones for a long time, but with these I'm going to buy at least one more pair, if not two just to be safe.  Phenomenal sound quality.  Sound just as good, if not better since they're cheaper, than Beats Solo2, IMO.

Okay if you don't care about sound quality.


I bought this item to replace another brand that would not stay in while I was working out. The Senso definitely stayed in my ears with no issues. The packaging and accessories were great. Came with a carrying case, and both mac (lightning) and mini-usb charger. It was easy to connect via Bluetooth to my iPhone 7 plus.With that being said the sound quality is terrible and that is why I am taking away 2 stars. I almost went with 2 stars but it does do its job. The sound I would describe as muffled and almost sounds like a recording made in 1920 or on AM stations. I am not an audiophile and have bought many inexpensive speakers and headphones with no complaints. This one though takes the cake. If the sound quality improved this would easily be a 5 star item.

Worked great


They worked well and I thought the battery life was great but I don't think the battery level alert works well on my pair. I checked them before a workout and it showed it was almost fully charged but then halfway through my workout, it said low battery and then died. That was a little annoying but I figured I could work around that and just charge it more often. Then yesterday, it just randomly would stop connecting. I would be in the middle of a song and it would disconnect and I had trouble reconnecting it. I tried turning them off and then back on but it took forever to even turn them off. I restarted my phone as well. It finally reconnected and lasted about 45 seconds before it disconnected again and I just couldn't be bothered to do the whole process again. I've had these a month and definitely do not recommend buying. Yes, they were a good price but they should last longer than 1 month.

good price and easy to use


for the price, these are really good. However, the over the ear things don't really touch my hear/head at all... actually I'm not sure why they're there... Also this might sound weird but they don't go very quiet. I work in a very quiet office and I'm worried people can hear my music, on my iphone I can turn the volume down to 2 and it's still pretty loud, but below that they make a beep sound and then stop playing. They are a lot more comfortable than other headphones I've tried and you don't have to force them into your ears like others. Easy to use.

If you have problems getting earplugs to stay in your ears - don't buy these because the work the same way


The earpieces, even though it comes with several adjustable sizes, none of them with fit and stay in my ears. And when it took the headphones out running - which is why I bought them - this became an even bigger problem. Also the over-ear piece, which is flexible and soft, which I appreciated at first, having had running headphones in the past where the over-ear piece is so unforgiving that it leaves a mark - but it was so limp that coupled with the earpieces not fitting in my ears, the whole headset was loose to the point of falling off my head.The sound quality, noise cancelling, and call/mic quality were all great though. Just not a good fit for me.

Better Than My $200 Headphones


I was skeptical but these headphones were recommended on a daily blog I read and now I am sold. I row 30 minutes almost everyday at the gym and these headphones stay in place no matter how much I sweat (which is a lot). I also workout on the heavy bag and my $200 headphones used to fall out of my ears but these SENSO headphones stay on through the punching and sweating of 8 rounds. I am putting them on my wish list for Xmas and my order another pair on my own so I can have one for the gym, one for my purse and one at work. The best!

Reading through these reviews its amazing how the same technology works differently for different people,the first set of hear buds I bought never worked right out of the box and they were around 60 bucks so I was reluctant to try again but figured I would go with the cheaper ones,they work fine but in order to not have any skips or drop outs I practically have to have the device strapped to my forhead,if I hold it directly in front of me its fine but if I put it in my pocket the skips and drop outs start,so it seems to me this technology has a ways to go yet.....the distance issue is sketchy as well and I find the issue goes away if I'm indoors,as if the signal is diluted somehow outside with no walls bounderies....overall good.

Decent but with a design flaw


I've had these headphones for awhile now, and I'm still using them. They are adequate for the price. Good enough sound quality, decent battery life, though for my uses it could be longer. I've worn them in the rain and I work around boats where I'm constantly getting splashed, and the water hasn't damaged them, which is important.However, because I use them fairly frequently I like to carry them in my pocket. They have an annoying design flaw for this purpose, which is that the power button sticks out from the earbud in a way that is extremely easy to press. Many times I've pulled them out of my bag or pocket to find that they are already on. A couple times I've found out when I check my phone and notice my bluetooth is connected. Once or twice, I even pulled them out to find out they had drained themselves dead after they turned themselves on and began playing my last spotify playlist on their own.I've had these for a year and they've seen good use, so again they are decent headphones. But the design flaw of the button currently has me searching for a new pair - I've just had them drain their own battery and leave me without headphones one too many times.

A very good purchase!


These are great earphones and not because they are bluetooth, well at least in part.  They actually have great range and clarity due to upgraded tech. They are not noise isolating but they do stay in your ear/ear hole and sound good with my electronic (EDM) music when at work or the gym.  The added carry case, car charger (dual port), usb cord with a flip able, inter usable, lightning adapter/usb c(?) adapter + different size earpods is what I call more ""BANG!"" for my buck.  Fast shipping and I can definitely recommend the Seller Invotek.  Thanks!*** Update 7-4 ***Sadly my earphones started not working on the left side. Can't be sure why since I use them in a light duty way. Invotek (seller) was very responsive to my email and ended up sending me a new pair rather quickly. Outstanding customer service! I do hope these last much longer. I also received foam tips in this package (upgrade?). Still pleased...

Doesn't work when actually working out


Had these actually been $37 headphones I probably would have given them a 4 star rating, but they're not. They're billed as $170 headphones that are on sale, so that's how I'll rate them.When I use them at the office, the sound quality is stellar. Feedback on the controls is almost instantaneous. It's when I use them to workout (you know, what they're advertised for?) is when I start to have problems. Even just a light walk with the dogs is enough for the connection to crap out. I've turned the phone on airplane mode with just Bluetooth, same issue. I've tried it on my ipod that's just WiFi enabled, same issue. I can only catch about every 3rd word of a spng before the connection cuts out. Worthless and annoying. As soon as the device that these headphones are trying to connect to is on the move, they can't keep up. And this is when it's in my pocket! 30 foot radius doesn't help when it can't stay connected 3 feet away.$170 headphones should be miles better than this, I'm just lucky I got them on sale and didn't pay full price.

I listen to audio books on my phone, in my car whenever or wherever. My nephew gave me and my husband these wireless buds. We both love them. No wires and quality is great. My husband just purchased another set as he very often forgets to charge his. Excellent quality I recommend mend to everyone.

They sound really good but seem to have trouble keeping them in my ear.  I changed the size and it seems to fit better but still seem to be fiddling with them for awhile until they get right.  The cord that connects both of the ear pieces is a little long but its nice so you don't lose them.  They ear covers are flimsy but they do help to keep them in your ears.  I've given them a 4 star rating because they sound great (decent bass), you can get about 20ft away from your phone before they start to get staticy, the battery life is AMAZING.  I've literally been using them for hours every day and still haven't needed to charge them (i've had them for about a week).  ALSO love that you get a phone charger w/car adapter to charge them. They are easy to pair and overall a great set of Bluetooth headphones.

Best Buds I've Tried & a Great Company.


good fit, stable and easy to work.  mic quality is very good, clear and responsive.  sound quality is decent, good bass response and mids are very strong. the highs are a little on the low end to my taste and at higher volumes music can sound a little muddy.  movies and phone calls the sound is very good and clear.  the ear hooks keep the buds in place very well without causing discomfort or fatigue and i can even wear my favorite sunglasses and i have very close earlobes.  if my phone or if the headphones had a means of a graphic equalizer to adjust the tone balances these would be the perfect purchase in my opinion (again, for music sound and quality and i am very picky about that) and you simply cannot beat the price for the quality.  a very good product and the company is thoughtful from build to components all the way to accessories.  thank you for a good product and best of luck with your company.  i'm looking forward to your other items in the future.

These headphones are a replacement for my Dre beats headset I currently own. In comparisons, Senseo sound, design and quality are comprable to Dre Beats in every way. I also like the buttons functions that are on the actual earpiece and not on the connecting wire as on the Dre beats. Save yourself about $130 and DONT waste your time and money with Dre Beats set, all I had with them was alit of problems with my 4 replacement headsets sent to me over the coursee of 1.5 years with Apple. ALL BUT ONE that they sent back were refurbished ones and quickly stoppoed working right after about 3 months. Hopefully, Senseo stands the test of time better than my DRE BEATS did for me. ENJOYING THIS HEADSET so far.

Good headphones for the price.


Surprisingly for the price, these are actually decent headphones. We purchased two sets when they were on sale. The headphone battery lasts a good amount of time without charging. Comes with a carport charger. The only issue I have it sometimes when linking the headphones to my iPhone I have to ""forget the device"" and redo the link for some reason. Not a huge issue but people have had issues with it not linking automatically but we figured out the way to fix it when it does that. Sound is pretty decent too

Amazing sound, competitive battery life.


I've had these headphones for over a year now and I'm incredibly pleased. I feel the battery life (about 6-8 hours) is comparable to any other similar product. The sound is actually really good. These headphones don't have the tinny sound that other similar products have had. The bass is clear and deep. Honestly, I wouldn't probably spend $150 for other brands when you can get a really amazing product for this price.Cons: they require adjustment every 15-30 minutes if you want them to sit just right. No fast charge option. The wire does get caught on my shirt and tug at the headphones occasionally.Pros: incredible sound, no ear fatigue (I can wear these for about two hours with little to no pain in my ears you can sometimes get), and great battery life for the price.

Excellent


I purchased these less than a week ago for use on the treadmill at the gym, and for listening to podcasts in bed without disturbing my wife. Otherwise we have Bluetooth available on all of our audio systems.  I'm not a big cell phone user, so that's not so important to me.Overall, I'm very impressed so far.  The sound is very good.  My only complaints:1 - I've had some problems with ""stutter"" on startup occasionally. Sometimes I've had to power off and on again to clear it.2 - At night the LED flash reflection is very visible off the wall.3 - It's not comfortable on my side in bed, but that's going to be true for anything that sticks out of the ear.

Where to start. Ordered and received in less than 36 hours. Upon delivery opened packaging, read instructions, charged, (using supplied USB cable) attached to my PC and then used headphones for a 50 minute workout.  Great sound quality and user friendly design!  Also, Senso includes a dual USB port car charger, small storage case and extra earbuds.  Tekatron CS department even emailed their direct information if problems arise.  Hopefully all goes well, for l am very pleased and look forward to purchasing many more for family members.

Wouldn't stay connected


These got returned. They looked great, were comfortable and came with a wide range of accessories. My biggest complaint, and deal breaker, was that they wouldn't stay connected. I either had my phone in a string bag on my back or in an armband case. Either way, it was never more than a couple feet away from the headphones. I'd be out walking the dogs and they'd constantly be cutting out. I tried to put up with it and gave them a full week to grow on me before I had had it. It was dissapointing

So, I then bought another pair andafter a month, the charging port is falling apart, and I am having a hard time charging them. Beside the faulty charging port, I just love them to death.

High Expectations, Left w/ Mixed Feelings, NOT for Running Outside


PROS (3) / CONS (4) listed below – PLEASE read if you’re thinking about purchasing the SENSOs vs. a higher-end brand such as Bose…  I needed to replace a pair of Bose wired headphones, while also moving into the wireless/Bluetooth technology.  After hours of online research, I opted to purchase SENSO’s wireless headphones, vs. Bose’s SoundSport headphones based on 1) Amazon customer reviews and 2) price.  However, don’t also be fooled.  I’ve since returned the SENSOs and purchased Bose’s SoundSport – right move.[PROS: 3]1)  Price: At $40, best budget-friendly and sturdy pair of Bluetooth wireless headphones available – but just remember that you’re getting what you pay for…2)  Ergonomics: The control buttons are intuitive and the power-up/down voice prompt is pleasant.3)  Accessories: Clever and well-designed 3-foot charging cable, that allows you to charge either your iPhone or the SENSO, without having to switch wall adapters.  Other items such as the sturdy case and various charging adapters make the SENSO a good value.[CONS: 4]1)  Sound Quality:  Powerful bass, but mid/treble sounds lack clarity.  Your favorite artists sound like they are performing in a bathroom/long hallway.  As a music enthusiast, this is not ideal.  However, if SENSO introduces an Equalizer app etc. to adjust/fix the sound distortion – could be a game changer.2)  Ambient Noise:  One caveat, I live in NYC so this actually matters.  Although silicone ear tips fit well, ambient noise is very noticeable.  Even while using the SESNSOs in the gym, there was an unpleasant amount of background noise.  I suddenly became aware of sounds created by other patrons, that I had never noticed while using my Bose.  Which leaves one option – turning up the SENSO’s volume to an otherwise uncomfortable level to block out/compete with the noise around you.3)  RUNNERS – please note.  The large earphone design is NOT aerodynamic and protrudes from your ears.  Which resulted in an unacceptable level of wind noise while running outside, even with little to no breeze.  In addition, the size/weight of the earpieces causes them to shift frequently while running – not fun making constant adjustments during a 4+ mile run.4)  Low Battery Prompt:  Audio prompts begin at ~20%, and then repeat EVERY 2-3 minutes.  Final moments with your music are basically ruined by the repetitive voice prompts.  Kind of like that random cell phone that keeps ringing during a movie – irritating.

A+ Sound, A- Inner Noise Reduction, C-  Outer Noise reduction, and MIGHT fall out if moving around.


I bought these because my other pair was started to only work if it was plugged in and so far i haven't have any serious issues with it. 2 things that i found out early on about these were, 1 The plastic parts supposed to keep it connected to your ear are either flimsy or to loose which defeats the purpose. The other is that though I couldn't hear outside noises while listening my other set also had great noise reduction outside the headphones so no one could hear, these on the other hand are a one way noise reduction streak, people can hear it outside of yourself.The pluses are that the sound quality i believe is not only louder but better than my other ones. I haven't had them long enough to know if they'll keep up but hopefully they will.Would i recommend this? Like i said it's a time based decision but for now i'd say if you need some and don't run marathons for them to possibly fall out then it's a good buy. Their Customer Service is almost instantaneous and there's a 1 year warranty so there's that. That's all I got for now, maybe i'll update this later, for now 4/5 rating.

Great value


Needed a new pair of headphones recently and decided to upgrade to wireless. It's been quite nice so far. Sound quality is great for the price, they're comfortable and worked for a while out of the box without a need to charge them right away. They're easy to set up and use. If I could change one thing about them, it would be moving the main button to another location on the unit. Pushing the button sometimes causes the earbud to press inward uncomfortably if one is trying to do something like pause the music or turn the headphones off before removing the right side speaker.

Excellent, especially for the price


Excellent, especially for the price.  This is my second pair of these headphones (I lost the first) and my fifth pair of bluetooth headphones.  These are my favorites so far.  I was a little skeptical at first with having the battery and everything on the earpiece, the previous headphones it was spliced into the wire between the two earpieces.  But after trying it out that doesn't bother me at all.These are very comfortable for me and fit into my ears well.  I'm very impressed with the battery, they seem to actually last about as long a promised (most I've had lasted half as long or less than promised after about a week).  They are also pretty good about not draining the battery when they are on but I'm not playing any audio.  The sound quality is pretty solid compared to the others I've had.  They seem to be built fairly durable and the water resistance is nice, I don't dip them in water but they are bound to get a little wet from time to time.These also come with what looks to be a very nice charging cable and a good usb adapter car plug, which is a nice surprise when so many of the electronics I purchase these days come with cheaply made cord that doesn't last.

Great Headphones, Terrible Support


I am writing this hoping that the Senso people read it and know how bad and shady their customer service is. The headphones themselves are actually great, they work very well for the price, fit in the ear well, come with bunch of extra stuff. I am a fan of the headphones themselves. However, being that they're 30 bucks, they're not invincible. Mine stopped working properly after about 11 months of use. I though ""oh great there is a 1 year warranty on them, I should be fine"" I filed a warranty claim with Senso and got an email response quickly asking for my amazon order number so they could verify the purchase, I responded and gave it to them as instructed. After that I heard NOTHING. After multiple follow up emails requesting help I still have not received a response telling me what I am supposed to do to finalize the claim. Because of their lack of response, I am now past the 1 year warranty and am stuck with broken headphones. Senso conveniently just stopped responding to me when they saw that my headphones were almost a year old. SHADY.... SHAAAAAAADY! Good headphones but bad support.

Bottom line, they are entry level headphones but they get the job done.  I bought them to connect to my new Apple Watch b/c I hate running with my phone but didn't want to spend $150 on headphones.  The sound quality is everything you could ever need on a run.  The noise cancellation is above average.  I also sweat like a pig but still had no issues with them staying in my ear.About 8 months into owning them and using them several times per week for runs one of the earbuds cut out and wouldn't turn back on.  I suspect the sweat finally got to them, but I don't know.  Much to my surprise Senso's customer service was actually spectacular.  I sent them an email through their website, they responded in minutes, and b/c my earphones were within the 12-month warranty they sent me a new pair free of charge.Bottom line- if you're worried about durability with a cheap product you should be.  But they have the warranty, so you can't lose with these headphones.

Don't buy these expecting any decent BT capabilities


Not being either at the cutting edge or bleeding edge of Tech, I don't go run out buying the latest & greatest just to keep up with the Jones'.Music is very therapeutic to me, so I purchased these for the HD sound quality primarily. The hands free call capability was secondary and more a 'perk'.Bottom line;Sound quality is wonderful and I am very pleased.Bluetooth hands free is at the complete opposite end of spectrum. Absolutely no 'good way' to wear these to make BT calling functional. MIC is placed in the absolute  worst spot and nothing you can do to improve it. As a male, I have a deep voice that carries well and doesn't benefit me one bit in regards to the MIC placement for BT hands free calling.Buy these for the exceptional sounding  music.Buy something else if BT hands free calling is also as important as the HD music quality.

Surprisingly great for the price and, even more surprisingly they're pretty darn good compared to some of the other high priced ones.*****BARE IN MIND***** For whatever reason the playback quality of the audio that informs you of what settings your device is at/what buttons you are clicking is AWFUL and if you only go by that and never try your music on it, you may think that you bought a piece of junk! But, again, that's just the audio quality for that operation and it is not a reflection of the audio quality of the actual headphones themselves.

Worked great briefly, then broke.


These worked great the first few times I used them. I was using them the other day during a run - took one side out briefly to do a safety check of my surroundings. When I put that side back in - it had snapped apart and the volume control fell out. I tried to snap it back together - but it is broken.  These didn't fall, I don't have super human strength - they were resting on my top - nothing to break them - so just a faulty design.  I used these maybe 10 times before this happened.

I've now used it for 3 months, and it doesn't charge consistently anymore. I have to wiggle the charging cable to get it right, maybe one out of ten times to see the red light. I thought it was the charging adapter so I tried both the long and short cables to charge but I got the same result, meaning it's the headphones. I use the earphone exclusively for the gym and I only used it 1-3 times a week since the purchase three months ago. But the return window has closed so I'm now stuck with it.

Excellent headphones for the price


I use these all the time to listen to podcasts, hockey games, and even music. On the bus, at work, at the gym, and at home- connection is solid and strong, charge life is decent, and sound quality is great for the price. I did have to tweak some of the equalization on my phone as there isn’t a ton of low end, but adjusting the EQ helped with that a little. You can hear things around them at lower volumes, but it’s not a huge issue and could probably be solved by swapping ear pieces in the kit or turning them up. Carrying case is sturdy but will occasionally turn the power on if it gets pressed in my backpack.  Overall, great headphones that I use all the time and don’t feel bad about them getting a little dirty, shoved in my backpack, or beat up.

They still work.I went and bought a pair for my grandfather to use because he knew how much I liked the ones I had; but upon receipt found the quality of the headphones to have significantly decreased. The over the ear arm that would hold on your ear would not hold in place enough for running like they used to. And above all the headphones would not connect to anything. With some playing around I somehow managed to mess up the bluetooth connectivity to my original pair of headphones and can no longer pair them. Was a very satisfied customer that raved about these headphones but due to the recent change in quality will tell you to save your money and invest in a better set! Please change back to your original quality senso!!

Good overall impression, but a few design weaknesses


The sound is excellent, the build is solid, the range of commands available on the headset very good. The overall impression after a few days is quite positive. Only issues: the earbuds occasionally get tangled. And when I use the earbuds on my bike, the wind creates vortices around the earbuds, partly drowning out the sound of what I am listening to. It is not as bad as with other earbuds, but definitely an issue. Both these flaws could perhaps be fixed by somehow streamlining the shape of the headphones

Doesn’t Pair With Bluetooth Devices


Won’t sync with either my IPad or Iphone. Wrote to manufacturer and asked for help.  In response they sent the manual. I’m past the return date so I guess I just have to eat the loss. Wish they had been more helpful.UPDATEAlthough the seller couldn’t solve the problem, he did refer me to the manufacturer.  They explained that after a reset you have to delete the earbuds from your device in settings so that they can be recognized.  I did this and they now work great. I’m a happy customer.

AMAZING SOUND


I have always had problems with earbuds staying in place. Imagine Dumbo and Yoda having child, those are my ears.When using the memory foam buds these don't budge, whether I'm lifting, running it doesn't matter they stay in place. And the sound is FANTASTIC. They cancel so much noise I have to warn my spouse I'm wearing them so she doesn't sneak up behind me and give me a heart attack. I like the sound so much I re-watch old action movies I've already seen on my phone with these headphones because the sound is so dynamic it actually makes the movie more enjoyable. Highly recommend.

I really wanted to like these!!


First the good. The packaging and items included with this set is exceptional. Everything showed up exactly as described, and I was surprised at the quality ""feel"" of the pair. However, this first set was not working correctly. I tried them every day for about a month during my workout routine and they were constantly dropping signal - cutting in and out. I emailed customer support and was promptly sent a brand new set.This second set arrived and worked flawlessly. The sound quality was superb, especially given the very reasonable price point for the product.  The microphone was clear (according the people on the other end of my calls).  I had no issues with sweat during workouts, and the buds stayed nicely in place. I was thrilled!!However, after using them nearly daily for about three months, I unfortunately experienced what many other reviewers have - the set just stopped working. No rhyme or reason, no slow fade-out in quality, just dead. I took very good care of the pair, never left them on the charger once fully charged, and did not abuse them.  However, they died anyway.  After two pairs, I unfortunately need to move on to another manufacturer.

Small Earbuds - Big Value


Living in a snow belt, I spend a lot of time outside to remove the snow from my driveway, sidewalk and roof.  I use my iPod with the corded earbuds, which I have to thread through my coat with the iPod in my jean's pocket.  At some point, I usually inadvertently snag the cord and have to stop and put it all together again.  Well never again!  The iPod is still in my pocket, but no cord connected to it, and the music sounds phenomenal! The price is real value and it was a snap to pair it with my Bluetooth devices - and I'm not tech savvy.  It's almost a pleasure to go out and shovel - almost😉.

Uncomfortable, bad fit and they feel awkward


The good thing is the sound quality.But the bad outweigh the good. Even with the smallest earpieces, the design doesn't allow them to stay on your ears. the hook is bendable to hold them on place, but it is till to large and doesn't keep them secure. they constantly fall out. When the are n, they feel awkward and uncomfortable.You may not pair them to more than 1 device.

Issues with Bluetooth connection; not ideal for outdoors or sports


I am continually having issues with the bluetooth connection.  These are not ideal for outdoor or sports activity.  If there's any wind, the connection gets broken and jumpy.  Or if I'm sweating, I have found the connection to be impacted too (despite is saying it's sweatproof).  I wear my phone in an arm band, so the signal doesn't have far to go, and I've used my phone successfully with other bluetooth headphones- so it makes me deduce the issue is the headphones.  There is nothing worse than being in the middle of a great run, for your music to be start jumping, skipping and going in and out.  Once it starts skipping, the connection does not recover or reconnect.

These are the BEST earphones for the money


I love these earphones! I started looking at wireless earphones when I began training for a marathon. Initially I had earphones by a different manufacturer that had something in the middle of the cord that weighed down the earphones & they would fall out or my ear. It also got sweaty & after about 3 months they quit working in the middle of a long Saturday run. 😡 My husband had burned through 2-pair of the expensive brand. The earbuds broke on both pair. I couldn’t pay that kind of money to have the earphones break & not have a battery life that would last for the entire marathon.After searching on the Internet, I found these. ☺️ By the time I got them, my longest run was only 10 miles, but I was pleased. The hook over your ear is comfortable & ensures the earbuds won’t fall out when running. There’s nothing to weigh them down & pull them out of your ear when running (or working out). The sound quality is good. It’s easy to answer the phone if a call comes through while listening. No one has ever complained that they couldn’t hear me. I’ve traveled with these earphones many times. It’s nice to have a case that’s included to protect the earbuds & keep them from breaking. Best of all - the battery life! I used my earphones for just short of 8-hrs on race day & never had a problem. I was afraid they would die towards the end of my race so I took a plug-in pair of earphones for backup & never needed them. I had music before, during, & after the marathon.In short, I give these earphones 5 stars because of the comfort, sound, battery-life & price.

Great Sound Without Breaking The Bank


The sound for the price is really good quality. The ability to adjust the volume and skip songs from the head piece is a nice feature. The only thing that drives me crazy is the cord that connects the ear pieces. It is made of rubber and sticks to the back of my neck so when I turn my head, it pulls one of the ear pieces out. The alternative is to put the cord under your chin but personally, no. So great blue tooth headphones for the price with only one small draw back. Would recommend if you are looking for quality sound without breaking the bank.

This is the third time I have purchased this headphone. I loved them, however the first and second pairs stopped working out of nowhere after about only a year of use. I only use them at the gym and they say that they are waterproof (i.e. sweat resistant), so I don't understand why they have repeatedly stopped working. This is the third time I have ordered them and the connection is very poor with my phone (the music goes in and out constantly). None of the other ones did this. I am unfortunately going to have to send the pair back.

I just got these things after looking to purchase other brands. I am very happy that I purchased these instead, they are great quality for the price! They fit nicely and are not uncomfortable, as I find most ear buds to be. The sound quality is pretty good, and they are easy to pair and use. They also come with extra ear buds, two charge chords, a D.C. adapter, and a cool little carrying case. Definitely satisfied and would recommend to anyone looking for some Bluetooth earphones. I can't wait to take them snowboarding!Update: I like them so much I just bought another pair!

I have been VERY satisfied with these headphones. The connect to my phone almost immediately went turned on. The battery lasts much longer than I had anticipated! The case, cords and car adapter are great and very innovative with microUsb and Apple lightning connector on the same cord. I use the red foam pads which are most comfortable for me and I even used the headphones in the shower to test out the IXP7 water resistance rating without any issue whatsoever. Directions and manuals are clear and straight forward. Overall, you can tell that the product and care taken with packaging and everything that comes with the headphones, this company is doing a great job and delivering a superb product that is well worth the already reasonable cost.

I like to run, but I Earbuds don't fit in my ears properly and fall out at inopportune times. So I took a flyer and bought these. I have to say I'm impressed. The sound quality is really very good--especially considering the price. Another thing I was amazed by was their customer service/tech support line. They answered immediate and helped me sync these with my phone. For around $22 these are a very good deal, and a very good pair of headphones.

Medicore sound quality, poor build


I was tired of running with wired earbuds and having to deal with the cord, so bluetooth seemed like the way to go. I bought these headphones in particular because they were highly rated and the price was reasonable. Unfortunately, the sound quality was pretty bad – sounding muffled and too bass-heavy compared to my middle-of-the-road corded earbuds.I continued to use them rather than go through the hassle of a return, and within 2 or 3 months one side of the headphones had developed a short and the sound constantly cuts in and out while I'm running. In that time I had only worn them about a dozen times, and I kept them in their carrying case in between uses. Bad product all around.

Good product for the price


So far, I've used them once at the gym. Paired with my iPhone 7 Plus. I went as far as 10 feet away from the phone and no dropouts.The reason this isn't getting a 5th star...1) The sound isn't crisp. A little too bassy. Not enough high frequency. Sounds a bit muffle.2) The ear loops are flimsy. They're not as stiff as I thought they'd be. I was jump roping in the gym and the left earbud kept coming off. I haven't switched to another earpiece that it provides you with but usually the ear loop helps keep the earbud from falling off your ear completely.

Ok for the price. Mic and noise cancellation needs improvements.


These are ok headphones for the price. Was skeptical at first, but I gave them a chance. The only thing to keep in mind is that the mic seems to pick up a lot of different noises if you are in a busy area so I wouldn’t purchase this if talking on the phone is it’s main purpose (They can't hear you). I would purchase this again if there are major mic improvements.Sound quality so ok, but needs major improvements on the noise cancellation.I could've gotten a defective product as well.

Since I've only use them twice I'm giving them only 4 stars. However,  I'm hoping they'll be a 5 star. Ok both hubby and I 've been using wired ear buds for awhile. What a pain and inferior sound quality to boot. We looked at all different makes and models in various price range. Why I chose SENSO was due to the reviews and Amazon incredible pricing. They're comfortable, easy and actually fit my tiny earphones. Ive not heard music so clearly before with other ear buds. So, inconclusion, very happy with purchase may order pair for hubby soon.

These stick out from your ears a bit so it's uncomfortable to lay down on your side with them but it is possible. I have only had one instance when they wouldn't pair with my phone. I had to remove them from my phone and sync them again. The loop over the ear helps to keep them in place while using them. Sometimes people have a hard time hearing me when I answer the phone with them but I don't talk a lot with them on. The battery life is really good. I only have to charge them once in a while.

Good value, Lasted almost 1 year of heavy abuse


Good value, good sound, comfortable in the ear, microphone is okay. Endurance is okay too.After almost a year of either being in my ears or floating in my front pocket the left bud bit the big one. I think the wire was pulled out of its terminal cause I can wiggle the wire and get music in a sweet spot. As for how? They often got snagged on my keys while pulling them out of the pocket. I was less than tender with them. So all things considered I'd say they're worth their cost.

Great sound quality,  Lasting battery, Totally worth it!


After having a terrible experience with bluetooth headphones that didn't live up to the hype or even last me a full month before konking out.  These headphones are fantastic!-Awesome bass and overall sound quality.-Music sounds loud even on the lowest volume level so you don't kill your ears.-Charges quickly and the battery lasts long. With my first usage out of box before charge, it lasted me for about 2 hrs. Fully charged I get a solid 5+ hrs on it before I hear the battery low msg and that's because I use them for the better part of my day. (Calls, music, gym)I charge the battery before bed just to get me ready for the next day, but you could definitely go 2 days before charging with moderate usage. I have.The only real difficulty I really had with these were the parts that stay over your ears. It would be great if that can be adjusted for small eared gals like myself. Overall the interchangeable buds make a difference and help with the staying in ear and the comfort of the headphones are great. I also appreciate that this has a one year warranty on them something brand #1 I used did not have.Keep up the good work Invotek.

Not worth 30 bucks


Bought these headphones on January 10, and they stopped working on June 5. I really liked these headphones they had good sound and were easy to pair with my phone. If they would have lasted a year  I probably would have given them a 4 star rating . These headphones are not worth 30 bucks if they're going to work for 5 months. The problem I had was ,I was coming home from my  walk playing my music and all of a sudden they stopped working .Tried to recharge them but that  wasn't the problem .The product just went dead.

Good headphones but is not snug.


The music plays well and it does sound good. My only gripe is it is hard to ensure it does not move around my ear. I tried all three of the buds to get a snug fit but as I run I noticed that occasionally the earpiece would move causing it to shift a bit out of my ear. I occasionally have to re-adjust the earbud in my ear during a single run.I am a male that is 5' 9"" 170 lbs. So I am not a small guy or a big guy. I would expect them to fit a tad better. Either way, I will still use them :)

I have had these for over a year or 2 and they still work great. Sound good. I'm not that picky. Only use these when I workout and they function perfect. Never fell out of my ears.I was in between these and a much more expensive pair and ive been very happy with these. And will purchase again if/when needed.Negative would include the range and connection with multiple devices. I can walk maybe 20 -40 before they start breaking up. And if every time I use my laptop, I have to deactivate them afterwards otherwise on my phone they go in out very frequently. Like I said above, for the price they work great. The negatives are Minor annoyances.Battery life is average. Seems like I charge them every couple days after daily use of an hour or 2.

Pretty weak microphone. Even when I speak louder my usual voice on the phone, people still complain about not being able to hear me. Once I was asked if I had a wall between me and the phone.Other than that,  battery life is wonderful,  synchronization time is flawless.Comfort,  once you get used to them, they're ok.ONLY if they improve their microphones issue.I am using them only in the gym but when I get a call, I  have to turn them off so people can hear me. It's a bit hassle.I would try something different next time.

Great active headphones


These headphones are great for being active. The best thing about them are the mold-able foam earpieces.Sound: These headphones really have a nice sound. They don't sound as good as some multi-hundred dollar headphones but better than anything I've heard in this price range.Stability while moving: The ear hooks help to keep these in place while running, jumping, doing yard work, etc. The mold-able foam earpieces go a long way to keeping these in place as well.Noise cancelling: These are passive noise cancelling (not noise cancelling at all) but the mold-able foam ear pieces block out an impressive amount of outside noise. I will often wear these while mowing the lawn. I will also wear them while running the weed eater... I can't hear audio over the weed eater but they work great as general ear-plugs.Note - There can definitely be a bit of wind noise in high wind situations.Bluetooth range: These seem to do as well, or better than most Bluetooth devices I have.Battery: The battery life on these is great. When I'm not using them much, they'll last weeks. When I'm using them heavily, they'll only last a day or two. I would presume they get about 8 hours of battery life, but they hold battery quite well when not in use.Overall, I have been quite happy with these headphones. The one item that seems to stand out the most though, is definitely the mold-able foam earpieces.

Could not get them to fit my ears snugly, so sound quality and noise cancellation would have been horrible.  BUT, I never got the chance to find out.  Right out of the box, they appeared to charge properly (red LED lit at start, blue LED lit at end), but they would not power up.  After that, they completely died.  No LEDs light when trying to power up, nor when attempting to charge them.  Too bad.  With all the great reviews....

It behaves Weird


Bought this just one year ago and did not use it that much until last month after the COVID-19 force me to stay home more.  It connected and worked OK, not too secure in my ears so I have to adjust them from time to time during my one hour daily jogging.  But since a few days back, it started to suddenly lost the connection, power on/off would not help.  And a re-charge the phone will get it connects again.  This always happens after about 1 hour usage, happened 3-4 times already.  It could mean the battery faded?  What to do next?

I was torn at first. Although The great majority of the reviews were great there were some who gave the headphones horrible reviews. I'm so glad I bought these despite reading a few bad reviews for these headphones. I'm not quite sure what product the bad reviewers were comparing these to but these sound absolutely great with awesome bass. I've had the very popular and very expensive Beats headphones too. That's what made me skeptical about buying these. The charging time is less than an hour for me and after the charge they last me the entire workday and when I go to the gym afterward.

When I try to turn them on when they're plugged in it gives 3 tones indicating I can't turn them on when they're charging which means their internal battery is fubar.

A solid ""Meh"". Good for dialogue, lackluster for music


I just wanted a set of BT headphones for night time gaming and not waking the family. Mic and phone functionality was a plus as I can use them riding my bike to work.I went with the ""#1 Top Seller!"" figuring a zillion Amazon buyers couldn't be wrong, right? Nope.These will be ok for some people - and in truth, they were ok for my original gaming objective. But their portability had me trying them out for general headphone use and that's where they fall flat on their face.Some quick background before I continue: that job I ride my bike to?  I'm a professional television video editor by trade, and for better or worse, the last 15 years have left me with no tolerance for substandard audio quality.  I'm not an audiophile or sound snob. I just can't handle muddy sound. I tried to like these earbuds - I really did. Even considering the price, their boomy bass, yet midrange-heavy sound and lack of separation had me aching to get back to my wired Sonys. The Sensos went back to Amazon within a few days.If you're just listing to dialogue or phone calls​, these might do the trick, but they fall well short when music comes into play.

BATTERY DIES!!!!!  VOLUME TOO LOUD!!!!!  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!


I bought these headphones almost a year ago. They are WAAAAY TOO LOUD if you have an iPhone.  On the lowest volume settings the sound is as if it were almost halfway up to the max.  I guess thats fine during the day, but if you like to watch a little youtube while you fall asleep at night, FORGET IT.After a year the Battery wouldn't hold a charge so i emailed customer service.  At first they were helpful, providing me with a few tricks to try to reset it.  The promised me if it didnt work they would replace it since it died just be fore the warranty expired.  BUT THEY DID NOT HONOR THAT PROMISE.  They told me I was out of warranty and give me a MEASLY 5% coupon to buy a new pair from them - YEAH RIGHT!!!  Let me buy ANOTHER piece of garbage.  i pointed out in an email how they went back on their promises and got no reply.  2 more emails after that and STILL NO REPLY.Thanks for nothing SENSO - you are the WORST!DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!

Great value for money. Works well for audiobooks/podcasts while exercising. Cheap enough to not worry about loss.


Purchased these primarily for workouts and dog walks. Great value for the money - I wanted something inexpensive so I don't need to worry about losing them or destroying them. However, they don't seem flimsy - they worked well even though I put them in the wash by accident.Pros:  * Cost  * Stay snug in ear during different types of exercise (running, weightlifting, yoga, walks)  * Audio quality sufficient for audiobooks/podcasts, haven't tested on music as much  * Charge seems to last for a whileCons:  * Controls are sometimes counter-intuitive. Have had it accidentally ""Dial last number"" rather than power off a few times. I wish they were simpler - just on/off and pairing mode.  * Placing phone in my pocket can lead to very choppy noise. I haven't compared this with other BT headsets though and don't know if this is a simple interference issue that nothing would solve, phone issue, or headset issue.

Faulty Engineering


These headphones  are great especially for active people. They are waterproof and work well. The sound quality is amazing and the noise cancellation is excellent.The problem lies within the engineering of the earplugs themselves. After 4 months of owning these there was a shortage in the wiring. After receiving a replacement there was a problem with charging them. The light wouldnt turn on so I was unaware when they were fully charged.This company has received over $35 of mine. If I don’t receive my new replacement than I’m moving on to give another company business.

There GRRREAT!!!


I couldn't be happier! First of all,  before I ordered this,  I read many reviews on this product! Then when I  was about to order this, a sentence came up that if I order it today they would send me a second one free! I put in the  order, and sure enough I got a second one for free! Everything that they said was included, did come in the box! After reading the instructions, I was ready to test them out.  They come with three sizes of earbuds, the small ones were comfortable for me. First I tested them on my iPhone 6 Plus,  they paired easily and sounded great! And everything I tested them with, I was able to adjust the volume  accordingly to my comfort. They fit well around the ear and are secure. I work out on a treadmill  about two hours, four days a week and have no problem with the earbuds moving around!  Also I have a 10 inch android tablet, that also pairs easily with and also  has great sound! Then, I tried him with the cell phone, and had absolutely no problem hearing the person on the other line,  and the person on the other line had no problem during me! I've had Bluetooth headsets in the past with complaints that another person on another line of their cell phone  I always had trouble hearing me. If you're looking for Bluetooth earbuds, I highly recommend these, you will not be disappointed!

Good while they lasted


This are good headphones. The only, but major, downside is that they stopped working after 2 years. And its not that I used them every day during this time. I use them mostly during the weekends. Meaning they lasted around 200 days which is the equivalent of 6 months if you use them daily. Sound quality was good.

Was so happy until 1.5 yrs later


Was impressed by this pair of earbuds, great sound, good soundproofing, quickly pair/connect and held steady while working out (cardio 2x a week). But 1.5 yrs later now the left one seems to be failing - sounds like a bad connection, very annoying! When I fuss with the cable attaching the earpiece to the cable it seems to be better, thus I conclude the cable is becoming unconnected from the left base when I move. Maybe just my pair and not a huge investment but would have been nice to have lasted longer 2-3 yrs given I used max 3times a week. The other bad thing about these is that people can not really hear you well during a call.

I tried another brand of similar style and had to return as they kept cutting out while I was running.  I decided to give these a try and have used them a number of times now out running and while doing yard work and they have worked great!  For the price I don't think you can really go wrong.  Volume is decent, they come with a case and several different ear fittings for size.  Right after my purchase I received an email providing me with a number that claims 24/7 365 days live support and a 1 year warranty.  After I received them I did receive another follow-up email providing me the same information.

My recommendation would be buy two pairs because you will love them that much


I bought them for my boyfriend who uses his phone for everything and works from home.  He loves them!  We are already talking about a second pair for his back up when he travels for work, so he is never without it.  I wish I had tried these before purchasing the Samsung Icons earbuds.  $200 for 1.5 your use is not worth it.  When answering a call with the Senso earbuds, I felt like the person was right next to me, crystal clear reception. The control buttons click on the Senso which I like.  I'm constantly swiping on the Iconx because it's so sensitive.  My recommendation would be buy two pairs because you will love them that much!!!

Great Product and great personal service


Even before I got the headphones I received a personal note from one of the owners of the company ensuring that I knew I could reach out to them if I had any problems. The product arrived on time and my daughter absolutely adores them! They fit comfotrtably with great noise cancelling properties . They're everything you could ask for in great wireless headphones:comfort ,quality and an astounding price point. The personal service is exceptional and makes you feel like a valued customer .

Great Product for Active Buyers


The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are perfect for active people who are on the go. Especially, those who are looking for a highly usable product for a more affordable price than name-brand competition. If you are someone who is looking to ""cut the cord,"" this product will be of use to you. The three major factors that made this a 5-star product were value, design, and battery life. The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones exceed expectations in all of these categories.ValueYou can find many Bluetooth headphones on Amazon, but these far exceed any on the market, for the very affordable price of $30. This is a very good price for someone that doesn't want to be hampered by a cord while listening to their music during workouts. For the price, the sound is also quite excellent. You also receive a compact case to store your headphones and two chargers, which is helpful in case you misplace a charger. If you buy these headphones and they don't fit your needs, there is a 30 days no-questions-asked return policy. Also, included with the purchase is a 1-year Manufacturer's Warranty.DesignBluetooth Headphones are a very utilitarian product, made with the consumer at the center of the production. The best quality of these headphones are over-the-top ear hooks that help hold the headphones in the ears during functional activities, such as running and weightlifting. The headphones themselves fit very comfortably into your ears and don't cause discomfort during extended periods of wear. Another important factor is the wire that wraps behind the neck during use. The wire is just the right length needed. While running, the wire does tend to bounce around on your neck, but it stays tangle free. After 10 months of use, there have been no issues with this product.Battery LifeThese headphones have a long-lasting battery life. I use these for about 2-3 hours at a time and recharge every 2-3 days. They charge quite quickly, if you are ever in a pinch and forgot to charge them the night before. While the notifications you get before they actually shut off come frequently, about every 30 to 60 seconds, it's a good indicator you have about 10-15 minutes of usability left.Overall, SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are a great buy for anyone seeking a useful product that doesn't break the bank. With a good design and extended battery life, you cannot beat this 5-star product for it's reasonable price. SENSO Bluetooth headphones will keep pace with your active lifestyle!

Lasted me 3 years and hundreds of miles


I purchased these in February 2017. This week (May 2020) they finally started dying after only one run, I’m assuming that’s because the battery is just worn out.  I’m going to buy another pair, they lasted over 3 years so I count that as a huge win! Highly recommend these - good base, comfortable, and I never have to worry about them falling out.

They've outlasted many other headphones I've used. Impressive overall


These are possibly the best wireless earphones I have used yet.I have been through quite a few sets of earphones and most don't seem to last long. These seemed to follow that trend, as they stopped charging after the second use.However I replaced the USB cord and it charged again. They fit well, don't fall out and sound pretty good. They connect fast, but the range isn't amazing. They seem pretty sweat resistant which is very important to me. I'd recommend them, especially considering the price.

Lots of connection issues with Apple Watch


I’ve had these headphones for about a month now and they’re not good.Sometimes, the headphones will take a while to connect, if at all. I use these headphones with my Apple Watch or my iPhone X and it’s always having connection issues.And lately I’ve noticed spotty Bluetooth connection has started to fade in and out when connected to my Apple Watch. My watch is literally 1 foot away from the headphones so I don’t know what the problem is.

About as good as you are going to get for this money


These are the first wireless headphones I have ever purchases and have had them for about two weeks now. Over all I am pleased with them and for the price I don't think they could be much better.  They fit my ears well and the sound they produce is as crisp and clear as the sound I have found in more expensive name brand wired headphones.  I do have a few critiques that are minor and which would not change my buying decision but are annoying.1. When I am out on a run if there is even a slight breeze you hear it across the ear pieces. Maybe there is a way to position the ear pieces in my ears differently to avoid this but I haven't found it.2. The headphones die without much warning. When the low battery warning comes on you have about a minute before they die. The problem is that the battery indicator on the phone still shows about 25% when they are really at 10% or less. Twice I have been in the middle of a run and they have died on me when it looked like I should have enough power to do the entire run and then some. I know I could charge them more often but I try to not charge my batteries until they are dead or mostly dead to preserve them. Kind of annoying. It would be nice if they started letting you know your battery was dying with about 30 minutes of battery life left.3. Number three relates to number 2. The battery life in these seems pretty short. They claim it is 8 hours. I'm not sure that is accurate.As i said, overall I would buy them again but they aren't perfect. But for the price, probably about as good as you are going to get.

SENSO Good Sound Poor FIT


Sound quality is Good 3 Stars, setup with iPhone easy and flawless - 5 Stars, the next category is the Fit - 0 Stars:  I bought the SENSO for my daughter to use for gym workouts. She called me and thanked me but said she's had zero luck with this style of headphone wired or wireless. I should of listen after 1st use she called to complain.  I figured it was a user problem so I traded by brand new Platronics BackBeat Bluetooth headphones with built in microphone for her SENSO's.  The Headphones: wrap over your ears and sit inside the ear canal BUT they don't stay inside the canal extremely FRICK'N ANNOYING move your head or body they fall out of ear and dangle off your ears EXTREMELY ANNOYING in case I forgot to mention!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Headphones come with 3 silicone cup sizes to fit your ear canal and I tried all 3 sizes, Sm-Med-LG, produces same result the dangling headphones. Price is right sound quality is good but the closer is the FIT Quality ------------SUCKS  a double thumbs down

Confortable


The sound is good. They are comfortable. I find that the switch control box tends to drift and hang to the right side a lot and doesn't stay in the center.  one of the main problem is, I am only getting about 2 hours out of a charge then the music starts to sound like a record skipping (for those who where around and remember that) this was one of my first blue tooth experiences so maybe that 2 hrs. is normal?

Quality Product and Great Customer Support!


I bought these back during the summer of 2017 after my old pair of 3.5mm headphones finally kicked the bucket. It took a couple days to get used to the way that they sat in my ears, but after that initial period, they feel great to wear whether I'm working out or studying for hours on end - something I wouldn't be able to do without their long battery life. The only time I have ever had them die on me is if I went multiple days of heavy use without charging them. For reference, I regularly use them in between classes, while working out, and while studying and they've never unexpectedly died on me. The sound quality is great, being able to provide a solid base despite being so small and light, without sacrificing the sound clarity. They can play at high volumes while keeping up the sound quality and the freedom of movement from not having a cord connected to my device makes them a must-have at the gym or when I have a lot of books on my desk while studying. I have since recommended them to my friends who have purchased them and would rate them similarly.What sparked this review was that one of the ears on the headphones started making this buzzing sound that was prominent if you were listening to music at a non-loud volume, which was very distracting while trying to study. I contacted SENSO's customer support who responded very quickly and were very helpful! The troubleshooting steps they offered unfortunately didn't fix my problem, so they very promptly sent a replacement pair since I was still within the 1-Year Full Warranty period. They arrived today, and I'm currently using them as I'm writing this review! The replacement set look and feel similar to the original pair, but they have made small changes to the design which give it a more premium look and feel. As far as I can tell, they sound as good if not better than the old pair. Either way, if anything happens to this pair, I will most likely buy another pair of them as I have had nothing but success with the product.

Great earphones at a great price!


Bought these nearly a year ago and use them 5-6 days a week between work, gym, running and traveling. I keep them in the case to prevent damage when not in use. Only had one issue, I dropped them and they would not connect via bluetooth to any device. I performed a factory reset and they've worked perfectly since. Sound is decent but certainly not Bose quality. All in all these are great and I will purchase another pair when these die.

Good quality, but not a good fit


This is a tough review to write, because the headphones may well be everything they were designed to be, but my wife nevertheless asked me to return them. We bought them to supplement, and hopefully upgrade, a less expensive pair of SoundBEATS headphones that she uses to watch shows on her iPad around the house and in bed. The battery wasn't lasting very long, so these should have provided a longer battery life - with the others as backup - and probably better sound. Unfortunately, she didn't find them comfortable. The over-the-ear loops didn't fit quite right and the bulkier earpiece (which probably supported a larger battery and better acoustics) was also uncomfortable, especially lying on her side in bed. So, without even having a chance to verify whether these offered far superior battery life or sound, these went back to Amazon.

Great headphones and accessories that came with it. They stay on while sprinting and jogging. They have survived my sweaty workouts and did not come off even once. Sound quality is superb and is worth the price. The rubber ear hook attachments are very flexible and do not hurt my ears. I had these on for four hours until I had to take them off because of slight discomfort, but that's a lot longer than my regular earphones.All in all, I love these headphones and would buy them again if I ever lose them.

Broken after ~2 months, customer service MIA


I used this product for about 2 months before they stopped powering on. I contacted customer service to report the malfunction, and received a prompt reply from a rep named Amelia. That is the last time I heard from her (or anyone else). I emailed Amelia telling her the troubleshooting steps she sent me did not solve the issue (performing a factory reset), and haven't heard back since. I've tried to contact her 3 times since then.Also, when I was performing said troubleshooting steps, the wire connecting the two earbuds snapped in half. With the plethora of options out there today for budget bluetooth headphones, stay away from Senso. In my experience, they're the worst quality of the half-dozen or so pairs that I've owned over the years. I'd expect to be ghosted while using a dating app, but definitely not while trying to resolve a customer service inquiry.

The best Bluetooth I've ever used!


I have only had my headphones for about 2 weeks but I absolutely love them!The sound is great! I love the bass!The medium buds a bit too big and the small buds are a bit too small but I'm a small person and have a hard time getting a good fit with any headphones. BUT the over the ear design works great! Even though the buds aren't as snug as I'd like it still blocks out the noise because of the design.They come with a hard case to hold the charger, extra buds, and earbuds themselves.It even comes with two slides to hold the cords together to wear them around your neck.I bought these based on the reviews. I'm no audio expert but I'd say being a normal person these are much BETTER than the name brands you will pay WAY more money for.It also comes with a one year guanantee!

Great customer service!


I use my headphones for working out, running and biking. The different size ear pieces make it easy to keep the headphones in my ears and the bendable ear hooks allow for a tight fit (I've had problems with other ear phones falling out to easily, especially when running). I listen to podcasts and books on tape and the quality is clear. Also like the button placement. The sweat proof feature is a plus for me as I look like I've been exploring a tropical rain forest, sweat wise, by the end of a work out. I had a problem with my headphones no longer charging after 7 months and contacted the dealer. They walked me through a couple of possible fixes over the phone and when they solve the problem, they sent a new pair which arrived in a few days. This was a no-hassel replacement process which I greatly appreciated. Would buy again from this dealer.

I like to listen to music


I am not an avid runner, but when I do, I like to listen to music. I had been looking for some headphones that were Bluetooth and somewhat economical. This set was right for the price, however, I had an issue when it came to jogging/running. They did not stay in place and kept slipping. This was so annoying. I used them twice and tried them on with different size ear piece (small and medium). It was no use. For walking or casual listening they are fine. The price is great, but they did not work for me. I bought a plantronics set instead. Those, Plantronics, are great. A bit more expensive, but they are worth it.

14 months, then inexplicable death


After a little over a year, the headphones have stopped working. They worked marvelously as normal this morning, then I put them on to charge and now the power on, say connected and then go silent and turn off without the customary beeps. Once this happens, they won't respond for 10 minutes of trying to get them to turn on again. Then after about 10 minutes the whole cycle starts again.While they worked, they had decent sound, great range, and were very reliable.

First Impressions 👌


I just received my headphones yesterday. What came in the box was way more than I was expecting. Not only did it come with the headphones, extra buds, and charging cable, it came with a separate USB to USB micro/Lightning cable, a two port car charger, and a decent clamshell case to hold everything but the car charger.The included buds were adequate. There was a separate pair that were exceptional. They are made from ear plug material and really mold to my canals.Audio seem to be really good. Not excellent, but I haven't run a ton of music through them yet, so I'm undecided. Totally worth the money though.I wore them to the gym last night. It was great not to accidentally yank my phone off them machine with my old wired headphones. I'll update my review in a few months with my long term opinion. 9/10 so far for accessories and value.

Fragile, cheap


I am really disappointed with how fragile these headphones really are. I have used these TWICE, and the volume is already distorted. Be careful not to pickup by the chord, as they are loosely seated into each earbud. The chords loosening will make the (already mediocre) volume worse. I am VERY particular about how I handle my equipment, and by no means used this piece past normal ""wear and tear"".. I would save yourself the time and money and just invest in an established brand of headphones. Goodluck!

Great product - great price


Wow - these have been amazing!  When I first put them on they had a good bit too much base. I use Spotify on my iPhone, so I found, purchased and installed for 3 bucks an equalizer app called Qu.  I then adjusted base down and treble up a bit and compared these to my wife's VERY expensive Beats. These are as good if not better for a 3rd the price.  Comfortable to wear, holds on tight when I exercise - I'm a BIG BIG fan...So I lost my first pair and got a second pair - updated version - it's even better sound - love these!

Lifespan could be better, but great headphones


I really like these headphones and they have been very reliable. I have recommended them to 4 other people on my team. Unfortunately, they only have a lifespan of about 1.5 years, which is good, but I wish they hadn't just gone out on me! All of a sudden they have stopped working and shut off while  I'm listening, even though they are fully charged. Huge bummer.

Great budget wireless headphones


Update: I contacted the seller about their warranty on these earbuds and they promptly replaced them. Very satisfied with the product and customer service.These Bluetooth headphones are easy to use, have long lasting battery life, short charge time, and very good sound. However, the cable connecting the two can be annoying when they get stuck on your neck or when trying to listen with only one earbud in. Also, the connection on the left earbud has started to go in and out with the slightest movement of the right earbud after about 6 months. These still lasted longer than most of my wired headphones but at $30+ dollars I would have liked them to last longer. Still a good value and do what they say they will. I recommend using the provided case as it is very easy to lose the earbud tips if you keep them in your pocket.

Great until they suddenly died


They were fantastic earbuds. I love the over ear design for use while exercising. The sound was great and they held a charge.Until they stopped working a week ago. They died faster than usual and won't accept a charge. No red or blue light when plugged in to USB. Tried multiple cables and ports. No damage, no water damage, well taken care of. They just stopped working. Would give them a 5 star if they didn't break.Your mileage may vary, but I guess you get what you pay for.

They work well and connect very quickly, but sound quality leaves much to be desired.


These headphones are decent for use in situations where you may not care much for audio quality, such as working out, running, cycling, doing yard, etc. They fit extremely well and are very comfortable to wear. However, when it comes to sound quality, they aren't very good. The treble is pretty much non-existent and the bass is way too boomy. Using this with my phone, I had to mess with my audio player's equalizer to get them sounding acceptable, but that will only take effect in the audio player. Any other apps I may be using while also using the headphones will sound pretty bad. If you have the ability to mess with an equalizer, these are fine for the price. However, I have a pair of $12 wired Skullcandy earbuds that sound better than these without needing to mess with an equalizer. I'm really only keeping these because they are bluetooth and I need something with no cables while doing yard work and cycling.

UPDATE: working now.  They sent a unit without a working battery.  Poor quality control.


Got a dud, battery won't charge with the UBS cord they provided, or any other UBS cord. So I can't rate it as anything but the worst possible rating, as this unit is completely and utterly useless.  Will be returning for a refund, not a replacement.  Looks nice, though.Update:  Customer service contacted me and walked me through how to get it to charge.  So that's nice and they work pretty well, but a lot more drama than should be required to use them.

Super headphones, much better quality than you'd think for this price.


I'm really happy with these headphones.  The bluetooth connected immediately, the buttons are SO easy to use (which I appreciate, because sometimes you have to hunt for the buttons), and the sound quality is great.  I'm pretty impressed considering the price I paid.  I thought they'd be more throwaway quality that I wouldn't worry about when (not if) I lose them.  They're good!  If I changed anything I'd make the ear hooks a little more firm.  Not that that they don't work well - they hang on well.  It's just that they're so soft that they give me the impression that they'll fall off. (So yes, I'm bringing up something that feels like it might be an issue, but isn't.)  :)

I gave them away after a week. I tried every bud like I was instructed and they still fell out every five seconds while I'm jogging. they fall out even while I was double shooting just sitting. the loop that sits above the ear is rubbery and doesn't not have wiring to help mold to your ear. the sound was good. it connects easily, I never used it to make phone calls. I didn't not like them at all I almost threw them away on my last run out of frustration.

Not sweatproof, do not buy for running and the gym!


Buyer beware, these are NOT sweat proof and should not be used heavy exercise or running.  This is my third pair and was initially attracted to the best seller rating and large amounts of reviews. They worked fine and fit better than most headphones I had tried for running during the winter months, but as soon as it started to warm up and I started sweating a bit more, I lost audio in one ear.Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I ordered another pair and one for my dad as well.  After not even a week of the new ones, the same issue happened. I returned that pair and received a new one. Well, around two weeks later I was out of a run, felt a drop of sweat running from my ear and the second it hit the earbud, I lost all audio. Now they are completely dead and I can no longer return them.I suppose for everyday use these may be fine, but I heavily advise against using them for the gym / running. To advertise as the ""Best Wireless Sports Earphones... IPX7 Waterproof... Sweatproof Earbuds"" is disingenuous and wrong.

I LOVE these headphones. I was wearing them when my granddaughter saw them. Boom, gave them to her and ordered again. I wear them all the time and lost order #2, hopefully they’ll turn up somewhere in the house!  I am now on order #3 and truly can’t say enough about them.

Solid Bluetooth Sports Headphones, 1-Year Warranty


These sound really good, with long battery life and a snug, comfortable fit in my ears, even while jogging. Pairing with my iPhone was quick and easy. The carrying case and other accessories are a nice bonus.After I first purchased these, over a period of a few months, their quality and functionality gradually deteriorated until they were completely dead. The company (Tekatron / Senso) more than honored their warranty -- they sent me the newer S-255 model within a few days. The process was very easy, with thorough communications along the way. I'm optimistic that my previous pair was a rare lemon and that I'll get years of use out of the new pair. (If not, I'll be sure to update this review.)The only thing I would change about the headphones is the button layout. + (Volume Up, Next Track) is on the left and - (Volume Down / Previous Track) is on the right -- completely counterintuitive and a little frustrating, but not a dealbreaker. Unfortunately, the buttons on model S-255 are the same.I only give five stars for perfection. If there was a 4.5-star option, I'd use it. I'm just docking one star for the previous product failure and the button layout.

Doesn't work while swimming. Immediately looses signal even if your device is on you.


I used these for just a few minutes today. I was very anxious to get these because I wanted to listen to my music while I swam in the pool. They have great sound and they are comfortable. But they don't work when swimming. They constantly loose signal. Even if the phone is on your person. I was so disappointed. I thought this is gonna be cool to listen to my music while I'm getting exercise and enjoying my time in the pool.:-|  it's a no go. Other than that. There good.

The instructions were faulty, however....


I was going to return them because the instructions on how to charge headphones was inaccurate. The red light did not come on indicating they were charging. I called tech support and after numerous attempts they agreed they would not charge. They were sending me a replacement set and a return postage sticker. I decided to try them a day later and they worked excellent. I listened to music for over 7 hours. I am guessing somebody charged them then returned them. The red light now comes on when charging but the blue light never luminates. I love these headphones and decided to keep the replacement set to give as a gift. Great product for the money.

Not The Best For Running


I got these for running. They do not stay in my ear and the black part that goes behind the ear never stays contoured to my ear and therefore it is serving no other purpose other than making it more difficult for the ear bud to stay in my ear. I'm constantly pushing it back in when running.I shouldn't of messed around with another cheap pair of headphones and just shelled out for a Bose pair. Those are the only headphones I've ever owned that stayed in when running but unfortunately they caught on something in my gym bag and the part that kept them in my way got ripped off.

Great Headphones for the Price but Stop Working Quickly


I really liked these headphones. The sound quality was great for the price and they stayed in my ears for all my runs. However, after only having them a couple of months they will not charge with any cable from any source. I have tried the cable they came with along with several others. I have tried charging it both from the computer and from the wall and neither will work.It's disappointing because I thoroughly enjoyed these headphones, but they stopped working so quickly without any heavy wear and tear.

Sounded great for an hour...then it started cutting out.  I charged fully when I got it, so I don't know if it's a battery issue or a connection issue.  Really disappointed. :(::Update:: Tried the reset per the manufacturer's suggestion.  This time, I was cutting out within about 10 minutes.  Returning.

I have a nice pair of Bose over the ear headphones, but when outside walking my dog they tend to fall off when leaning over to pick up.  These Senso are just the ticket and the sound is fab with pretty good quality and a year quarantee.  I found a good fit within the included three tips and they are comfortable and stay on nicely.  Instructions are good and customer support if needed seems to be there with an e=mail from one of the company owners right after delivery.  Lots of good reviews on you tube and Amazon.

2nd pair (one for work and one for home)


This is my second pair of these headphones.  I use them to listen to music at work.  For some reason, this pair is a lot louder at work using the lowest setting (I wish I could adjust the sound one notch lower, but there must be an issue with my worker computer) than at home using the web based GooglePlay to listen to music.  Nice sound.  Con: plugs will move a little out of place while jogging, but not big deal; you can bend the attachments but it still won't be snug on your ear for a long time while jogging.

I am just obsessed with these headphones. I love the dofferent sized ear buds because i have weird ears and standard ones dont usually fit me so it was nice to have a smaller option. They sit very comfortavly around the ear also. Spund is great and i love that i can completely control it from the headphones themselves. Volume, pause, turn on/off, skip a song or go back. AND i can answer my phone when someones calling and use it to talk to them, and hang up. They are just perfect, everything i wanted. Highly Recommend!

I wasn't looking for Bose-quality sound because for the gym I don't want to spend that much $.  These are very good:  sound, features, comfort, quick charging and long lasting.  Very pleased.*One year later, and these are still going strong. I'm so impressed, I had to add the update.  I'm careful with them, but not exceptionally so, and my wires are just fine so far. Sound is good, links in seconds, no drop-out. The charge lasts a really long time.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

Hey, these are pretty good.


They work pretty we.. Have been using them when I am shoveling snow and they are very nice. Sound quality is on par with my corded skullcandy. Have plenty of bass. Battery life seems to be good as well. Also have worn them for several hours and they do not become uncomfortable after longer periods like some of the other headphones I have owned. The over the ear piece is a floppy piece of silicone, but it seems to be enough resistance to keep them in place. I will be buying them again if I need replacements.

Found a keeper


Connected the ear buds and got back to work without no problems or distractions!When moving around outside my office area (beyond 10') and listening to music the audio does cut out a bit but not too disruptive for my causal listening.  Inside my office the audio doesn't cut out at all.  I won't generally be more than 10' from my audio source so this isn't a deal breaker for me.  The audio quality certainly isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either.  I didn't notice any noise cancellation - felt and sounded more like wearing ear plugs than active noise cancellation. For context, when wearing the both ear buds and playing music at low volume I could barely hear noises around me.  As far as comfort goes, I'm glad there are multiple sizes of ear tips but wearing the stock (medium?) tips for 2 hours straight didn't render any discomfort at all.UPDATE: I've found the audio does in fact cut out... a lot.  But only when the audio source is inside something like a backpack, pocket, or purse.  When sitting on top of a desk, there are no audio issues so these have been great for connecting to my computer, not so much for biking or walking.What would I change?  It would be great to have adjustable ear hooks and reverse the volume up/down controls (I keep turning the volume down when I want to turn it up).

Sound Quality, Noise Cancelling, Battery Life


First saw the these headphones on ""Today's Deals"". Noticed it had over 21000 reviews with 4.5 stars. Bought them, and they are unbelievable. The sound quality, amazing. Battery life, unbelievable. Does not even take long to fully charge them once the battery is actually low! On top of all this, the noise cancelling is awesome. Overall the best headphones I could have ever purchased. I've had Beats before as well, but these headphones are definitely better! The best part, THEY'RE AFFORDABLE. Why spend hundreds of dollars on headphones when you can just buy these and be amazed. No joke, not even exaggerating.

Low quality, break easily


I have owned three of these earbuds. The first lasted for several months and then one side stopped working. I thought they were pretty good for the price, so I ordered them again, thinking maybe it was just something I did that caused one side to go out. The second pair would not charge or turn on when I received them, so I exchanged them with Amazon. The third pair worked fine for about four uses and then the ON/PLAY button got stuck and will not pop back out, rendering them useless (unfortunately just after the return window was up). THESE ARE LOW QUALITY earbuds with poor quality control. They would be worth the price if they were more reliable and lasted. I would suggest Anker earbuds in this price range instead (similar sound, much better range, longer battery life and have lasted me several months of daily use so far).

Broke in less than 2 months


Worked great the first two months. Low and behold the lower volume button stopped working. A week later the device emitted a beep and the Bluetooth stopped working. I tried a factory reset and nothing. I payed for a product that lasted less than 2 months and I got very little use at that.I contacted their customer service, they were very friendly and sent me a new set. Hopefully it works out because I really did like the headphones they were nice and tight.

Best bluetooth headphones I've used.


Fantastic bluetooth headphones. I run a lot and tried other brands that just didn't work out, but these headphones are wonderful. The sound is great. I love the big button on the side to pause/resume the music. They are very comfortable. I've worn them on 20+ mile runs and don't even know that I'm wearing them, other than the music. The battery lasts for a long time. I love the storage case that came with it, and the bonus charger and cables were a nice touch.Only complaints:-I think it is a problem with all bluetooth headphones, but if your phone is on the left side of your body (I wear mine in a running belt on the front) and you turn your head too far, the connection drops out momentarily because the bluetooth signal doesn't pass through your body well, even though it is like 2 feet from the source.-Once the battery gets low, there is a warning that plays every minute or so. You have less than 10 minutes from the first warning to completely dead. I just have to remember to charge them up every few days.

Using these for running, walking and general use. The over-the-ear loop helps hold them in place and the in-ear is comfortable. The volume gets very loud so I don't turn them all the way up often. Battery life is 8 hours +/- or about a week most of the time. I would buy these again.

These work as well as headphones I had that were more expensive


I've owned several different brands of bluetooth headphones (both more than twice as much as these) and I'm giving these 5 stars (really 4 1/2) because for the price this headset performs great. I use them for yard work and exercising almost daily. In the 3 weeks I've owned them they have had 1 minor problem and that I occurs right after I turn them on and connect them (un-pairing and re-pairing doesn't fix it). When I'm using them on my Samsung S5 and listening to MP3's the first 5 seconds of the first song (after connection) it garbles it and then works fine thereafter. I keep my phone in a holster on my hip and just like my previous headsets it seems to like being on my right side (where the controls are) for best connection,especially if your wearing an untucked shirt. This is not unique to this brand as I've had 2 other brands that did the same thing. Vendors should boost the signal because phones are getting too big to wear on an armband. I've had headphones that had a stiff headband around the back and a pair that had a cord. By far the cord was best especially when you have long hair or wear something with a collar. The loops around the ears are a little flimsy but they do work better when I'm wearing sunglasses and they're good enough to keep them on my ears during all kinds of activity. Besides earbuds don't do well even when I'm not bouncing around, they tend to fall out or make my ears hurt. Playing music or using as a phone the sound is better that I would hope for at the price of this brand and comparable or better to my previous headsets. I've left them on the charger excessively long many times and haven't ran into the same issues I saw in other reviews (cross my fingers). I've had them for going on a month now so I feel comfortable making this review, if that changes I will change my review.  I tried to put in this review everything I look for when I'm reading reviews form other people on headphones.

I only removed one star b/c the headphones don't really clip on to my ears. It can be a bit annoying to shove the earbuds in, but the clip doesn't fit at all on my ears. I always have to wiggle the ear pieces around until I can get it just right...but they still fall out here and there. Also the star was removed b/c you don't get text message alerts, only phone calls. Other than that, they work well, calls are clear and haven't had any complaints about people not being able to hear me, even on the busy streets of Brooklyn. Overall, great buy.

Good Headphones for under $40


If you are looking for a pair of cheap Bluetooth headphones that will hold up with daily use, the SENSO Bluetooth headphones may be a good choice. These headphones are perfect for all your music listening needs as a college student.I have had these headphones since October of 2017 and have had a very good experience so far. The headphones may take a few tries to get connected to different devices, but after the initial setup there shouldn’t be a need to re-pair the headphones. Whenever the headphones connect with a device, the first few seconds of audio transmitted from the device come through stuttering. This can be solved by pausing the audio until the stuttering stops or reconnecting to the device. Afterward, the sound should come through clear.The quality of this product is decent for being under $40. The sound quality is well balance and the battery holds a charge for an average of 6-8 hours. These headphones come with a carrying case but so far have held up to being in backpacks and purses without the extra protection. The multi-sized ear pieces allow for personalized wearer comfort; however, the external support loops may make your ears sore after 3 to 4 hours of continuous use. It is helpful to have the loops when working out though. These headphones haven’t fallen off through one of my running workouts yet.Another feature of these headphones is to be about to answer phone calls. The microphone is far from the mouth and has a hard time picking up your voice when making phone calls. This makes it hard for the other person to hear what you are saying. It is a nice option to be able to have handsfree phone calls without using the speaker function of your phone and is useful when you are in a quiet environment.Overall the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are a great buy for anyone looking for a cheap but durable set of Bluetooth headphones.

So sad, they hurt my ears


I was so excited to receive my wireless headphones.  My phone is kinda funky sometimes and it is wonderful to have wireless headphones while I am talking on the phone as well as when I am working out.  These are amazing headphone except for one issue.  They rub the insides of my ears.  So I end up using one for a while and then changing to the other side.  I almost never use both at the same time because it will seriously limit how long I can use them.  That is the only reason for the 3 star rating.  If it wasn't for that issue they definitely would have been a 5 star item.

Surprisingly Great Senso Bluetooth Headphones


I just opened these (Senso Bluetooth Headphones) The packaging is gorgeous and you can read and understand the instructions. Easy to read and decent sized print which is important to me because my eyes are not that strong. I listened to Pandora on my phone with these earphones and the sound was wonderful. I then called a friend and she could here me well. It has noise cancellation. I like the curved over the ear wires because they hold the ear buds securely in place. My experience with ear buds without the wire over the ear always seem to fall out of my ears when exercising etc.They also include a long charging cord and a short charging cord, a double USB port to connect to the car power, a nice attractive carry case etc. A lot of thought went into the packaging, the instructions the design etc.In the past I have had Plantronics and other fancy brands and none of them compare to these and the price for these is incredibly low. Given the low price I did not expect this quality but it is there.I have only put them on and tried them this evening. I do not know how they will last but given the design I expect they will perform well over time.

These worked really well at first.  I was underwhelmed by the sound quality, but hey for $35 I wasn't complaining.  After a few months the connectivity started to decline.  They cut out a lot even when they are right next to my iphone 7.Senso support had me do a reset which helped a little bit, but I don't think any cutting out is acceptable - bluetooth technology has been around for a long time.  They are willing to replace but not refund.  So I will give the new set a try, but don;t have high hopes

[UPDATE] 4-6-2018.  The quality on these are terrible.  I have now had (2) pairs in 24 months and both have failed over time.  They lose their ability to hold a charge and cut out (beep) when connected.  BOO!These headphones are excellent!  I've used them in the rain, I sweat quite a bit and was running and they were excellent.  Very comfortable, audio quality was way better than the default iPhone ear buds.  They were very easy to use and seem to hold a charge very well.  Considering the price they are an AMAZING VALUE!

I am a multiple headphones owner, like many.  I received the SENSO BT Headphones quickly (Prime), and a nice follow up email from the folks at SENSO.  The product is packaged nicely, comes with extras, and a nice case.  My ears are smaller, so I appreciate the option of changing the buds, which I did.  The headphones paired quickly and easily with my Samsung GS5.  They work great, and sound great!  Good balance of bass to treble.  I bought the headphones to ride my bike, AND ride my horse, I have not done either yet, however, I do think they'll hold in place.  Thanks SENSO, they promise to be a really nice solution!!

This Bose Snob Has Gone Senso!


As a Bose Snob, I have to say I am so happy with my Senso wireless headphones, I just bought a pair for my husband and a second pair for me. I finally went wireless when I discovered the iPhone 6 jack has a problem so that my $200 Bose, noise cancelling headphones had a lot of static noise and didn't work on the right ear. I love that Senso lasts eight hours as I listen to White Noise or sleep music all night long to block out my hubby's snoring.  But, it only takes 90 minutes to fully recharge.  It's also easier to exercise with as the wire doesn't get caught up and I can put my phone in the pack when I ride my bike vs my pocket where it occasionally falls out.  Senso is also inexpensive enough to buy more than one pair so while one pair is charging I have another pair ready to go for my early morning exercise sessions. Next generation: waterproof for swimming please and a bit more noise canceling.

First Take at bluetooth headphones and I'm enjoying them.


Since Apple came out with their Air Pods, I've been looking to cut the chord. Just not interested in $160 to do that. So I took to Amazon and was completely surprised by the number of reviews the Senso Headphones received. So, at a $36 price point, you have to give them a shot.  I must say, like others, I'm surprised by the sound quality. Just enough but not too much bass (unlike Bose) and you don't need the volume cranked to hear. The headphones serve dual purpose, but mostly for calls at the office. I will say, it is nice to take walks around the office without a chord dangling on the phone.After having them a couple of days, the battery life is great and comfort is good. The only ""issue"" that I have is the strap. I wear collared shirts and a couple of people have asked what the noise was and it's coming from the strap. I'm also not sure that the noise cancelling works well since they can hear back ground noise.

Great Value, Great Sound, Comfortable, Worth the Price!


I purchased the Senso ActivBuds S-250 via Amazon.  I am very impressed with the sound quality and how comfortable they fit.  Excellent bass.  Very light.  Love the flexible over ear piece.  The noise cancellation works really well.  Easily my primary headphones for working out now.  It's hard to complain about a lack of features at this price range.  That said, my only complaints are that the unit does not indicate the current power level when the unit is powered on (audibly - Power Level Low, Power Level Medium, Power Level High, etc); and, there is no way to mix outside ambient noise into the mix (the noise cancellation works really good so stay alert while jogging outside).  Nice warranty.Note: I've owned several wireless headphones in this price range ($20-$40) primarily used for working out.  This pair is EASILY the best of the pack...BY FAR.Good job Senso!

Great product


UPDATE: Buds fit nicely into my ears and stay in place after taking the SENSO customer support advice.As some others have mentioned, the buds simply wouldn't stay in my ear and would just rest outside the ear canal (I tried all 3 different sizes of buds that are included). This basically deprives the sound of all bass and allows for outside sound to get in. I'd never be able to run in these as they would just fall out. The sound is great if I push them into my ear but then they just slide out. Maybe I have strange shaped ears, who knows. They seem to be working out fine for other people. UPS is picking them up tomorrow to be returned.

So just received my headphone would like to say from the start handsdown the best ines I have ever had, I like the fact that you get a power cord and car charger include and the nice carrying case in it self is so nice, so sound quality perfect I only have to use level 3 to stop all the outside chatter. The tips that it came with fit bit only down fall that I already knew was the ear pience that loop around your ear they are not able to be fitted to your ear no deal breaker since they stay in place pretty well, but like I said just got them out the box oh yeah the outside box preset cool also.

Great bass, but impossible to keep in my ear.


Surprisingly great value for the price. Battery is great as is the quality of the sound. The red ear inserts are pretty much earplugs and do a great job of passively blocking outside noise.Surprisingly amazing Bass (I’m a SVS home theater dude) for theses little earphones. But they keep falling out of my ears a little  when lying back to do sit-ups or running. They stay in your ear, but the sound drops in that ear and the bass goes away leaving an irritating un-balance of the music  between each ear.

Do not sit in ear during intense activity


Just purchased, and now returning. I am constantly frustrated by the lack of affordable headphones for runners. For the last few years I've been using Plantronics Backbeat Fit - my last set finally died, so I decided to try a cheaper alternative. These flimsy things do not sit in the ear at all, despite coming with three size buds. The ""around the ear"" lugs are too flexible to offer any significant support. The chord needs to come out the back of the unit, not the bottom, otherwise the chord pulls on the ear piece. If you are not being active with these, they are probably fine, but they are not marketed as such, and thus a waste of money IMO.

You have to get a pair for yourself


These headphones are the best ones ever. Simple to pair, & they look & feel great on. The sound is better than all the rest that I own & have tried. They are better than somme costing hundreds more & are well worth the price. I have a half dozen sets but by far these are the ones I keep using time after time. You can't go wrong getting a pari for yourself. This is the best way that customers can let other shoppers know how a product works & by far these are the best on the Amazon market.

I really like these. I just bought a brand new pair after i accidentally broke my first pair. I did like the ear piece of the original pair though. The part that wraps around your ear on the new ones is moldable with wire inside which makes it harder for me to just quick slide them on. I prefer  the older ear piece.

I had been in the market for a new set of Bluetooth headphones for quite awhile, and finally, after reading all of the reviews, decided to pull the string and order the SENSO headphones.  There was a delay in receiving the delivery...no fault of SENSO, but the customer service team helped identify problem & provide direction as to how to remedy the situation.  I received my delivery the next business day.  The quality of the product, carrying case and ancillary supply was far better than I expected.  The set-up/pairing of the headphones to my girlfriends iPhone was very simple.  The sound quality, intuitive design and comfort has for an initially positive buying experience.  I like them so much, I plan on purchasing a second set for myself!

I am extremely dissapointed in this product. I thought it was so amazing that I bought a pair as a gift for Christmas for a relative. These were given to my husband when I purchased them as a gift, however shortly after he got BEAT headphones and no longer needed them so they have not been used much. He gave them to me to start using at the gym, I've used them ONCE since and now they don't want to charge at all. Now I'm thinking I should return the ones we got my brother in law since he hasn't opened them yet. So disappointing.

Sounds great and stays in place


had purchased another brand of wireless headphones a month earlier, but was not happy due to the fact that the sound sucked and they would not stay in my ears if I ran or even turned my head while working out.  Got these yesterday and wore them to work out this morning.  Couldn't be happier.  Stayed in my ears the entire time and did not pull out when I moved my head.  the sound was fantastic as well.  highly recommend these if you need a pair of wireless headphones when you workout.

Overall this is a really good product. I sometimes have some issues keeping the earbud portion in my ear but once they’re in, usually I’m good. The sound quality is good and the battery lasts a good while. The only think I don’t like is the the connected cord has a crimp in it from being boxed and tends to crimp up behind my neck while I’m running which is annoying. I’m trying straighten the cord over time by handing from the arm of a chair...we’ll see.

The headphones were great, i only used it for when i went to the gym and honestly it was a great little product. But then after a few months it wouldn't charge at full capacity only up to 20% and even then it would die within 5 -10 minutes.The headphones are basically non-functioning now but i will give it 2 stars since they worked well when it did and maybe i just received a defective one.

Initial quality assessment


I bought these because of the reviews and ratings. I figured it was a safe gamble given the low cost, and so far it seems to be a big winner.The pictures make it look like you have some rather bulky plastic things on your ears, and honestly they are a bit ungainly, but so are most of the wireless earbuds on the market, so no big knock against these. Fortunately, they feel extremely light and barely noticeable. Some vigorous head shaking (to simulate running) couldn't shake them loose. I don't normally like the earbud style, but these seem pretty solid with the extra security of the soft silicone ear hooks.Sound quality seems great to my unsophisticated ear. I lowered the volume compared to my wired Yurbuds.Pairing with the phone was easy once you know which button did what. Reconnecting after powering back on was flawless as well.Unless they fall apart in the first month, I'm sticking with the 5 star rating.

Watch out from what you’ve seen/heard before


I agree with previous reviewers. I have bought these headphones numerous times since I have a tendency to lose. However, the pair I most recently received is NOT the same. The main headphone part is now hollow, cheap plastic as opposed to the more comfortable rubber from all previous pairs.Furthermore, when turning on/off, the voice in the headphones is extremely loud and that doesn’t seem to be able to be adjusted. Pretty disappointing in this pair and won’t be ordering again when I do eventually lose (which may happen sooner than later for a reason).

So I got this for my husband's birthday and within one week he said the sound went out in one ear. Soon after our twins were born and ended up in the NICU so it got too hectic to return them. Not sure if it's just a fluke or if the quality is really that bad. My husband hadn't gotten them wet or even sweated with them. He didn't even use them enough to know how the battery holds up for the long haul. Very disappointing.

These are literally the best bluetooth headphones I've ever used. I was amazed by the price and the quality. I've had these for several years now, and use them anytime I'm running or working out at the gym. They don't slide out of my ears, regardless of how sweaty I get, or if it's raining outside.

Good quality. Tough as nails.


I had bought these March of 2018 in order to have BT headphones that had a battery life of more than 2 hrs (compared to little individual buds) and the price was decent. I've loved them every since and now over a year later, they are finally beginning to wear out after a ton of use including drops, being stepped on (repeatedly), tugged on by kids, tangled up, thrown around, drenched in sweat, ect. (and run over by a car once...)The casing around the main button popped off fairly early in, but a little tape and it holds just fine. The inner circuits and cord are tough as nails though which easily makes up for it. Sound quality is decent for the size, and it works well for taking phone calls in noisy environments or if you just need to be hands free. I use them for a few hours sporadically throughout the day so I can go a couple of days before I have to charge them again which is nice. Definitely buying from Senso again.

I bought these headphones on May 14th and sound quality I thought was amazing. However,  today they just completely stopped working after being fully charged.  I'm hoping that's company stands behind that product and will replace these under warranty.  I would have given these headphones at least four and a half stars but since they just died I'm only ready needs at 2 for now.After posting a review on this product I called their customer service department and received a very prompt response and action.  I'm big on customer service and if your service is top notch but the product just average I would automatically give the product a higher rating based on the service.  In this case,  these head phones sounded great while they were working and couple that with prompt service, I had to revised my rating from a 2 star to a 4.5 star rating.  These head phones by far sound way way better than others I tried in the past.Thank you Senso for standing behind your product..

Durable, but microphone and sound quality leave something to be desired


Earphones are solid, waterproof as advertised, and have good batter life. Sound quality however, is not that great.  There is way too much bass, and you have to use the equalizer to reduce it to make music listenable. But once you reduce the bass, the quality when listening to music is not bad. Call quality can't be helped, since you can't equalize call audio. The biggest issue, however, is the microphone. Since the mic is inside the earpiece, it has trouble picking up your voice, and sometimes the other person can hear themselves talk.

I have had these headphones for nearly a year and they finally show some wear in the worst way.What I like:Compact, comfortable, mostly good sound and pretty good mic especially for the price.I primarily used these headphones during runs and gym activity.  They've been good with sweat and the only real issue I had were when the audio would get messed up when too close to metal walls.What I don't likeThe chord that tethers the headset together.  if rubbed can but not always will disrupt the sound, this happened rarely when running with a hoody but thats negligible.I don't know how often this happens to other users but I've had these for almost a year and the chord that tethers the headset is failing.  it looks fine but my left earbud is failing.  I don't know where to find a warranty clause on Amazon for Senso but I know their website says it has a 1-year warranty on this product.  If I can get my headset repaired or replaced I will gladly change my review to 5 stars if not, well $34 for a wireless bluetooth headset that lasts a year wasn't too bad.

WAY too big; hook over ear also NOT adjustable - do NOT waste your time & money!


I, too, have small ear canals, and researched earphones and earbuds carefully before purchasing these.  I had tried several cheaper products over the years, and nothing will either fit into, or stay in my ears.  These are no different.  They are so huge that they just fall out before I even can get them in - even with the smallest size earpad. And the hook over the ear is way too big as well, and is NOT adjustable, which is pretty ridiculous.  I am SO disappointed! I have my first 5K walk this weekend, and really needed these, but now do not have anything.  So I will be making a forced shopping trip out of town to try and find yet another pair that, hopefully, will stay in my ears - again.  If you have small ears, do NOT waste your money on these - mine are going back!

Not for Running


Initially out of the box everything was perfect.  I bought them to run with.  On my first run, I noticed I could hear the wind passing over the earpieces and it over took the sound of the speakers.  I tried ever set of ear pieces they provided and there was no improvement.  If you want them for the gym, they are perfect.  If you expect to run with them outside and there is even the slightest breeze you will be very disappointed in them.  I am returning them.  Honestly it sounded the same as when you are on the interstate and you roll your windows down.  That's how much the wind affects these speakers.

If you forget to charge things, don't buy these.


I've owned these headphones for several months now, bought a pair for myself and the wife.Pros:CheapDurable (didn't seem to have any trouble with water; it took going through a washer/dryer cycle to kill them, whoops)Decent sound quality (esp. given the price)Cons:The headphones give you about a 5 minute warning when the battery is about to die; countless times I'd be mid-run and they'd start dying, giving me an annoying reminder every 30 seconds that the battery was low before shutting offConnection can be weak; when first connecting these via bluetooth each time, it typically takes about 10-15 seconds to get a solid connection/sound output.I'll be honest, my biggest issue is the stupid battery warning. That may not be as big of a thing to some people, so if it doesn't matter to you, it's a good buy.

I bought these headphones to replace a pair of Taotronic earbuds I had lost. First off the sound quality was less than I hoped it would be, but by no means bad. With such high reviews I just expected a little more.I've owned three different sets of bluetooth headphones/earbuds and I have to say these were the worst at keeping a signal. For example I used to be able to leave my phone in my room and roam the house with very few places where I would lose signal, and these could barely make it to the hallway, let alone say the kitchen. But the real kicker was the first time I took them out on a workout. If I put my phone in my left pocket while wearing these, just moving my leg would be enough for the signal to cut in and out.Now with those complaints, why give it three stars even? Well, if I was playing by ""its"" rules, as in keeping the phone in areas closer, or in the opposite pocket, they worked just fine. Not really any complaints. But it has gotten to the point where it's just enough of an annoyance I am looking into other brands.

not a good fit


The good:1) Sound is good. I'm not an audiophile but it is good enough for me.2) It is really sweat proof.3) The wires do not get entangled or bounce around while exercising.The bad:1) The connection keeps dropping when I pair it with my Sony mp32) The hooks refuse to stay in place.3) The buds also refuse to stay in place.I spend a good 5-10 minutes adjusting the hooks and it still doesn't stay snugly in my ear. The buds refuse to stay in, regardless of earbud size. The hooks keep ""floating in air"", for lack of a better description. Granted, it doesn't drop off and drape around my shoulders; it's just that the fit isn't good so the buds feel as if they're floating just beside my ears.I really wanted to use it for exercise, but it just won't fit well. I've downgraded it to music listening while working on the computer and even so, I spend the first 5 mins adjusting the hooks.

Do not like the new over-the-ear hook changes


I've bought these earbuds on at least 3 separate occasions. The last two times were because I either lost them or an earbud stopped working. The sound quality is decent, great for the price of the earbuds. I cannot compare these with another of the same price range, but I can say they do come with everything you need and some extras like new inserts. Each time I got a new pair of these, they had little differences. My newest pair has over-the-ear hooks that you can mold to your ear. This has caused more problems than solutions, whereas the other hooks that weren't malleable would fit a lot more snug and quicker. However, once you get done fiddling with your earbuds they will stay tightly in place until you have to take them off, making you re-do the process when you put them on again. These earbuds are perfect for the gym, jogs, and just walking around.

Doesn't fall out, good audio quality, excellent headphones even compared to more expensive alternatives.


This is the first ever customer review I have ever filled out.Normally I am too busy to take the time to go back and say what I think of things I buy. I have to say though these headphones are absolutely amazing. I use them all the time. I am a college student and I would say I have them in my ears probably 4 to 5 hours a day. The audio quality is fantastic to the point that I used them with my computer because the sound is so much better on the headphones then the computer's speaker. Additionally, I use them whenever I work out. I have gone through 3 other pairs of blue tooth headphones trying to find a pair that stays in my ears, has good audio quality, and blocks sound to a degree, and some of the previous headphones I bought cost almost $100. These are far better. I have gotten my dad hooked on them as well, he is a DJ and is always picky about audio quality. If I was to give any criticisms of the buds it would be that the charging port cover is very hard to open and I ended up removing it. Additionally the battery wears down rather quickly (although I typically get through the day). Highly recommend.

The best most comfortable fit!


Great sound, battery life and fit for the price. The best feature of these headphones are the ear hooks! They are soft and pliable but not too soft that they don't stay on. The other headphones that I have that have this kind of configuration have ear hooks that have much harder plastic which results in less give. Because of the stiffness the other headphones will start hurting the back of my ears after an hour of wearing them so I'd have to say that these have been the best out of the four different models of headphones that I own.Their customer service is excellent too. They were super responsive when I had a problem with the left earphone and were able to ship me out a new one right away.

So the good news is that the battery seems to last a long time, I haven't exactly measured how long but they last while I listen to brain.fm for 6 hours at night, about 2 hours of podcast per day and they charge family quickly less than 2 hours.So the bad whenever I go into play a podcast, video, instagram video or headspace a second before the sound comes on I can now hear a slight static sound and now I can hear it over the meditation or podcast and it is driving me insane.So I am looking for a new pair and can not recommend these because of that.

Look no further for wireless earbud headphones!


Like many others who have gave reviews, I too have tried multiple brands of wireless headphones. I think I finally found a pair that is going to work. The Senso headphones have outstanding sound quality and are very comfortable and very easy to use.  Something I didn't expect was to also receive two free charging cords as well as a dual car adapter and a very nice case to store them in. I have only had them for about a week but  I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend the Senso headphones to everyone who is considering getting a pair of wireless earbuds !!

Good value for money


Hard to beat for the price. Comfortable fit, especially with the foam earpiece tips fitted, and adequate sound quality (although a bit heavy on the bass). Battery life and charge time seem good, although I haven't used them for more than a couple of hours at a stretch. They stay on the ear well during moderate exercise.Some wind noise if you're using them on a walk or run, and there's the occasional moment of lost connection. The controls on the earpiece are also a bit unreliable, pressing the volume up or down buttons without enough time between them can cause them to stop playing and they occasionally seem to lose the Bluetooth connection - this might be operator error, though. Build quality is adequate, although I doubt they would stand up to rough treatment.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. If you want excellent sound quality, active noise cancellation, or superb features you would need to look elsewhere... and probably spend a lot more money, too. But as decent everyday Bluetooth headphones, that will stay with you while you workout, these are a good choice.

The microphone is completely useless outdoors; any minimal amount of wind will lead to interference.Final: You get what you pay for. These are okay for gym headphones, and worth the price if you want cordless headphones for working out.

Had difficultly pairing with iPad but quick response from company. Love them.


Love, love, these earphones.  Sound quality is wonderful. They fit nicely in the ear and are comfortable.  At first I had trouble getting them paired with my iPad.  They worked wonderful with the iPhone but could not get them to work with iPad.  I wrote the company via email and in about 10 minutes I had the response and easy solution.Now I'm all set to using them daily.  They came with a nice carry case and charge cord.  Quick to set up to use with a good eight hours of use before I need to recharge.

They don't sit in ear very securely.


Heavy on the ears and they have not been staying in place with moderate movement. I wouldn't dare use them while jogging as they barely stay in while mowing the grass. Every few steps reaching up and pushing them back into my ears. Sound is good, they connect reliably so far. Considering the price of other bluetooth headphones they are a bargain and a good place to start but they are less than great for running exercise. Would do if you are weight training though.

Best buds out


Holy moly.These earbuds are louder than ANY I have ever owned. I use them to ride a vstar with custom pipes and I can barely hear the pipes.I give these a 5+. They are the real deal. I have never heard of the brand, but they rival, compete with, and sound as good as drs beats. The price is unbelievable.High quality sound for a crazy low price. You can hear the base, tremble, and voice on these. They have a warranty and all the high end aspects, a case, car charger, pc cables, extra ear rubbers. They made me a believer, check um out, you won't be disappointedDocc

Fabulous!


The headphones have a great volume and the sounds with bass are heard perfectly. In addition, they have the possibility to change the music track with a single tap. They feel comfortable and light when using them. Also, it is only necessary to answer the incoming call from your cell phone to be able to speak for the headsets without having to do anything else. They are better than the Beats I had previously. I bought an extra pair for a gift and they loved it.

Great Price


Love that they have the 8 hour battery life. I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas who is constantly listening to podcasts while at work, and thought he'd like the wireless aspect. I ended up needing a white elephant gift for my office party so I wrapped them up for that instead and they turned out to be the most desired gift! So, I bought another pair for my boyfriend and also a pair for my friend's boyfriend. Hopefully they hold up but for the price, you can't beat them.

Too much Bass--Not enough trebile.


If you are looking for a low priced semi-decent sound quality BT earbuds then give them a try.  After years of running with wires I decided to give wireless a try.  Set up was easy and I had no problems with connectivity.  The problem soles im with the sound. They have WAY too much bass for me and not nearly enough trebile. Unfortunately there isn't a way to adjust this. For some it might be ok but for me I'm going to have to spend the extra $$ on a better pair. Hope this helps steer some of you in the right direction!

Differ from pair to pair


I got these in August and after having them for only a little more than a month connecting them has become impossible. Just have to keep trying over and over - takes at least 5 minutes to connect every time. This pair has a super loud ""Connected"" and ""Disconnected"" voice for some reason - no way to turn it down or figure out why. Last, on this pair the ear hooks are so uncomfortable. Last pairs were flexible and wrapped easily around ears, until last pair became overly flexible and wouldn't stay on at all.  I missed the return cutoff by a week so now I'm out $30 because I have to get something else.

Good quality product with nice sound.


I'm really quite impressed with the headphones. The sound is nice, the noise cancellation is quite good. The only minor complaint I have (and it's very small) is that I wish the cord connecting the two headphones was an inch, maybe two, longer. I have a big head, doncha know. ;) (And even that probably isn't a real problem - it may just be the fact that I haven't used the cord enough for it to straighten out from when it was in the packaging.) Definitely a product worth purchasing.

Not bad for the price, when they work


Didn't last two months. Easy to use, acceptable battery life. When they worked, the sound was decent, but not great. Not terrible headphones for the price if they lasted longer, but they stopped working completely on their own. The right speaker stopped working and I thought they just needed a charge, so I charged them, not even a light. They came with a nice case, charging cable, and 3 different size ear bud sets, but none of them would actually stay in my ear while doing simple exercises, which drove me nuts. The behind-the-ear piece is so floppy it serves no purpose. Looks like I'll be trying a different pair.

BEST wireless earbuds deal you can get


This is my second pair of these earbuds. I used my first set five days a week, for work shifts lasting 8-9 hours, and they lasted about three years.  Three years!  And they never fell apart and only ever ran out of battery life when going on ten hours.  Charge them up for an hour or two and they'll last you all day.  I've tried other wireless earbuds and keep going back to these because for the price these are unbeatable.  Highly recommend!!!

Didn't work for me


First It didn't fit into my ears and the wire ear-hookers were soft which didn;t keep the ear buds on the position, I wrote to them about this problem, their rep told me to change the ear rubber pieces. I did it , but the hook wires were so soft. Every times I turned my head (I wore prescription glasses), it dropped off many times. I owned many brands, such as Tao, Phaiser, Cowin, ... This is the first product I didn't like it. I wonder the reviews for this product were real. It didn't work for me.

Amazing customer service!


Okay, clearly this is a review for the headphones but honestly, one thing that gave this product 5 stars is their excellent customer service and there is nothing better than buying a product and knowing that merchant will take care of any question, comment, or concern that you might have and this company definitely excels at it and deserve to be acknowledged for it. But other than that, these headphones are probably the greatest headphones you can get at such a reasonable price. The quality is superb, I can barely hear myself speak and definitely excel in the low to mid ranges to give you really good bass. The look and setup is simple and nice and sleek and overall an amazing product. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for incredible headphones at a resonable price with amazing customer service.

Only lasted a year - then started to go in and out - eventually died from water


They worked great for the first year.  After that they would go in and out when I ran when my hand would go down.  Assuming it was the Bluetooth connectivity.  When that started happening, I decided to test out the waterproof rating which it claims it has. IPX7 is for 3 meters or less for 30 minutes or less.  I swam for 10 minutes never going more than two feet deep and they busted on the first lap.  They were already busting so I am not too sad about it.  DO NOT BUY if you plan on swimming or need long term earbuds.

$200 Quality for less than $50


Ok so this review is from a fresh out of the box owner. I read all of the reviews both good and bad and thought what the heck im going to try these out. I have been a loyal Plantronics Bluetooth owner for 10 years ever since i bought my first voyager headset. But straight out of the box these were the easiest headset that i have ever had to pair with.At first i wasn't sure if I would like the design of the headset but once i put it on they were light and comfortable and no matter how i shake my head they are not moving.When it comes to sound i like a variety of music so i started right off with a good EDM Playlist and they didnt fail to meet expectations. The sound isn't as rich as im certain some of the high dollar headsets sound, but it sounds 100x better than previous mid range sets i have owned.I look forward to seeing what the battery life will be like. If they were consistent when it came to the quality in the design im certain they wont disappoint.

I'd love to love them and keep them but


I have a problem with this... I'd love to love them and keep them but, the power of the BT reach is too weak. I mean, you cant go into the next room without losing connection. Yesterday, on my way to the GYM I put my phone under my armpit and the BT set disconnected. Sorry, but I need something with a little more reach and power. Sound it's OK, but don't expect too much. I use my BT to listen to Audio books and movie reviews on YouTube and that's ok for that.

Make them fit properly


I like the sound quality, the bass can only be improved by proper ear canal fitting.The over the ear hooks are comfortable and functional. I am not a fan of rubber ear tips,sweat from exercising can pop them out of place,  I prefer the foam. It comes with a set.Blue tooth seems to work OK, Can't comment on battery life yet. The workmanship is good be careful there isa weak point between the speaker and the body of the electronics. Handle with care.

Don't waste your money, buy LG or better known brand.


It comes with a lot of accesories. The sound quality is not the best but it is good enough for 19 bucks. Whenever I moved my head to the right the sounds cut or if I put it in the pocket of my jacket or some other random situation. Other than that worked fine. I would gladly return it but yesterday, it open up the right side of the headset. I found the cover at the floor in my room but I lost the volume control. I didn't hit it, that is why I didnt realize when It open up. Don't waste your money, I have given a chance to unknown brands in the past but this is the first time I see such a bad product. Again, it is just 19 bucks but still. Psdt: It is kind of painful after an hour wearing it.

These are great headphones at a great price.  I was looking for headphones to workout with that paired w my Apple Watch.  After reading all the good reviews I landed on these.  They can’t be beat for the quality at the price. They come with a case, multiple ear bud sizes and other extras. After using them one time I went home and ordered a set for my wife.

Seller won't stand behind it; doesn't last past 8-10 months...


At first I really liked this product.  Ordered additional for friends and family as presents.  The sound started fading in an out and one ear didn't work after a few months.  Contacted the seller and they assured me ""they would take care of it”but asked that I try resetting it.  This worked for a few weeks and then the problem resurfaced.  I recontacted them and now they say its out of the warranty period and won't stand behind their product.  Frustrating but you get what you pay for I guess.  Just beware that these will work well for some time but be prepared to buy new ones after a year.  Not bad I guess for $30.

Highly recommended!! I have a pair of Beats headphones and bought these as a second pair. They are pretty damn good. Sound and battery life are great. The quality of the product is about the same as Beats. They are little bigger on your ear though. Good thing about these headphones, they don’t have a controller on the wire so the wire doesn’t slide to the heavier/controller side like Beats -stretching your headphone in the ear.

Great product!


Just did my first workout with these headphones. The sound quality is great, and they really do block out a lot of background noise. The earpieces are comfortable, and did not bounce around or move throughout my workout.Comes with its own carrying case as well as car charger which is perfect for charging on the way to the gym. The charger also connects to USB, so it can be plugged into a cube and charged on the wall as well.Overall great product so far, no real complaints. Although I'm not a huge fan of the over the ear piece, but only because I don't like the look of anything over the ear. The piece itself is very flexible and much more comfortable than other in the ear headphones that have over the ear pieces like this. Helps to keep headphones in place, and does not irritate after a while of being in place.Would recommend!

I have been using the wireless headphones for a week now. I wear them when I go running in the morning, I wear them at the gym and I wear them around the house to block out the t.v. If I'm not interested in what my husband is watching. The quality is very durable, the range is as stated and comfortable to wear. I put my phone in my gym bag nearby and I sure don't miss the wires. I could not believe the quality of the product at such an affordable price. I was apprehensive when I ordered them and pleased I made the choice when I received them.

Meh...They don't properly fit on my ears, there's a gap at the top of my ears.And for the music quality... it feels like the sound is coming from the back of my head. I don't know how to explain it, but you know the ""like you're at the concert"", rich sound feeling you get with good headphones? Yeah that's missing.. The sound depth is missing. Feels like it's coming from a distance.Also the bass is soooo freaking loud, and I'm someone who usually turns up the bass few bars when I listen to music, that I turn it allll the wayy downn!! It's insanely high for me!I should've returned them when I got them and buy a different brand. I thought it's just me, but should've followed my intuition because I've been feeling this way since I first tried them on. I'm sensitive about good quality music but didn't wanna spend a lot of money.But other than my above problems, it has been working fine. Oh also, no sound blocking if that's what you're looking for.

For the price, you can't beat these wireless headphones.  My boyfriend uses them.  He says the base is awesome and sound quality is good overall.  The only downside to these headphones is the way it sits in his ear.  He says they keep falling out.

Got mine on sale on prime day, I really like them. A few weeks prior I bought a different cheaper Brand pair(it was like $12) had literally no base and the battery didn't last very long. These have lots of base, are very comfortable, battery is great, and have way better build quality. To top that if you get a 2 charge cables(a regular short one and a larger one with with 2 heads on it for android or iPhone), a sturdy case, and a car charger with 2 USB ports. You also get the different sized ear plug things. It was an absolute steal on sale, definitely worth the regular price.

I didn't want to break the bank for a pair of workout earbuds. I didn't want to sacrifice quality either. These did not disappoint. I just received these last week and I've had these with me at all times. Great sound and great fit for running and gym time.

Bluetooth headset feature is great as well as I've had no complaints from all my calls and I can hear them very clearly as well. Distance from phone is pretty good as well-- I've tested about 15feet with no issues. I'm not going into too much detail anymore since there are already 20k+, 5-star ratings for these headphones.

Slippery When Wet!


The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are a good value. There is no doubt about that. But there are definitely some pro's and con's that made me rethink this purchase. When I was looking for headphones, my number one concern was if it would stay firmly in my ear without having to readjust. Second, was the quality of sound. Third, was the Bluetooth connection With the SENSO Bluetooth headphones, this is what I found to be the case...The PROs: Quality sound, good button functionality, and surprisingly comfortable.The CONS: (the major one) when you start to sweat the silicone ear hook does not keep tight to your ear resulting in slippage and bouncing, Bluetooth disconnects from my iPhone after about a minute (so if you pause your music for any reason expect that you will have to reach for your phone to sync the two devices up again).I am still not sure I am going to keep them. I have to take off the headphones to wipe the silicone ear hooks off about 4-6 times over an hour workout.

So far so good. I got them in two days and immediately started charging them. They were super easy to pair and sound great. I was really surprised by the noise canceling. Also, very happy with the different sizes for the inserts because I couldn’t fit the medium or large in my ears. The features are very easy to use. It comes with a 30 day return policy and you can register for a one year warranty. I will say it will be hard to get used to having something shoved in my ear but I will find out.

Great headphones but I wish it had a better battery


Got mine in November 2016, so I've had them for about 10 months.  Sound is fantastic and they are extremely comfortable and very easy to use.  The microphone sound is very clear, and I have sync'd with my computer, an Iphone 6, 6s, and a 7.  I'm giving it four stars for two reasons: (1) The battery life is not great.  I travel quite a bit, and the headphones start dying between 4 and 5 hours.  That's barely airport and flight time.  (2) Not Noise canceling.  Trust me, it does not cancel noise.  It says ""passive"" noise canceling, and if it is, its VERY passive.  Other than that, I don't think you can do much better for $33.

Don't recommend


Bought this mostly for around the house when doing chores like cleaning the yard and so on. I have Samsung S8 and for whatever reason the headphones kept cutting in and out. I have tried other wireless headphones and haven't had that issue. I bought another pair of these, and the same thing kept happening. Besides that the sound quality is pretty bad below average for what I'm used to. Even for the price (which is low) I don't recommend, spend the extra money and get some good sounding headphones. You do get what you pay and this is no different.

Getting what you paid for


Constant static in the Bluetooth connection if you touch your earbuds buds to adjust the volume or change song it would break up.Use these on an 8 Mile Run and constantly kept having to put them back in my ear the over-the-ear connection was so weak it would not hold them in place. With the reviews the earbuds received on Amazon I was hoping for a lot more. Return them for a refund.

Comfortable earbuds.


I purchased these to replace a near identical set that had a different name, but they are all China made so no big surprise. Tried them for the first time yesterday and they worked the same as well. They shipped fast in a fancy box with a few extra free items I don't know if I will use. The last ones lasted almost 2 years, hopefully these will do at least that well. They sound good and are comfortable to wear. I will report back if any issues develop.

They have their pros and cons...


Don' let the 3 star rating turn you away, I just am not that fond of them. They just don't fit my head / ears and are kind of heavy, and tend to slide off when hanging around my neck, even under light movement.On the other hand, they are LOUD! They have pretty deep bass response, almost too much for me! They connect quickly and easily, and have an AMAZING battery life in comparison to most other devices I have used.

Fantastic


I wear these headphones a the office and to the gym. This product impressed me since it arrived in my mail. It came with a dual car USB charging adapter with a long charging cord which was compatible with iphone 6 and samsung charging ports. The headphones themselves came with a sturdy case, charging cord, and three different sizes of ear plugs. On the headphones themselves were foam ear plugs that mold really well to the ear. I ended up not using the foam plugs because I find it easier to sanitize the other plastic plugs. However, if I were to strictly use these for walking my dog or listening to music in the office, I would stick with the foam. They're excellent.The battery life is very long. I haven't timed exactly how long my usage is, because I turn them off and on in between uses. But I am able to use them through a work shift and then use them for 2 hours straight afterwords while I am at the gym. I have never been worried about these headphone dying on me during the day. I also am able to charge the quickly in my car if every other day during my commute to work.

Awesome Ear Buds!


These things are awesome. I sweat like crazy when i working out... i'm always used to having to deal with cheapy headphones going out after a few uses with them.When i first ordered these, I thought they did not come with a wire tie. I let the company know and they let me know it was inside the same back with ear buds (they're tiny) my fault for being in ID10T. great product and great service i would recommend these to anyone needing a good set of workout EarbudsThis has been a good experience

Terrific product and really good value


This reviewer' first stab at using bluetooth--and this product is great.  Am listening to a podcast (just discovered that bluetooth goes in and out when the microwave is on; interesting); excellent range of distance from audio source; they feel quite comfortable; easy to use.  Just walked dog while listening..hey! there's the phone ringing--just did call by bluetooth.  Definitely works for me!

Very Impressive!


I have to say I'm definitely impressed.  The headphones feel well made and have performed well.  I've put them to the test and even had them connected to two phones simultaneously - one for media and one for calls - and they've not missed a 'beat'.  At less than half the cost of what I usually pay for bluetooth wireless headphones, these are a great deal. Music and media sound good and they don't feel invasive or uncomfortable when I wear them all day.  These definitely stand up well to competitive more expensive brands.

Not the best bluetooth headphones I've used


Not the best bluetooth headphones I've used.The music often get choppy I guess because it's not really connecting? I don't know but my phone is only a foot away from me when I am at the gym. It also is not noise cancellation because I can still hear the gym's music when I have music playing from my earphones. I would still hear it unless I turn the music super loud.The back ear piece part does not really work well with my ears, but maybe that is just me.Tip: Not really good for running.

They work, I apologize for my previous comment


ok wait, I am terribly sorry for the angry review, I thought for the longest time while I was trying to get them on that the volume button was the multifunctioning button and it wasnt its actually on the side of the right earphone that turns on, turns off, and pairs. Sorry guys they work fine and are loud enough for me also very comfy :) thank you, for those who buy and recieve them the on/off pairing button is on the side on the right earphone just press and hold the S and it should work. The instruction manual totally made it seem like the volume buttons were the multifunctional button

These fit the bill for me...


These are comfortable earbuds, have good sound and noise blocking ability and joined easily to any of my blue tooth devices.  They came with three additional ear pad sizes as well as car charger with 2 USB ports and a USB iPhone charge cord.  It also has a nice zippered hard case to carry them in.I have used these a lot and just recently bought an additional pair to keep at the computer.  Everyone will judge things like this differently according to their own expectations, but I found them handy and reliable with good sound quality.

These headphones are well worth the amount paid.  They come with a car charger and a longer cord in addition to the short computer charging cord.  They hold their charge well and connect easily to my Iphone 7  The sound in the headphones is great, but, the only downside is that the people on the receiving end will say my voice is a bit fuzzy.  However, the sound they receive is a 100 percent better than the flash drive headphones that came with the Iphone 7. Oh yeah, in addition you will receive a very nice carrying case for the headset.

I found a pair of these in the smoke pit area in Qatar and when I tried them on they were so much better that BOSE or the BEATS.  In my opinion they do the same thing and snug on your ears.  They have adjustable ear pieces which is perfect for personnel that are active.  I love these headphones.  The only thing I wish is it had a longer time span instead of 8hrs.  but they still good

They're one notch above junk


I bought these about a year ago. The sound quality is decent but no bass and now power to it. They are a budget set of headphones. If you aren't willing to pay 100 plus for quality headphones then these can be a decent set for running and what not.. Anyway they are pretty cheaply made. I am writing this review because I just pulled them out of my pocket the other day and the power button somehow got pushed in and stuck. I tried to carefully pulled back out and all the innards came with it. TOAST!! What the heck happened to 30 dollar pairs of head phones that had great sound quality and lasted longer than you wanted?? There was a time.  But No more!!  It's either cheap shit or spend 150 dollars for quality. Just my two cents.

Strong Bass, great audio , very competitive price, buds feel bulky in the ear at first.


My only complaint is that they feel just a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to them. I got used to them within the first day but it would be nice if they could make the actual bud more comfy, it's a little hard and feels bulky in the ear. Having said that, the sound quality of these are OUTSTANDING, especially for the price. They are my new favorite headphones, The bass is very robust but in a way that does not  ruin the other sounds. I am very glad with my purchase. I would highly recommend this product for someone in the market for wireless headphones with strong bass .

features matters to me:can save pairing for 2 devices. I can pair this on my windows tablet and my android cellphone. switching devices requires you to manually connect to the bluetooth devices, on windows that is playback devices - right click bluetooth earphone - connect instead of going to bluetooth settings.battery is approximately 5 hours.sound quality was having some trouble at bass at first, then somehow fixed itself after charging. I'm no expert chasing that hifi quality, so this works fine.

Great headphones!


These headphones are well worth the buy. They sound clear and crisp. They don't have adjustable ear hooks which would be a big upgrade for the future. They have fantastic battery life and the foam ear tips are great for not only keeping the external sound out, but also, the volume does not have to be as loud due to the noise isolation.Bought as a cheap set to wreck and not feel bad if they get snagged on branches mowing, or ripped out when doing diy projects.They've surpassed every expectation and test.Haven't tested the waterproof functionality, but definitely sweat resistant.

amazing value.  I have a couple pairs of jaybirds, and they're good, too, BUT they would begin to slide out at some point while I was working out. And, it's usually pretty windy when I jog, and I found myself always reinserting them as i jogged every minute or so... these headphones obviously stay put bc of the clip around the ear and the quality is great.  i was surprised with how great the packaging was, too.  just wonderful quality all around.

Throw out your dr dre beats and buy these


let me start with the fact that I have a pair of Powerbeats, but have never been really impressed with them. The sound is mediocre at best, they are uncomfortable, and you can hear everything around you as though they aren't on.I bought these for my husband as an affordable alternative to beats and couldn't be more impressed. The sound is spectacular and they are incredibly comfortable. The part that goes behind you ear is flexible and thus doesn't dig into the back of your ear. Least to say, the hubby is beyond happy and I wish I bought these instead of the beats first!!

These just arrived so I don't have long-term opinion on them yet. They are comfortable and sound good. The quality seems to be very good. One of the things I was drawn to was longer battery life because that was the one issue I've heard for the other products in this style. They are much less then some of the others yet quality is definitely not lacking. If anything i feel they are better then the leading brand that go for three times the price. I say get them at this price. I'll add if I find anything that changes my opinion. Great product and value. Thank you

I've had these bad boys for quite some time and they've held up. Shoot, these headphones have been through it all. From flights, to camping, kayaking, and running (from bugs of course lol).

I've had a couple of friends but these and they've thanked me for the recommendation.

Meh...


These didn't last long. They worked ok at first. The fit was questionable. In the ears was fine but the cord between is a tad long. It would catch from time to time on my skin and they'd pull out. That was manageable. The case was too soft. It's supposed to be a hard case. However, when I used it and put it in my pocket, the blue tooth still managed to turn itself on from just the pressure in my pocket (loose fitting work pants, but would tighten up little when I squatted or sat.) Finally, one of the ear pieces snapped in half. It's junk now.

Great headphones and even better customer service


I have had these headphones for about 3 months now and they are great.  The sound quality is really good and the Bluetooth connection to my phone is excellent as well.  I have not had any issues with the sound cutting out at all while I work out or while running.  The battery life is very good, I only have to charge it once a week or so.  As far as the customer service, they were fantastic.  I had an accident and the ear bud snapped off one side.  I sent an email to customer service and within 24 hours received an email back letting me know since I was within the warranty period my headphones would be replaced.  The representative I was interacting with was very helpful and very responsive.  I am very impressed with both the product and the support.  I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone.

Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday last year. He absolutely loved it and used it at work (he’s a drywaller). He was impressed with how long the battery lasted, usually for most of his work days or a few days in a row. He eventually lost them at a job so I bought him a second pair for Christmas this year. I had to spoil the surprise to prevent him from buying a new pair himself.Would definitely recommend!

Once, twice, three times they went defective.


I’m sad to report that I’m extremely disappointed in this purchase. It didn’t start out that way, i was actually very pleased in the beginning. So pleased, in fact i purchased a second pair for my boyfriend. Not long after my headphones completely died on me, even when i followed instructions and did a factory reset. Luckily it was covered under a one time replacement warranty, but then this pair crapped out on me, and to top it off so did my boyfriends pair AND his replacement pair. It’s on sale now, but originally i purchased these for $36 a pair. I’m extremely disappointed and feel like i got screwed. Like how could 4 pair of headphones just stop working out of no where? And right in the middle of a workout no less. Don’t chance it. Buy another brand.

Great product, great seller!


These earbuds have held up well during pretty intense workouts and have proven to be sweat resistant.  They fit well, don't fall out during a workout and have great audio quality.  In addition to the nice quality, I am giving this review 5 stars because of the great customer service this company has provided.  For some reason, my earbuds stopped working this week.  I emailed the seller explaining my problem, and they responded very quickly.  We tried to troubleshoot the issue with a couple of very easy steps.  When that did not work, they confirmed my replacement earbuds would be sent since it fell within the 1 year warranty.  I am very please with the product and the seller, and I will buy from them again.

Awesome Choice!!!


These are must buy headphones! Straight Out of the Box everything was so well organized and easy to understand to get it connected to my Samsung Note 5. One of the first things I noticed was how even well-designed the cigarette portable charger was along with the USB cable itself was so Innovative that they combined both the iPhone charging cable along with the micro USB cable together. Once my new headphones we're synced up with my phone the first thing I had to do was test the quality of audio, why was I Blown Away with how great the audio sounded. They produce Dynamic audio quality such as the highs and the lows we're on point not to mention the sound isolation drownded out all of the background noise at the soccer fields so I could enjoy my music. I took a brief run and noticed that the headphones did not slipper slide around on my ears they stayed perfectly fit and it was like not having anything on at all. I would highly recommend not spending a bunch of money for headphones that can produce the same quality and fit such as these ones. I am starting to fall in love with my new Bluetooth headphones, not to mention they actually look pretty cool.

Hands down best price, sound and customer service.


I must say that these headphones are the best I have ever bought. The price is reasonable and the sound is rich. They are easy to pair with my Bluetooth devices and held a charge for a long time. They weigh hardly anything and fit comfortably in my ears. Others I wore irritated my ears after a while. At times, I forgot I had these headphones on. On the down side, the headphones died after about 5-6 six weeks of daily use (wouldn't charge and therefore could not reset). I am confident this is an aberration. But even that failure had a happy ending which makes me want to continue to be a loyal customer. That is because, to my relief, they have an excellent customer service dept. Within days, through a few emails, I was guided through troubleshooting the problem and now have a new pair of headphones on the way. They have a 30-day money back guarantee and 1-year replacement warranty which they honored without argument or hesitation once it became clear there was nothing I could do to get the headphones working again. At 62 yrs. old, suffice it to say that I have come across chintzy products that came with horrible customer service. This is clearly an excellent product with a customer service dept. eager to make things right. I expect no further problems but know that if I should encounter one, this company will do the right thing. To me, that is equally important as product quality. Money is tight nowadays and I received a fine product for a reasonable price, a quick replacement and the peace of mind I am looking for.

They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!  When I leave them on my nightstand it takes a while to figure out which of half a dozen black cables are the right ones. Even white would be ok as only my iPhone has a white cord.

Poor bluetooth connection.


I have had so much trouble with these headphones. The problem is with the bluetooth connection. I've had these for 6 months, and since the beginning, getting a connection to my iPhone 6 has been problematic. If you turn on the power and hear in the headphones ""Connected"", you're not. No app recognizes the headphones either. then you go into settings and disconnect, reconnect, disconnect, reconnect to get the actual connection. You have to do this every time. Once connected, no problems. But i've final bought a replacement headphone to use.

Decent Headphones With Great Customer Service


I ordered the TaoTronic headphones before the Senso and I can confirm that the Seno headphones are much better. They fit comfortably while I do my workouts, even while I'm doing sprints. With the TaoTronic, I constantly found myself having to push them back into my ear since they slipped out so easily from jogging. The TaoTronic began to hurt after wearing them for a half hour or so. The sound quality is also better than the TaoTronic as well. They pair quickly to my cell phone. The bluetooth radius isn't far though and I do wish the battery life was much better. But honestly for the price, it's a good headphone. I also appreciate the accessories that come with it such as the case. I recently had an incident with my headphones where the back came off. I contacted Senso about it and got a reply within 5 mins! They provided such friendly customer service and are sending me a replacement within a few days! You're not only getting decent pair of headphones but a great group of people working to improve your customer experience.

Solid construction


Until our first pair got accidentally broken these worked great.  A couple of issues with the pairing and dying,but coming back to life in the beginning.  Then it was okay until a zipper got the cord.  Customer Service from Invotek was great to work with, but they couldn't do more than give a discount.  The new pair arrived and the foam ear bud parts broke very quickly.  Disappointing since they were super comfortable. If it weren't for that I'd give it a 5 star review.

I had the SoundPal before this and they were great for reception but the plastic casing was so flimsy ...


These are just awful for reception in NYC. The first time I ran with them the sound kept cutting out. Then they would cut out for entire blocks in Manhattan. Now they have cut out permanently. I bought them mid-June. No matter what I have tried in terms of factory resetting, turning on/off etc. The plus is that they are one of the only headphones that I have found that fit in the ear and let you exercise. It appears that there are a number of headphone companies out there that all knock off one another for this particular style and price range.  I had the SoundPal before this and they were great for reception but the plastic casing was so flimsy that the case eventually fell apart when I tried to recharge. (These no longer seem available, but they were almost identical to these in look and fit.)  I will probably try one of the other brands since you can do that when you only spend 30 some odd bucks but totally frustrating. I would rather they upped the price by 20 dollars and made a decent pair of headphones.

Unimpressed


I got these for the gym based on a ton of great reviews, pair with the price, which seemed like too good of a deal to pass up. I've never been thrilled by the in ear style Ear buds, as they never seem to stay in very well, and are just uncomfortable. These were no exception, unfortunately. My real issue though, is that they sounds like crap. I've never scrutinized headphones I buy for gym use that hard for their sound. In fact, I've always been pretty happy to use the freebie earbuds that come with your iPhone. The only reason I made the jump to wireless is that Apple got rid of the jack, and I like having multiple sets of headphones available. (One in the car, one in a travel bag, etc). These headphones sound muffled and not crisp at all. If I'd have spent $170 on these, I'd have returned them the next day. I still may.

Otherwise these are nice. Stay in your ears and have pretty good ...


Just a clarification. These ARE waterproof BUT THEY DO NOT PLAY UNDERWATER when using bluetooth. They will stop and then when you comeback to the top they will play again. Otherwise these are nice. Stay in your ears and have pretty good sound quality. But since I was getting them for swimming these are not what I wanted. Tried a bunch of different set ups and yes I am always within 5 feet of the iphone I am using with bluetooth. Have a tether pool and this doesn't have any sound when the just dip below the surface. Maybe bluetooth doesn't work that way I don't know but not what I wanted.

Great product, great value


I’m so happy to finally find a pair of headphones that don’t fall out of my ears when I’m working out and start to get sweaty (sorry tmi). It did take a while and a lot of trial and error to figure out how to properly “install” them in my ears for the first few times but once you get the hang out it they are awesome! My one complaint is that after wearing them for a few hours (which doesn’t happen too often) my ears have started to get a little sore holding them in. I was worried they would be too bulky but it hasn’t seemed to be an issue! Love the easy commands and phone control through the earbuds.

it's great. I don't talk when while running and when ...


I have had two Beats wireless and they couldn't hold up to me running (sweat and humidity). Not wanting to cash out big bucks on another expensive pair that might stop working again, I bought these. Very impressed with sound quality and mic. The mic does pick up sound heavily (Beats not as bad), but for the amount I use the phone, it's great. I don't talk when while running and when using them inside the sound quality is great on both ends regarding the . Battery life is excellent, too. The button to disconnect is in a awkward place for me when I need to readjust while running or moving around and that's my only problem so far. I believe it's due to me being used to using Beats and having to get used to these. I would recommend to anyone looking at more expensive sports buds.

Excellent Wireless Earbuds!


I bought the first pair of these earbuds for my son, who is selective in what he uses, and he LOVES them! So I ordered a second pair for my daughter! She too is very happy with them. The earpiece is soft and flexible and keeps the ear buds in place nicely. My son says that they do a great job cancelling out other noise. For the price, they are amazing and rival more expensive brands. I highly recommend the SENSO Bluetooth headphones! I also recommend this seller, who was fast with delivery and everything was packaged well!

Would buy again


Bought these headphones to use both at the gym as well as to take conference calls on my cell phone.  The headphones worked great for both purposes, they fit comfortably.  Couldn't ask much more from a comparably priced headset.  The microphone was incredibly sensitive, which did lead to some feedback issues for those that I was talking to on the phone, but this was resolved by turning the volume down on the headphones.  The headphones worked great until recently, when they stopped pairing with my phone.  I contacted Senso as they were still within the 1 year warranty period, and after unsuccessfully trying to troubleshoot the problem, they sent me a new set.  I would definitely buy from this company again.

They sound good and were easy to pair with my phone. UPDATED - Tough as nails!!!!


So far I am loving these. They sound good and were easy to pair with my phone. Volume levels are good and I am no where near the max level and they are still plenty loud enough in the gym.UPDATE 03/27/2017: I accidentally ran these through the washer AND dryer. When I found them in my clothes coming out of the dryer I was devastated because I really like them. I expected the worst and you can imagine my surprise when they worked and took a charge. It was just yesterday but it speaks to the toughness of these earbuds.

A great product, and excellent service.


These were working perfectly when I got them. Then something happened, and they were reconnecting every minute or two. When I called Invotech, Bill very patiently walked me through the reset process and made sure that everything was working well afterwards. Since then I have not had any repairing issues. In retrospect I assume Apple must've had  an update to their software, and that was why I had problems. I'm using an Apple iPhone 7+. Anyway, thank you Bill for your patience, and your help.

The sound quality is pretty great for the price


Bought these headphones a while ago, waited to see how they hold up before submitting a review.The sound quality is pretty great for the price, maybe a little tinny for mids but otherwise no complaints (although I'm no audiophile so don't quote me on that). They have yet to fall out of my ears even once, the Bluetooth works with minimal setup (but if you have multiple devices you will have to manually connect from settings every time you switch as far as I'm aware), the accessories are thoughtfully picked to enhance the headphones - I would have liked to see a wall adapter but you probably have a thousand already so it's not a big deal.The main reason I waited before posting this review was to test the durability and see if any issues would arise from casual use. I'm happy to say that I've had the earbuds paired to an LG g3, iPhone 6s and iPad mini with no issues, the sound quality has remained consistent, and I can find no evidence of wear and tear from carrying them around in the case provided.In conclusion, these headphones are in my opinion a great option for someone on a tight budget who wants a cheaper option that will last a while. When playing music I can't hear someone calling my name from across the table, which is good enough noise isolation for me.

Let's say I won't be ordering another set of Beats as they are not $150 better than these


Left my Beats wireless buds at the gym..wasn't expecting them to be turned in. Ran across these and deoided to give them a try. Hey for under $25 figure what do I have lose. Let's say I won't be ordering another set of Beats as they are not $150 better than these. I would say that the sound quality is about 80% of Beats, especially notice on vocals. But, good enough for my gym workout for sure. They also came with 3 extra tips and a cushiony water proof tip, 2 USB to charging cords and a 2 in lighter USB port. The excesories are worth what the headphones cost. So this is day one. I'll need to see how durable they are.

Great sound and waterproof too


For a $36 pair of wireless headphones these are great in my opinion. I tried the $59 lg tone headphones and they were too tinny in sound quality. The senso buds have excellent bass along with the treble when it comes to listening to music on my iPhone. The biggest selling point for me ( besides the positive reviews ) was the fact they're waterproof too. This way if I'm the phone or listening to music while making deliveries and it starts to rain I won't have to worry about having to scramble on taking them off.

Repeat performance


I have purchased this before - over two years ago. My previous Active Buds worked great for me; worry free. I used them for yard work, late at night for audio/video so as not to disturb family members, riding my bike, Pickleball, and for golf. These are easy to operate and maintain. I like the part that goes over the ear - flexible and easy to adjust. Cost is very reasonable. I would recommend for anyone to purchase.

Affordability & Durable


I still have these earphones after 2 years of use. SENSO brand was on Prime and sponsored/ choice, I paid a bit more for these than identical looking options, but I cannot complain. Some people buy $100 dollar earphones that don't last a year and others $10 ones that don't last a week.  So far, so good. I recommend these for everyday use and I usually charge them after 4-5 hours of continuous use. Great Value and experience with my pair.

Doesn't work for swimming, ok otherwise


I got these to use for both swimming and water aerobics. Whenever my ears are in the water, the earphones stop working, so they don't really work for swimming. Fine for water aerobics. I'm not brave enough to have my phone on me in a waterproof case, so my phone is on a bench next to the lane I use in the pool. They might work just fine if you have your phone in the water with you. Also the battery life is not great. However, otherwise these function very well and the sound quality is good.

Good bang for your buck.


I purchased this headset along with a Panda Bluetooth 4.0 Nano USB adapter to use on my Ubuntu OS laptop, and also for general exercise/running. I had some initial difficulty to get the ear buds to seat properly in my ear, but after I got the hang of it the sound quality improved, and the headset proved very difficult to dislodge. At first the sound quality seemed somewhat 'tinny' but after adjusting a few settings on my laptop it improved dramatically (note: testing on my iphone the sound came through just fine). The quality of the included accessories is much better than I would have expected for the price.

They sound good, but they don't fit that well. They also broke and I lost the sound in one of the ears but was able to get it replaced for free without any issues. Unfortunately, my new pair also started having the same issue after only a few months.. It seemed like one of the connecting wires broke inside both times, as one ear was great, they other would turn on/off as I just wiggled the wires.

Good for listening to audio while exercising, but don’t make calls.


Ear hooks help the buds stay in place, which was the main thing I wanted. Sound quality is good. I sometimes have to power cycle a few times before music from my iPhone will actually play through the ear buds, which is a little annoying, but once they're properly synced, no problems. The mic is too far away to make phone calls, though; it’s hard for me to be heard unless I speak quite loudly. Battery life is good, although when you get the low battery warning, you’ve got at most 15 minutes of play time left.

Great wireless headphones for the price


These headphones look and fit comfortable and have pretty good sound. Granted, it's not better than some of the higher end models in sound quality; but for me they work just fine. I do have to sometimes lower the volume as there can be a little distortion with bass ; (depends on the song), but again I am happy with the results. I've only had them for a week, so we'll see how they hold up over time. I recommend them for a great starter set to try out.

Great but could be perfect with a couple tweaks


These headphones are solid performers that could be absolutely perfect with a couple minor tweaks. First off, the good:1. build quality is superb- they feel solid and the materials do not feel cheap.2. Battery life is as promised. I use these headphones daily for about 60-90 minutes at a time and I charge the headphones once a week.3. Sound quality is good.4. Comfortable fit5. Lightweight6. Storage case and free car chargerThe needed tweaks1. The lowest volume is relatively loud. If I could decrease the loudness a bit more at times these would be perfect2. Sound quality is good but is a bit heavy on the mid range and lows. An equalizer might be needed to get your desired sound profile

Sound quality is not great


These headphones got great reviews, but...even I can tell that the sound quality on these is not very good (and I’m not usually bothered by cheap headphones). They also look kind of weird, especially when the light is blinking on the front of your ear. I think if you’re going to go Bluetooth/wireless, you’ve got to spend a lot more money to get a decent pair. For me, it wasn’t worth it. Returned these and I’m sticking with the Apple wired headphones that came free with my iPod.

Great sounding earphone with extras


I used the earphones for about 6hrs straight listening a number of different types of music, some talk, and about 5 pod casts.  Sound quality is really good.  All the use was outside.  Although only mildly windy there was no perceptible noise picked up by the earphones.  With the buds firmly is place all outside sounds are eliminated.  My wife tried shoutin at me with my back turned.  Did not hear anything but the music.  The build quality and materials is first rate.  Finally, what is included in the box is more than I expected (i.e. multiple charging cable,ear pieces and a car charger).  I purchased with a substantial discount which made these a tremendous value, as well.

The best budget wireless headset... PERIOD!


This is the third headset by this manufacturer/ brand/ model that I have purchased and it keeps getting better!!! The sound quality is amazing, the receiving quality on the other end is great , and the latest headset allows me to form the earpiece around my ear in lieu of it having a set shape. So, it becomes customized to my ear. Battery will last the day.I listen to a lot of music at work and audiobooks/ YouTube videos in addition to phone calls. You must recharge the battery daily.Bottom line, the best $30 wireless headphones I have purchased (because I have either lost or my kids have eaten the others!)

Good quality headphone with an annoying light


My wife bought this headphone but hardly used it. I was looking for a headphone for myself and started using it since last couple of months. The sound quality is okay.  I won't say it plays best quality sound but reasonably good considering the price. The material quality is also solid. They also gave couple of extra buds. I had no issues with it until I used it on an overnight flight from kansas to anchorage. It has a blue light that keeps flickering ever since I play it and it was so annoying that I stopped using it on flight. It was a nuisance to the persons sitting next to me. The blue flickering light was really annoying and I guess it is not good for using in a dark environment or in a flight. Next time i will put a black tape on it if I don't buy a new one.

Junk - Wish I'd Known About FakeSpot....


I really liked these, brought two.  Yet after a couple of weeks the micro USB socket would no longer charge these headphones.  A close (10X) inspection showed a bent pin, not fixable given no space for access.  I ended up with 4 of this design in total; 3 stopped charging for to micro USB failure, on one the push button mechanism (soldered on the board) had broken. I can only blame the manufacturer so much; micro USB sockets fail all the time, yet those on phones will last 18-24  months so better compoments are available.

Good quality headphones but need some improvements


Have been using it for over a month now. Generally very happy with it. I like the materials and the case. Two areas would recommended improving. I have small ears so the hook does come off slightly when I run ... think either make the hook adjustable or provide another smaller hook. Secondly, there is no early indication of battery running low (I mean few hours early, not 10min prior which is the current case) and I can’t tell from the light that it will be running out of battery soon.  There are few times my earphone battery was out and completely shut down during my run which is  bit annoying. Had I known few hours before, I would have charged it prior to going for a run.Other than these two points, would recommend it. Price is very reasonable and is very light with good quality materials. I do like this pair of earphones!

Works for me but ear flaps are big!


These head phones appear to be good quality after a months use. Sound is great/sufficient, functions are great too... The reason I gave it a 4 Star vs. 5 is the windy-dingy wraps that are supposed to go around your ears... flaps are too big! I am 5’3, so not huge & have normal sized ears. Dang they almost had it & with the price it could’ve been perfect! All in all these are better than my last set. No issues connecting to blue tooth just READ the directions....which I didn’t at first! They work for me... I walk-run 2-3 miles at a time and lift some weights. That’s the extent of my use per workout.

That gentleman confirmed my purchase not sure where this going, he said I should have a new pair with 7 business days, I asked where I should return to other pair to he said to just keep them, totally didn't see that coming...even though they don't work properly I would think they'd want them back.Just received the replacement pair today, fingers crossed they don't cut in and out.

EXTREMELY underrated bud headphones.


One of the best headphones I've ever had. I never liked bud headphones. I always preferred On ear, over ear, or regular headphones. And to be honest I didn't know these were earbuds. If I had known I wouldn't have bought them, however I love my mistake. Give these a try before dismissing them because they are buds, you won't be disappointed. These really are noise cancelling headphones. I wear them while playing basketball and I can't even hear myself dribble the ball. The ear grip keeps them on my head even while sprinting. Not to even mention that you can pause, raise or lower volume, skip and go back songs, and even answer calls and talk! The IPx7 rating is awesome, as I've worn them while in the shower, with no problems. They last a long time, with at least a day and a half battery life. The only ""downside"" I've found is that they don't push bass that much, but unless you immediately try other headphones after these, you won't notice it. These are a bargain right now with the discount, and if you are considering them you should snatch them up often. I don't write reviews often,  and I only do so when I genuinely feel the product deserves it.

Not Water / Sweat Proof


For the money the product was adequate, but do not rely on the water proof rating. My first pair lasted a couple weeks and appears to have died from sweat while working out at the gym. The replacement was hassle free and I enjoyed the 2nd pair for about 6 months until I got caught in the rain one day while running. lasted maybe 15 minutes. Once finished with the run, I was unable to power off the earphones, pause the music, change the volume or skip forward or back. In other words, the buttons quit working. Service was great and sent me a replacement pair - which I'll keep as a backup if needed.

Loses bluetooth connection


I run a lot, and after about 35 minutes or so, they pretty reliably lose their bluetooth connection and it can't be restored for around 40 minutes. Tried a lot of troubleshooting and a replacement set, which had the same issue. I don't over-charge them or plug them into quick charge outlets, it just seems like a glitch in the product. Definitely not trying out a third pair! They tend to lose connection in the middle of a long run or workout which is very frustrating. Good customer service team, however; very fast and responsive and offered me a coupon to replace my defective sets. I wish the product was better, when they work the sound is good and they're comfortable to wear.

Great value, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!


These Bluetooth headphones are an excellent value for the money you'll spend, you won't regret it.  The earbuds (includes three different sizes) are extremely comfortable, and the silicone ear piece ensures that they stay in/on my ears when working out.  I've experienced other style ear pieces falling out, or being very uncomfortable.  Sound quality is great.  If you're looking for a good value, decent sound quality (I'm not an audiophile; these do have good bass response for what they are and the price), and headphones that will stay in while working out, then these are the headphones for you.CUSTOMER SERVICE:  OUTSTANDING, FRIENDLY, QUICK RESPONSE, MET ADVERTISED WARRANTY!These headphones are warrantied for one year.  I purchased mine in August, and they randomly stopped working four months later.  As Amazon directed, I contacted SENSO via email (they advertise 24/7 phone and email support) and received an apologetic response just a few hours later, and they also provided instructions to reset the headphones, which they said should solve the problem.  I followed their procedures, and unfortunately, they did not work.  I emailed SENSO Support back and informed them that their procedures did not fix the issue.  I had already provided them with my Amazon order number as they had requested.  Their response back asked me to verify my shipping address (which they got from the Amazon order info), and once I verified it, they would send out a brand new pair.  This process was so simple. AWESOME JOB ON GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS, THEY WILL NOT DISAPPOINT!

Very Comfortable, Good Sound


I've had my senso earbuds for about a week now and I really like them.  They are very comfortable and don't make my ear sore when listening to music all day.  The sound is great, doesn't totally cut out background noise but I can still hear my music without turning up the volume.  Still deciding if I like the flexible ear piece that goes around your ear.  It's nice because you can adjust it to fit your ear but you always have to adjust it each time you put them on which can be annoying but the material is soft and comfortable.  The only con I can think of is it needs a clip because if you only wear one earbud while doing something the other earbud drags down the other side also the clip will secure it to your clothing when they are not in use and are just hanging around your neck but you can buy clips for extra.  I've gone through a lot of earbuds and overall I am very, very happy with these earbuds hopefully they are durable and will last a long time.

Decent headphones - just not great for tiny ears!


The sound has been great and they seem to work over a nice distance.  However, I did not give it 5 stars because even with the smallest buds, they are too big for my ears and therefore slightly uncomfortable (I don't think I will be able to wear them for long periods of time).  I have small ears and the ear hooks are too large and barely touch the back of my ears, but they seem to stay put despite this.Overall, they are great for the price and I would recommend them to anyone with normal sized ears!Update: they don't stay in my ears when I run :(

I have owned these for over a month, and have taken them for runs and they work great. My biggest concern was whether they would slide off my ear and they do not. They are light weight, and good quality. The only thing I feel when running with them is the good sound. Easy to set up; easy to use; just great.Another great thing is the case: it is of hard material and compact, which helps with storage so they don't tangle and break.

These buds for you!


These buds are just downright awesome.  I've been using them quite awhile now and they're still working great.  I hate having to deal with cords while doing anything but especially during workouts.  These not only eliminate any cords dragging around, getting caught on stuff, etc, but the sound coming out of them is just phenomenal.  Most other buds I have to turn the sound to max and still it's not loud enough.  I've actually had to turn these guys down a time or two.

I'm very happy with the product. The sound is excellent and the different sizes of ear pieces is a very good addition. I've had trouble in the past with ear buds but these stay in my ear and are very comfortable when exercising or just listening. I'm not sure how the phone would work as there is no microphone that I can tell so your phone would have to be close enough to your mouth for that to work well. I also think it would have been nice if you gave some idea of the normal battery time so you would know when to recharge.Thanks for a great product..

I really wanted to like these headphones but they have a major design flaw. After charging them up in accordance with the instructions, I used them for my daily walks. While in the midst of a walk, I got the ""battery low"" warning for the first time. FIVE MINUTES later, the headphones turned themselves off and could not be turned on again. I spent the rest of my walk in silence.I couldn't believe that headphones advertised for working out would have such a short window between the first battery warning and completely shutting down, so when I got home I charged them up and tried again (keeping a spare set of wired headphones with me, just in case). When I got the first ""battery low"" warning, I started a timer. Sure enough, almost exactly five minutes later, the headphones shut off.The designers clearly were not thinking when they made these. That would be annoying in any Bluetooth headphones, but especially if you're marketing them to people who will not be near a power source while using them. On top of that, the booklet that came with them is full of warnings about the dangers of charging them too much, so it wouldn't be practical to plug them in after every use just to avoid the stupid things shutting off in the middle of a workout.

Pretty good product overall


Pretty good product overall. It syncs up with multiple devices such as cell phone and PC while doing an efficient job at toggling when the phone rings. Charges quickly and isn't too heavy in the ear. There is sufficient bass to use these as a computer earphone and watching netflix etc. I have had a couple people complain that it was difficult to hear me speaking during our conversations. They said it sounded like I was on a speaker. Overall, for running and for basic Bluetooth needs it works well.

Great For Price, Worth It


These are great for working at at the gym with running and lifting weights. I am a heavy sweater and these do just fine when covered in sweat. So far the battery last me a whole 2 weeks sometimes a little more. I just use them for the gym which is about 1 hour a day sometimes 2 hours. So it all depends on how often you use them. Sound quality is great I’ve used the beats before and there basically the same no crazy difference, only the price. These are great for price for sure.

It’s just ok


I have had this item for a week and use it over four hours each day. The sound quality is acceptable but not very great. Has a tendency to “buzz” when the volume is turned past 1/4. I have had zero noise cancellation with this item. If that is what you are getting them for, don’t. The battery life is quite good though.

Look elsewhere for your Bluetooth needs!


I JUST bought these and am not very happy with them at all...first, the fit is just terrible..I have small ears and am using the smallest ear pieces they offer and they still just fall out constantly..but the most irritating thing? They do NOT connect well to my iMac! I have to repeatedly go through the connection process every day to make them actually work..once the sound actually flips over to them, they're fine and they'll stay connected all day, but I shouldn't have to make the attempt at connection over and over again!Update: I have discovered a workaround for the connection process..I think there's a glitch in the process of powering on and the auto connect? So I have to let it go through that, and then manually, via my computer, disconnect it and connect.. Then it's fine.. Still overall not satisfied with that, or the ear fit..

I'm very happy I went with these


I'm very impressed with the sound quality and battery life. Previously I had a pair of Bose SoundSports and after forgetting them in a hotel room I decided to get a less expensive option. I'm very happy I went with these. They have 95+% of the audio quality of the Bose at 1/5 the price. They are actually quite a bit louder, which may be the only difference in the sound that I can tell. Very well worth the money. I listen to them all day long at work and have never had the battery die. Charges pretty quickly, too.

Good headphones for running or gym


I like these headphones from what they are. The only thing I really don't care for is the sound of the bass in them. I listen to a lot of dubstep at the gym and I don't expect good bass out of little headphones, but the bass sounds inflated and artificial. Other than that, for the price, they are great bluetooth headphones. They come with two charging cables, a carrying case, and a 12v car adapter for charging which was surprising for as inexpensive as they are. I've tried other Bluetooth headphones for cheaper that ended up being garbage, but I really like these ones.

Wow.


Literally so mad at myself for not getting these 5 years ago. Bass sounds basically the same compared to the Beats by Dre ones I tried from my friend. I've used the apple headphones that comes with iPhones basically all my life which are great, but the wire and having the have the phone in your pocket can get annoying after a while.With these, you can set your phone down in the middle of the gym and workout without having to worry about a phone being attached to you or a while dangling from your pocket. These also stay in your ear MUCH better than any other headphone I've ever tried and never budge even a bit. 10/10 and for the price, can't go wrong.

Great product with a Great price


These headphones are great.  I purchased these guys because when I workout, I sweat a lot, so the waterproof feature was a plus.  I also have small ears and thought that the ear hook would not stay, but these headphones are very snug even for my small ears.  The bluetooth connection was very easy.  Syncing was no problem.  And the fact that they come with three different sizes for the ear piece is also a great plus.  I would recommend these, especially for athletes or anyone who is in need of waterproof headphones.

... attempt at trying blue tooth headphones and I am happy to say it was successful


This was my second attempt at trying blue tooth headphones and I am happy to say it was successful! While the first ones I tried were hard to use and uncomfortable, these are very comfortable and easy to set up and use. I mainly use them for audio books,  but the sound quality for music seemed good also. The only issue I had was with the charger that comes with it. First of all, it seems way too short, but I was unable to get it to connect to the headphones. I ended up using the cable from my Kindle which works fine.

Excellent for the price


I'm a very active runner and have sent back a few pairs of Bluetooth headphones I've bought from Amazon in the past. Mainly for them not staying on very well.Prior to this purchase I was using Motorola S11 Bluetooth headphones and I was happy with those but they quit charging. I didn't feel like spending the extra money on a new pair.I've now been using the Senso Bluetooth headphones for a few weeks with no issues. For the price, the sound is excellent. The headphones fit securely on my ears and are pretty comfortable. The only time they became a little lose was towards the end of a 5.5 mile run. With all the sweat they were a little less snug but still good enough for me especially considering the price.I am giving this product 5 starts solely based on the price. Excellent bang for your buck. I would buy these again!

Great for price


I bought 2 pairs because I had one from a year ago that was stolen from my car. The part that goes over your ear is flexible and you can mold it so the headphones are pretty much guaranteed not to fall off. I work as a housekeeper so this is very important. The old ones ended up in a toilet maybe more than once. Im also very impressed with the battery life,mine usually lasts more like 9-10 hrs. One pair of my headphones didnt work right on arrival, but the replacement works great.

Great headphones, but do NOT work from distance advertised.


These earbuds are fantastic! They don't slip out of my ears in the least, the sound quality is great, and all of the accessories are such a huge bonus. My favorite part is how compact they are and how easy it is to slip the earbuds and their charging cable into the case that comes with them.I am partially deaf, and these earbuds go plenty loud enough for me. I can run, kayak, and even scrub down dorm bathrooms while carrying a ton of equipment with me, and I'm not worried about these slipping out.My only couple complaints are the following: first, sometimes they just get really iffy about connecting to my devices. They'll cut in and out. It doesn't happen often at all, but it does at times. Second: they definitely don't have a huge range. Although it advertises that they work from 30 ft away, sometimes mine work worse even from just a few feet away.

Sound is disappointing, but control buttons work well


So far, I don't like the rubbers around ears; they are stiff and don;t shape around ears. However, the ear buds seem to hold the headphones in ears snugly without need for tight rubber around ears. The other thing i don't like is the sound, it is not crisp, feels too much bass coming out. The sound is disappointing but not intolerable. All control buttons work well.It has been a few days of usage. I will update for durability and  workout functionality after some time.

Wanted to like them...


I really wanted to like these headphones.  I was impressed by the price point and the accessories that were included.  When they work the sound is good and the headset features are nice. That said, I constantly have connectivity issues and unless my phone is within a few feet and almost direct line of sight (literally having to keep my iPhone on the right side of my body) I have continual problems.  Even if I try to move my phone to an appropriate place I still have sound issues that equate to dissed jointed audio feed, making listening to music extremely frustrating.  I've tried to use these for running, walking, yardwork and/or riding my lawnmower. The problem persists in any arena of use and seems to be getting worse as time passes.

Disappointed


When I received the headphones I noticed that the ear pieces were angled slightly different from each other. I didn’t seem like it would make a big difference but I was never able to get one of them in my ear fully no matter which size I used over it. I also found that the Bluetooth range was only about 10 feet.

UPDATE: DON'T LOVE THEM ANYMORE


I use these for every single one of my workouts. They’re lightweight and they sound great. The customer service at Invotek is incredible, too!UPDATE:I loved these headphones. The first pair stopped working, but customer service was great and sent me a replacement. Then, the second pair stopped working. Customer service was not forgiving this time. So against my better judgement I bought a 3rd pair. This pair stopped working as well. I only used them about 3 times a week for an hour or two at a time. They were stored in the case otherwise so there was no possibility of physical damage. It's ridiculous that all 3 pairs died in about 1 year's time and the battery life is DEFINITELY not 8 hours. Don't bother with these headphones, they're a waste of money.

No complaints about these headphones


It's only been a couple of weeks, but so far these headphones work like a charm. The instructions for setting them up are easy to follow and while the initial sound quality wasn't all that great, I attribute this more to Spotify's equalizer being all out of whack. A few adjustments and the music sound pretty good, at least to me. It can sometimes take a minute to get them to line up when inserting them into your ear, but once you get it right, they aren't moving very easily at all. I can definitely recommend them.

Sound great, but they have trouble connecting to phone. REVIEW UPDATED


These earbuds have great sound quality, stay in place with the over-the-ear frame, and the battery lasts much longer than any other Bluetooth earbuds I’ve used before. I really like the foam padding that comes with them as an option to use rather than the standard rubber padding. If you’ve ever used foam hearing protection that you squeeze and roll to make smaller, place in your ear canal, and then it expands to fill the canal; this is the same concept but they have holes in the middle so you can hear the sound. Very comfortable and blocks out most external sound.My only complaint with these is that they often don’t want to connect quickly to the phone. Any time I turn them on I hear the voice say “Power on...connected” but if I start playing music it just plays on the phone’s speaker. It sometimes takes 30 seconds or more to actually start sending the audio to the earbuds, and sometimes never actually connects even though it says they’re connected in the settings. Also, even after connecting, the play/pause, volume up/down buttons sometimes don’t work and I have to go to the phone to make any adjustments.I’ve tried multiple other Bluetooth earbuds with the phone and these are the only ones that have this issue. If not for this issue they’d get five stars.UPDATE - After emailing the company about the problems I was having, they replied back with the following information:""Let's try a factory reset for your Senso headphones which usually fixes most similar issues related to the issue you are facing with your headphones.Here are the instructions for resetting the headphones:1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.""After doing the factory reset, they headphones are working great! They connect immediately and don't drop the connection. This made all the difference.

mediocre


I have bought these a few times in the past.  Here is the problem.  This set I bought had ear holders that bend very easily.  You might like that, but I liked the standard fit of the old ones.  My real problem is that I have gotten more cold to products made in china.  This is no way to know if these are real products or ripoffs.  If they are real, where were they made.  Not everything needs to be made in the USA, but definitely not China.  Amazon could not care less.

Have you ever been really excited for something and then the product you received was completely a waste of money? Well here it is, I bought and received these headphones quickly! I opened the box, read the directions and charged the headphones. Once the blue light indicated it was charged, I went to turn on the headphones and they wouldn't even turn on! Thinking maybe it was a lapse in my technical efficiency my boyfriend tried to set them up. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN POWER ON! followed by the power button getting stuck and the volume button COMPLETELY FELL OFF THE HEADPHONES!!!! Straight out of the box and never used.

WAY too bass-heavy, not comfortable, can't use while charging.


I'm really surprised how many positive reviews these headphones have gotten.  Maybe I got a lemon?  I find the audio quality to be WAY too bass-heavy and muddy, and the noise-cancelling feature completely lacking.  I primarily listen to headphones when I work (in a loud environment), and my old $40 LG headphones worked much better to drown out surrounding noise, not to mention sit comfortably in my ears without falling out with the slightest jostle. These Senso's seemed ok for music, but listening to any audio books, or podcasts (especially if the audio volume fluctuates), or any spoken word sounded like Charlie Brown's parents.  Another annoying feature is that you can't use the headphones while they charge.  This may not be important to most people, but I will occasionally have one headphone in at night so I can listen to music or podcasts without disturbing my partner.  It would be useful to be able to use them while charging, so that the next day I can start with a full battery.  Anyway, like I said maybe I got a lemon, but I will for sure be returning these.

True quality headphones


Ordered these things 3 months ago and as a college student I use these constantly.As workout headphones they are 9/10 always stay in your ears they are conferrable and sometimes you will forget you have them. music loudness is amazing along with the music quality. only reason it gets one point off is when you are running/ doing cardio the extra cord that connects the two pieces together gets annoying because they flop around but a small price to pay for amazing headphones.As a normal pair of headphones they get 10/10 zero problems with connectivity amazing music quality and they are convent when you keep them around your neck.They are advertised for having 8hrs of battery life and I have determined that is a lie.......they actually have nine and a half hours of continuous battery life before they die. and the fact they are also water proof is also good but I have yet to see if they actually are or not.Only major downside is when it warns you of low battery it is very loud and comes out of no where (has scared me a couple times) and when it first gives you the warning of low battery you only have 5 mins left and two more warnings before it dies. so when it gives you a warning of low battery. it is actually low and will die in the next five mins.Things to add, a button or button combination that will allow you to check the battery percentage would be extremely useful.gave it 4/5 because if I gave it 5/5 no one will believe its a real costumer writing a review.

I've been using these nearly every day for almost 2 years and they're still working great.


Sound quality:Not amazing bass for but clear and much better quality for music and conversation than other Bluetooth headphones I own.Comfort:I use them all the time instead of other pairs because of how long I can wear them in the gym, running, wherever without discomfort or them falling out.Durability:No wear or loss of sound quality in nearly 2 years. The only thing that wore out was the zipper on the case.Functionality:Occasionally minor problems connecting automatically with phone. Resetting it in iPhone settings is an easy fix.Would definitely recommend and will purchase again if they ever finally die.

Amazing, better than Beats


I was skeptical at first because of the cheap price, but these are really worth it and way better than Beats! They are very loud and much more noise cancelling compared to Beats. To my surprise and confusion, the charger cable is a 2 in 1 which includes a micro usb and apple lightening cable. The dual usb port car charger is also really nice! Took me a while to get used to the buttons on these headphones, but they are easy to use once you figure it out! My one complaint is that the headphones smell like cigarette/smoke :( Otherwise, they are great!

most refined or best sounding headphones I've ever laid my paws on


Buy these, for the price you cannot help but be thrilled.Are they the nicest, most refined or best sounding headphones I've ever laid my paws on? Of course not.At $30USD are they an complete bargain? Absolutely.I read reviews before buying pretty much anything, and went with these over a different brand due to the higher 4 star rating. I cannot say how thrilled I am, they pull double duty as a Bluetooth headset in the car and as the most convenient headphones I've ever owned for the gym. They sound great for the price, and I don't have any worries about sweating or showering with them. The car charger and dual lightning/microUSB cord are just a bonus with an already great product.If you want something that just works, and is way underpriced, buy these and don't look back.

Not satisfied at all


I recently bought new Senso handsfree again. I used to have the same handsfree and it worked perfectly for more than 2 years.I wanted to compare the new pair with old pair. Issue with new one is that the ear support is very poor it deforms very easily hence does not provide stability at all. While old pair was having firm ear support and it never bends. Please see the attached pics 1st pic is for new ones and later one is for old pair.Since I use this in gym only so I need handsfree which does not fall off and provide stability while on treadmill.Sound quality is good, battery life is also great no complaints in that area but it does not solve my purpose.I am not sure why Senso has degrade the quality of ear support. Very disappointing.

I highly recommend these headphones, five stars.


I am very pleased with the SENSO  Bluetooth headphones. I use them primarily at the gym while I'm working out and they do stay in your ears very well and the sound is excellent for the price.  I also bought a pair for my 29-year-old son who lives in New York City and uses them to work out and on the subway on the way to work. He is very pleased with them and likes him a lot as well. I am also impressed with the company as they contacted me more than once to see if everything was OK. The only difficulty I had  was plugging in the 3 foot cord into my headphones. I did not realize that there were two connections and how to pull out the part that plugged into the Bluetooth, which now works fine. I highly recommend this company, the product and their follow up support and I will give them five stars.

Won't pair after 1 year


Ordered these in April 2017 and had been very happy with them.  Sound quality was good, comfortable to wear and held a charge for a long time.  Liked them so much that when a lightning deal popped up for the newer version I grabbed it so I'd have a pair for workouts and one for travel.  This week after boarding a flight put on the pair that I bought in April 2017 and they wouldn't connect to my phone.  I assumed that I must have forgotten to power them down last time I used them, but rather than the red LED that indicates a low charge I saw that it was blinking alternately blue and red.  I tried removing the device and pairing them again but they wouldn't connect.  Like I said, they were great but I'm disappointed they only lasted a bit over one year.

Great price, great headphones, perfect for long session listeners


This is the second pair of these headphones I’ve purchased. I clumsily stepped on and broke the first pair but was more than happy to purchase a second. With the price they are now, they are an absolute steal. I’ve had at least ten different brands of Bluetooth headphones over the last 3 years and these are the best hands down. The battery life is excellent, sound quality is good, no skips and jumps in audio like I’ve experienced with others. The charge time is quite reasonable, maybe an hour or hour and a half from dead to full charge. My first pair I used 8 hours a day every day for work for six months and they held up great. I seriously cannot recommend these enough. One note: these are not headphones for audiophiles. If you are looking for incredible base and amazing sound quality, you’re gonna have to spend at least 100 bucks. That said, these still perform extremely well for their price point. I was not given a discount or free anything for this review, just my honest opinion that I give willingly for a great product. Thanks so much to SENSO for making these. I’ll continue to be a loyal customer as long as they are in business.

Decent value, but will need replacing


Solid headphones for the price, good battery life, but they quit working after a year of daily use. Great for listening during workouts, chores, or at the office, but on planes or while running the lawnmower they just don't get loud enough to overcome the engine noise. I was satisfied with my purchase, but if you can afford to go up in price you'll probably find something that lasts longer. If you've only got $25 to spend, you'll be happy with these.

I haven't used many Bluetooth earbuds due to the terrible reviews I always see


I haven't used many Bluetooth earbuds due to the terrible reviews I always see. These have surprised me and changed my mind about Bluetooth earbuds and their potential. The sound quality is better than I expected, but don't expect to be blown out of the water. They are a step above most run of the mill earbuds, but the volume level is quite impressive. Volume combined with their noise cancellation really do the trick. I had the pizza guy pounding on my door for a good minute before I saw the lights outside and answered. The range is pretty good. When synced to my PC I can walk to my front door, roughly 30-40 feet away, with no quality loss, though when I step outside everything cuts out almost instantly. Through 1 wall and door is fine though. These things are great, and if these should break after warranty runs out, I'll be buying another pair.

Great product!  Excellent support!


Both the product and the customer support are 5 star!  I purchased two of the Senso Blue Tooth earbuds over Christmas.  One for my girlfriend and one for myself.  The sound is impressive and the fit was better than any earbuds I've used in the past.  They actually stayed put during my runs and were comfortable too.  About a month after use, the small light that indicates the pairing mode, charging status, etc stopped working on mine.  The earbuds still functioned fine...just no light.  The support team was quick to reply with suggestions to do a factory reset.  When that didn't help, they shipped me a brand new replacement pair.  I would definitely buy from them again.Also, you can't beat the price on these.  Before selecting this pair, I tried a few others at the same time.  I normally assume that a more expensive item is better quality.  In this case, I tried a pair that looked, felt, and sounded identical by TreLab.  Not to say anything negative about them or their product, but the Senso version again appears to be identical but cost less and includes more accessories.

Bluetooth works great with my iPhone 6


Was not originally thrilled with the sound quality but received an email from the company that their customers were their #1 priority. I explained that there seemed to be distortion at medium volume level they sent me an email to factory reset the ear buds. I have to say it improved the quality immensely.Bluetooth works great with my iPhone 6. Excellent quality when talking on the phone. If you like a fair amount of base in your music, you will be very happy with these. As a point of reference I own a par of the Powerbeats2 and GearCircle Bluetooth ear buds as well and these are very much in the same neighborhood on quality sound.One area where the SENSO excel is with ear comfort. The parT that goes around the ear is a soft silicone or rubber that sits gently on your ear and doesn't irritate after hours of wear. I have also never owned a pair of earbuds that fit so securely and softly within the at itself.I don think you can get better sound for the cost.

Headphones can't keep a solid connection from three feet away


I bought these headphones because of the great reviews.  I was excited to get them and they seemed to be everything I wanted in a pair of Bluetooth headphones.  The sound is pretty great, they stay in my ears well during exercise, and they are comfortable.The biggest issue they have is the connection is unreal spotty.  I put my phone inside my basketball shorts during my workout at the gym and the music breaks up constantly.  I had to pull my phone out of my pocket and hold it close to my chest in order for the connection to be solid.  It's possible that I received a bad pair of headphones, but I am truly surprised that they can't keep a solid connection from 3 feet away.  I do wear a Garmin watch during my workouts and if these headphones can't handle a workout watch while being connected, then I am very disappointed.  (Everything was charged, I don't have issues with my iphone 7 and any other Bluetooth device)

False advertising. The box did not contain the multi port cigarette lighter charger or the 3’ lightening charger cord. Very disappointing. It did come with a vehicle air vent mounting device (which I won’t use) and a credit card sleeve for your phone (which I won’t use). Headphones work as advertised.*******Update- I wrote the company and they took immediate action and mailed me the missing items along with an apology. Great customer service.

I ran a 10k recently with my new SENSO headphones. As others stated the sound is pretty great! My biggest thing with ear phones that they need to stay put in the ears during activity and that's why I purchased these...well during my 6.2mi run I had to readjust both earphones which was annoying while running and they did attempt to fall out on several occasions during my run. I'm Not sur if these are the greatest earphones for long distance running, But for a few miles it may do well and working out I'm sure it would do justice. I also felt they were slipping out while I was sweating. Not sweat friendly. But for the price I guess you can't really beat it

These are pretty awesome. I wanted something wireless so the cord from my iphone headphones wouldn't keep swinging back & forth when I was on cardio machines at the gym. Once I figured out how to actually turn it off, I've found out that the battery life is great. I've gone about 4 90-minute gym sessions without having to charge them. There's a battery life indicator that shows near the phone battery (on an iphone, idk about other phones) so you know when to charge it. They do hurt my ear a little, but most earbuds hurt my ear so that's more my thing than the fault of the headphones. They're also a little bulky, but they do fit very well and I've never had a problem with them moving. Overall, I would recommend them. Great value.

Luxury disposable earbuds


Top quality sound, noise canceling earbuds.Only issue is that they are not rechargeable more than once or twice.If you're in the market for really good fidelity earbuds that you plan on throwing away in about six weeks, these are right in your wheel house.  On the other hand, if you'd like something that lasts, maybe two months, steer clear of this product.

Great Sound at affordable price


I have now purchased several of the Senso Headphones.  They sound is great but you need to make sure they are properly seated in your ear to hear the full dynamic range the headphones can produce.  Sound is clear and has plenty of volume.I use them all the time, especially at the gym.  I bought a pair for my wife and she really likes them as well.For the price, it is hard to imagine there is a better pair out there.  Just need to make sure the battery is charged which doesn't take too long.  Usually about 30 minutes to fully charge when the battery is completely drained.  With a full charge, they can last anywhere from 6 to 10 hours.Overall, I am quite happy with the Senso headphones and highly recommend them.

Great for exercising or house work!


I loved these but now they WON'T play media on my s7edge.  The media says it's playing but no sound in the headphones.  They still take calls and I can hear on calls fine, but that's it.  If anyone knows of a fix, let me know because of course they are no longer returnable.  Updating review.  It was the S7edge's fault not the headphones.  I hard-booted my phone to clear the cache and now they are working just fine again.  There is a bit of ringing feedback sound that's barely noticeable, but still an irritation, therefore the 4 stars.  Overall I would recommend these.

Good for the price


Bought these headphones in December 2018. They are good quality for the price. They didn't fit me great, but ears are weird, so not too big a deal. They just crapped out on me last month; one of the ear buds stopped working, so I only get audio through the right side. I give them a 3 because they were good while they lasted, but I had hoped they would last longer. Then again, for the cost, maybe 2.5 years is as good as one should expect.

Good value, even though ear loops way too big


In the 5 days since these headphones arrived, I’ve tested them in a series of situations, & my conclusion: they’re a very good product for a reasonable price. My one beef is the ear loops, which don’t adjust down for those of us with smaller ears. As soon as I unboxed them & tried them on, I resolved to send them back because the ear loops were a deal-breaker. Upon further consideration, I decided to trust the many positive reviews (even from small-eared buyers) & try them out before returning them.As other reviewers have noted, they arrived fully charged & ready to use, & they paired easily with my iPhone 6. I’ve worn them on a long but easy walk, on the subway, on a very long & extremely sweaty uphill hike, & around my apartment. In all situations, including the all-important challenging hike in the hot sun, they stayed in my ears & sounded great. I made a phone call indoors, & they worked fine. I’m not sure how phone calls would work in an outdoor, windy situation, though, because the passive noise canceling lets in lots of sound, such as wind & subway din. That’s okay with me, because I like to hear if somebody’s coming up behind me when I’m walking.Now, about those ear loops, which are a significant design flaw & lost the headphones two stars. They are useless for those of us with small ears, & they get in the way of hats & sunglasses. When I wear these things (see photo), I look like a kid wearing dad's headphones. Luckily, the small earbuds keep the earphones in, but having properly fitting loops as a backup would be ideal. Senso, please wire the loops or find some other way to make them fit different ear sizes. Even if doing so raises the price a couple of dollars, it’d be well worth it.

Best purchase on amazon for quality vs investment


Honestly, I'm not normally one to put much effort into rating an amazon item unless it is truly spectacular. I have been happy with these headphones since I purchased them 2 years ago. I haven't written my review until now because about 3 weeks ago I accidentally left them in a pair of shorts that got washed in my washing machine. Thinking I was definitely going to have buy a new pair, I still gave it a long shot chance to dry before purchasing a new pair. Sure enough after 2 days of drying I charged them and they started right up with zero defect. Truly the best purchase I have made on amazon for the little money I had to invest.

I am very pleased with my purchase


The earphones use a combination of over-the-ear loops and insert-able ear buds.  Though they are not officially noise-canceling, they do keep out a lot of extraneous ambient sound when I use them.  Another feature that I like is that as soon as I power them on, they connect with my phone and are ready to use - no repairing or reconnecting required as with other bluetooth products.

They will work in a pinch.


They aren’t the best, by by far not the worst. There are a lot of little things that make these not a great set of headphones. One being the connecting. On mine, if there is already something like music or a movie playing on my phone and then I truth these on, they won’t connect. I have to shut the media app completely off, connect and then they will play. The range is pretty darn good though. I can easily walk 60-80 feet away before they start crackling. This means I don’t have to have my phone near me at the gym.

FRACTION of this cost of Beats...(but don’t) get them!!


Do NOT pay for Beats! These work quite well. Battery lasts a very long time. Nice bass response! Good fit. My only complaint would be the mic not picking my voice up adequately in a phone call. And there is some wind noise when walking/running caused by the housing design.OUTSTANDING customer service. They will make sure your are happy with your product!Revised: After a year, these headphones constantly cut out. They sound good when/if they are connected.

They are awesome please read


I love them. These headphones are most definitely base heavy. I think they still are most definitely a stell for the price. I didn't believe that they were waterproof for the price they were, but they are. I like that thay come with a 2 in one iphone charger and a charger to charge the earbuds. The case could be a little bigger, but the  case is the about the same size as most earbud cases. I think they stay in pretty good. The extra earbud pieces that they come with are a little hard to put on but, it has to be hard to put on to keep it to be waterproof. When you are going to get them wet make sure the charging port is closed so no water gets in it ruins them. I also really like that the warranty is good for like 2 months. The ear think that wrap around your ear is a little flimsy but, they do not fall out of your ears.

Not bad, but feels a bit bulky


Not bad, but feels a bit bulky. I was actually expecting the wire that connects to two earbuds together to be round but instead it was flat because I brought another brand that had the flat wiring but eventually lost sound to one bud due to the flat wire being easily bent at the connection point of the earbuds when I work out. But other that it's not bad because they came with many extras like a magnetic phone holder for your car and a credit card holder sleeve for your phone too. Fingers crossed that this headphones with the same type of flat connecting wires will hold up for my daily gym use.

I bought these based upon the fair price (about $40) and the positive reviews. I can say, after using these fairly regularly for about 2-weeks, that they are a great purchase. I didn't expect the over-the-ear piece to be a pliable as it is, but it works well, is supportive, and very comfortable. Also, the microphone works well, but isn't great when outside in a moderate wind... which is probably the case for virtually every headset-based mic.If you are one the fence about these because they are so affordable, don't hesitate -- I love them.

Range and Water resistance not as good I hoped


For the price these are decent headphones. Audio quality and build quality are about as good as you could expect at this price point, but there were a few letdowns for me. In hindsight I regret getting a cheaper pair and will buy a better set now that these have broken. I had two problems:1. They do not seem to be fully up to the IPx7 rating that the description suggests. I had these in my bag while kayaking. The bag got slashed for the few hours we were out there. It was pretty wet, but did not have any standing water in it. My iphone 7 which has the same IPx7 rating and was in the same pocket had no issues, but these stopped working.2. The bluetooth range quoted on these is only by clear line of sight.  I used them with my smartwatch (vivoactive 3 Music) to listen to music when I run. When running outside I would have to switch the watch to my right wrist (closer to the transponder) in order for it to work. Nothing major, but when a range of 30ft is quoted I did not think it would have any issue going 3ft from my left wrist to right ear.

Used everyday at work,battery lasted almost 16 hours. Has fare sound. The main problem is it will start disconnecting from the phone even when it is just in my pocket.

I've had these for a few weeks and used them quite a bit.  They are light, comfortable and easy to use.  I've gotten them wet (I'm sweaty) and dirty and they function fine.  The microphone feature is great for making phone calls.  Great product, particularly for the price.Well, after several months of use, I need to come back and adjust my review.  The won't charge anymore.  At first, if I toggled them around a bit and played with the buttons I could get them to recharge, but now they won't charge at all, so they are useless to me.  Perhaps it's not realistic to expect reliable headphones for 30 bucks. I am going to invest more money and hopefully get something that will last.

Amazing value for the money


Packaging shows the love for detail. Love the charge cable that works for Iphone and headset. The set came charged and was very easy to pair with my Iphone 7. I was amazed at the sound quality. I love my Bose headsets but this does an amazing job! It fits my ears perfectly and did my first workout with them today. I used to listen to my Iphone through the Apple earbuds, but this was so nice to be able to place my phone on the floor and not in my pocket. Fits perfect and cable hangs conveniently in my neck. More than enough volume!I recommend this to anyone that does not want to compromise sound quality, spent an arm and a leg, and work hands free.

Broken in 5 months


After using the headphones for 5 months, they broke. They repeatedly turn themselves off even when fully charged, only the right side works, and only sometimes connects to my phone. Even begore this, my headphones would need to be completely reset in the middle of listening. They would just shut off with no warning, even when fully or mostly charged.

Sound quality great. Fit needs a little adjusting.


The sound is great, the weight is lite and easy to wear.  The over the ear fit is not as snug as would have expected so far but will give it some time to see if they fit better over time.  Very easy to change songs and volume which is a plus.  I have not taken a phone call yet but the button is easy to reach and sensitive to touch.  Let's hope the over the ear becomes a closer fit as it might be difficult to keep on when jogging, which I have not year done as I have only had them a few days.  One day at a time.

Incredible Quality and Value


First, the quality of sound is amazing for the price. Ease of Setup, that's an understatement. The set was fully charged out of the box, I turned on Bluetooth on my phone and connected effortlessly. Great quality of sound, great volume. Mic works great too. They are built with durability too.And to show how much they believe in their product, you open the cool little case that holds the ear buds and peripherals, you'll find some really good quality charging cables, a car charger that doesn't look like something they got free bit rather very nice quality, and backups plugs sitting on top of a pamphlet that says call this number 24/7 if anything goes wrong. Wow. I got an email shortly after saying the same thing, 1 year warranty. I was blown away. It took my son all of 2 Days to see how happy I was with them before he needed his own set. Cool color options, I got him his own color, because these are mine! 😀

Overall design


They wouldn't stay on my ears. The overall design is not great. There is a part that bends behind your ear that is adjustable but I would have to keep adjusting it every song or so because they just wouldn't stay put. They turned out to be a big hassle which defeated the purpose of having wireless ear buds. I do not recommend this product personally.

Plastic Goes Straight


The plastic that goes behind the ear bends way too easily and won't stay curled up for even 1 minute. Very cheap material, not even worth $1. I don't know how this would stay in your ear while working out if it doesn't even stay on while sitting. Really heavy too. If the plastic would stay on, it would be too heavy to wear for even 5 minutes. Worst design and material I have ever seen on earbuds.

Phone sound is amazing


I've had these for almost 2 weeks now.  I have to say they are better than I thought they would be for the price.Pros...The piece over the ear is bendable.  Took a bit but now they are extremely comfortable.I mainly use them to talk to family on the phone and audio books and the sound is very clear.  You can adjust volume by your phone or on the ear piece.Now, I thought the mic would be a problem, just the opposite, I come thru crystal clear on the phone.  WoW.ConsThe battery doesn't seem to last long, for me anyway,  but 4 to 6 hours of constant use might be good for others.But then again it takes about a hour to recharge and I'm back to using them again.I'll definitely be buying these again as gifts for my family.

Hi everyone.. just received my senso blutooth headset. I was so excited to get my first blutooth earphones.. Amazon packaging was good which dont have any damaged items.So far i tested every functionality  of this product and everything works fine. For the cost of 37 bucks i never imagined that we get this amazing headset. No pairing issues, easily paired with my phone. It already came with full charge.Blutooth range is around 20 to 30ft, after that you can here some descripency in the audio, which can be ignored.Pros:Cost wise this headset is an excellent choice. Better than other popular brands in the current market. I am sure that you dont get disappointed.Cons:Previous track was not working properly, which can be negligible.This is my first review. I wil post my full review after using at my workout.

I purchased this item a few months ago. I've purchased LG Bluetooth headphones at least for times. Everytime one earphone would die. I purchased these because of the review on Amazon. While it may not be a Bose, the earphones don't sound bad. It has alot of base but I like it. I bought it so I could workout with music. It still works six months later. Also the battery life is decent. If you don't want to spend a lot for earphones these are definitely worth the money.

These are surprisingly good bluetooth headphones.  They pair easily and fit my ears very well.  Sound is good but not audiophile but that is not what I got them for. I find it hard to believe that they can sell these for less than $40.  Highly recommend these for anyone wanting bluetooth ear buds for exercising or casual listening.  They stay connected up to thirty feet from your device. And they include 2 charging cables (one has a convertible end for iPhones or miniusb), a dual car charger and really nice case.

Great headphones and Excellent customer service


These are my first pair of wireless headphones. I wish I would have gotten them sooner. So much better than regular headphones that need to attach to your phone or iPod. I work out every day so I need good reliable headphones. I bought these in March of this year and the headphones starting turning off on their own last week when the battery wasn’t even dead. I contacted the company and they gave me detailed instructions on how to fix the issue which I followed. A few days later the headphones turned off again while I was listening to them. Since this product comes w a one year warranty, I have another pair on their way. The company was extremely quick to respond and address the problem. This is literally the best  and quickest response I’ve ever had from a company when their product malfunctioned. The fact that they come w a one year warranty and they are inexpensive to begin with shows how much the company stands by their product. Excellent customer service!

Great customer service. Really waterproof and the sound quality is good. A bargain price for such good quality.


I have been extremely satisfied with these headphones which I purchased in September of 2017 and they serve me well. I'm a runner so I need a lightweight pair that stays in my ears with good sound. Also it is waterproof as I happily found out when I ran in a rainstorm while training for a marathon. They are my go to headphones for my long runs. The only thing that don't like so much is that it's hard to rewind songs but that could just be the fact that I haven't read the instruction manual. Overall this is a good product for the money that I paid. So when they suddenly stopped working about a week ago I was concerned but then I remembered that they were covered under a one year warranty. They have wonderful customer service as they responded quickly to my email and I had a free replacement with a few days! I definitely recommend this product because it works well in the rain and the company stands behind their product.

Terrible sound quality


Terrible sound quality, volume super low. Like many others here, I had a pair from last year and loved the sound. Both the quality of it, and that these can get loud enough to drown out city noises while running.I lost that pair and ordered a new one and they just aren't the same. Reached out to Senso customer service which was great and had a few suggestions but those didn't work. I thought I might have just gotten a dud pair and was going to do an exchange, but there are so many other reviews by people like me that previously owned these so I'm just returning and starting the search over.

The PERFECT Headphones


I've had these headphones for a few days now and the only thing I have to say about them is that I LOVE them. I can't tell you how many wireless headphones I've purchased in an attempt to find a pair that is reasonably priced and has impeccable sound. And these are the perfect ones. I'll also throw it out there that I bike every day and these fit right into my morning routine. I've also been using them at work. I haven't had to charge them since Friday (3 days ago).They're easy to pair, stylish, comfortable to wear, and most importantly, sound AMAZING. They sound as great or better than other highly priced competitor products.If you're in the market for the perfect pair of headphones, PLEASE try these out. I promise you won't be disappointed!!!

Your money's worth!!


I loved these ear-buds. I bought a pair about a year ago and they still delivered good sound comfort and battery life (I could go my entire 2 hr work out without a hiccup). Recently, I lost them and came back to buy another pair, but I see there is a newer model. I'm really skeptical about getting into the newest model, since the old worked so good for me. Any one had try the old and new to compare?

FORGET BEATS....TRY THESE OUT!!


Originally I was hesitant because as a consumer we here a brand and expect quality. I was working towards my 3rd pair of Beats...and extremely upset about that given the brand. I came on here and decided to give Senso a chance and I am glad I did. My son cracked jokes on me being an Apple guy....but he himself gave me the stamp of approval once he heard for himself the sound quality and comparing them to his Beats. In any case...I havent had any issues at all. And based on the reviews even if I get 8 months out of them I still would feel I got my moneys worth and I didnt dish out another $129 for name brands. Highly recommended.

Audio cuts out while working out


Audio kept cutting out while jogging with phone strapped to my upper arm.  Company emailed me after purchase, and suggested I reply if I had any problems.  I did, and heard nothing back.  I called them, and they walked me through a pointless procedure that did not help at all.  Service rep on line did not care about the problem, did not want me to try to reproduce after pointless procedure, told me to ""call back"".  I am returning them, and avoiding this brand in the future.  It failed at the one use case it NEEDED to nail.

LOVE these so much that after ordering my first pair, I ordered another a week later! All that's different is the first pair are in a black and red case and the second ones in a black and blue. EASY to link with your phone, a pleasure to wear, user friendly, and a really nice case that holds the earphones and the charger I use to charge them in my laptop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE.

Buy the less expensive option!


I liked these headphones until after less than 6 months the ear part popped out and was literally hanging by a wire. I realized it when I took the headphones out of the holding place I kept them in right before I left for the gym. I contacted Senso and they told me the warranty wouldn’t cover this even though it happened through no fault of my own. They did generously offer me a 5% discount on new headphones. No thanks. Found others on Amazon for less $ and work just as well.

Don't last - but good quality - while it last


Buy these+ ONLY if you need them for 3-6 months.  I've had 2 pair to stop working after a few months.  Both pair were well cared for.  Both times I followed the recommendation for factory reset and it doesn't work.  The quality for the price is excellent, with the exception that they don't last. The manufacturer sent me a replacement for the first pair.  I'm not so sure I want to go through this every few months.  Time to look for another brand.

201708 used for less than 2 weeks. For similar price range this one is still rather bulky with great sound if earbuds stay in the ears.Wire hanging on the neck, plugs are coming slightly out from the ear which makes a huge difference in sound.Also, if you exercise the excess wire will rub against the neck pulling out slughtly either of the earbud (at least for me).Plus for controls and plus for water resistant (if true), battery time and quick to connect.

Not the headphone’s fault but thought you should know


I was excited to receive these headphones and looked forward to using them.  I put my iPhone in my pocket and listen to audiobooks on YouTube.The sound would keep cutting in and out. The tech guy at target and a genius at Apple told me that the metal in my artificial hip was interfering with the signal and there isn’t really an solution.  So, I’m sure the headphones are fine but I’m really disappointed that I can’t use them.

Very satisfied


I was a little nervous about buying my Senso headphones. I had never heard of the company, but the reviews were very positive. It took about a week before I pulled the trigger on the purchase, and I'm glad I did. They sound like much more expensive units then they are. Great sound quality, good highs and lows. Very balanced sound. Perfect for someone on a budget who still wants to enjoy their music. To make it even better, they charge fast, last long, and are very comfortable to wear for hours on end. I will definitely recommend them to anyone looking for good Bluetooth headphones.

These don't really fit me


I purchased these off of the Amazon recommendation, and I should have read more reviews.  My ears are small and these are just too big.  Even after putting in the smallest ear bud, they don't fit well in my ear, the ear loops are way too big and therefore useless, and they are heavy and keep falling out of place.  As a female, with apparently small ears, I just cannot recommend these.

Great quality for the price!!!


These headphones are wonderful! Especially for the price. I bought two sets one for my boyfriend and one for myself. I mostly use them to listen to music but occasionally to chat on the phone. The only downside to these is that people on the other end of my phone conversation have a hard time understanding me. I have attempted to reset via the manufacturers directions but nothing changes. Aside from that the sound quality for music is wonder and they are great to have in the gym instead of my plug in ones that get wrapped up in the gym equipment. My boyfriends gave out almost a year after purchase, but he used his every single day so I am impressed.

Terrific Bluetooth headphones!


I am loving these headphones!  I purchased them to use with a new iPod Nano, and so far they are working wonderfully.  I was able to easily pair the headphones to my Nano, and they fit well on my ears.  The sound quality is terrific, and it is easy to increase or lower the volume.  I have not tried using these headphones to answer a phone call on my iPhone, as I use another bluetooth device for that.  But they are just what I needed for my iPod Nano so I can exercise outdoors and listen to music around the house.

Excellent Bluetooth Headphones


I don't use headphones very often and didn't want to spend $100+ but I knew I wanted Bluetooth.  I am VERY pleased.  I read a lot of reviews on Amazon before deciding.  While there were similar headphones available in this price range, what made me decide on these was the little case that came with them.  It's small and fits the headphones and extra ear cushions perfectly.  I used them listen to music and watch movies/television on my iPad.  They were perfect!

For the price, these phones have been very reliable. I bought a pair to work out with for myself.  A month later, I bought 2 more.  One for my wife and the other for my son.  The sound quality is pretty good.  Battery life lasts me a good amount of time.  The chord is the perfect amount of rigid and not rigid. It doesn't get tangled like chords that are two thin. I haven't had a problem with them yet.  Plus, the price for these is very reasonable.

Nice ear buds. But? Bought these for my wife. Tried them out my self, they have a lot of bass. Sound pretty good though I thought for ear buds. Then I rode my bike with them on. A lot or wind noise,and yes they are stuffed in my ears really tight. Sound pretty good as long as your not moving to fast. I personally don’t like a lot of bass and these produce way more bass than treble.  Not for me. I guess she may like them I hope.

Short term use only. Does not last.


Excellent sound quality for what you pay and solid battery life. I bought my first pair and loved them so much I bought a second after they got stolen after 2 weeks at the gym. The second pair came with broken ear piece and was easily refunded. Got my 3rd pair 2 months ago and now they can’t stay connected to my phone for an entire song. I have no issue with my wireless headset or my blue tooth speakers or my vehicle connecting to my phone so I know it’s the ear buds. They definitely aren’t made to last and at the price I can’t say I’m shocked. If you hardly use ear buds these are a great option, if like me you use them daily for an hour or more look for something better that will last.

Comfortable, but Broken.


These worked great for a month, but started degrading quickly. First, I started noticing that any amount of movement significantly stuttered the sound. So running was out of the question. Next, the range started shrinking. I have to keep my phone as close to the right earbud (where the receiver apparently is) as possible to keep it functioning. I'm hoping this one is just a dud, and am currently going through the return/exchange process. Hopefully #2 works a bit better!

I bought these for my Boyfriend who was severely needing a new pair, as he constantly uses his headphones while he's working throughout his long shifts, and he's gone through 3 during the last few months alone.Pros:-Almost impossible to kill after extended use, the product suggests 8hrs of constant use, but it seems to be more of 12hrs!-Charges very fast, but that might be because these headphones are impossible to kill.-Voice quality on mic is excellent when taking phone calls.-Excellent sound quality-Offers different sized ear buds, which is a plus!-Carrying case is nice, and perfect for traveling-Made of wonderful material, feels good to wear for hours on end-Very reasonable price!Cons:-The only con he's even spoken of is that the range of the bluetooth is less than his old ones, but the quality more than makes up for the smaller range!Thank you!-Happy Customer!

I really like these headphones


So far these headphones are amazing.  They have great sound and were very easy to pair with my iPhone.  The controls work great and it has 2 charge cords, one which works as an iPhone cord and charging cord for the head phones. I have only been using them for less than a week but have not needed to charge them yet.  They come with a car charger but unfortunately it does not have a wall charger.  That is the only draw back, but again you can just use the phone charger.  Really pleased with this product.

Work good in the gym, but outside doing things like mowing the lawn or riding the motorcycle they like to constantly break up or disconnect.

Just get these!!!


I tried 2 other brands of Bluetooth ear buds before purchasing the Sensos. The first brand I purchased was defective right out of the box. The second pair developed a short after just 3 uses. I was beginning to become very skeptical about purchasing any Bluetooth earbuds that were reasonably priced. I went ahead and ordered the Senso brand and I ever glad I did!  They come with s nice case, various sizes of ear cushions and some nice cables. They also included an email from the seller assuring me of their quality and letting me know if I need service or support they will be there for me. Quality is very good. The ear hooks are soft and comfortable. Sound quality is also very good.  I am certainly no audiophile but I can clearly hear all ranges. Bass is adequate but not booming. Miss and highs are very crisp and clear. I highly recommend these. I don't believe you will find a nicer set of Bluetooth earbuds for the money anywhere!!!

Superior sound and comfort, weak connection to phone


I've been using bluetooth headphones from Mpow for a few years and bought these when I needed a new pair. These are far superior to my old pair in sound quality and comfort, but I was very surprised with how easily they lose connection with my phone. Apparently it's a common problem with bluetooth that it doesn't transmit through the body well, but I never even knew it was an issue until I used these and looked up why they weren't working. I keep my phone in my left pocket most of the time and that's enough to make these headphones unusable. I wore them for a run and I tried holding my phone in my belt, and the music paused and skipped every couple seconds regardless of which side of my body my phone was on.If an inconsistent connection is something you're used to or can work around then these headphones are fantastic for the price and easily deserve a 4 or 5 star rating, but I'll be getting another pair of my old ones so I don't have to think about where on my body I hold my phone.

Great deal for the money.  Way underpriced!


Great product especially for the price.  A quick 15 minute charge on the way to the gym keeps the earbuds charged for my entire 2 1/2 hour workout.  The sound quality is almost as good as that of Beats or Bose earbuds but at the price, I can't complain.  The case is quality and so are the accessories for charging.  Longevity is my only concern but time will tell as far as that goes. After one week of having these though, I rate them 5 starts and probably the best bargain I've come across in a long time!

Great Headphones! Just received them. Easy to charge, usually 2 hours tops. Very simple to use for music or phone. Syncing with iPhone a breeze. Multi-size ear buds makes finding the correct fit easy. Sound quality is a must and these sound real good. I had to tweak the equalizer in my phone to get the right sound, no special app needed. I've used them in the gym weightlifting, cross-trainer/elliptical machine. They don't move much so don't have to keep adjusting for fit. Jogging shouldn't be a problem either.

I set my phone down while playing pandora and walked about 40 feet away and they still were connected


After eye-balling these headphones for a couple months, I finally gave in and just bought them a week ago and they work great so far. I have a Samsung Galaxy phone and the bluetooth connects just fine. I'm not sure about the accuracy of the negative comments but I found these headphones were built pretty well and the sound quality is sufficient to my liking. I set my phone down while playing pandora and walked about 40 feet away and they still were connected. I also like how they came neatly packaged with a carrying case, extra rubber ear buds, and a magnetic car mount for your phone. I'll probably never use it but it's the thought that counts. If anything changes down the road, I will be sure to update my review but so far so good.

Awful customer service


I would give this a slightly higher review but I can't because the customer service isn't great. The first time I charged the headphones they said to be fully charged, then they wouldn't turn on. So I plugged it back into the charger and the headphones had the red low battery light turn on again and were charging for a couple hours.They wouldn't turn on for a couple of days, and this was after having them for about a week. SENSO claims to have a warranty on them but when I emailed the company, they never contacted me again. The headphones eventually started working again but it was frustrating that they stopped working for a little when they were brand new, and also that the company never got back to me.Also I know there are people saying these fit small ears, but they honestly don't. I'm 21 years old, but I have very small ears. I always have to use the smallest tip sizes and I would not be able to work out in these headphones. They are way too big for my ears and regularly fall out. The foam earbuds were too large too and hurt my ears. I guess they're good when they're working but the size is definitely an issue.

Maybe it's me and if your like me none of the buds truly fit


Maybe it's me and if your like me none of the buds truly fit. They tend to slip out and you'll need to keep your head still to keep em in. Forget about cardio exercises. These will fall out in 2 min flat. Either the sweat causes the slipage or the rubber and buds dont seal well.Maybe try using foam tips on these for good seal and better sound.However the sound is great. Nice and loud.And the battery can last you days which is sweet because I forget to charge them a lot. Beware the annoying female voice when the battery is low. She'll tick you off before shutting off.It's waterproof and I can vouch for it since I've carried them through days of sweat and rain storms.Good deal but beware they might not fit or stay on that well.

These have been great so far


These have been great so far.  I've primarily used them for when I'm in the gym to avoid hanging cords.  They do well with (maybe tmi, but a LOT of) sweat, and don't get in the way at all.  Very comfortable to boot.  Not sure how much continuous usage you'll get (haven't tried it myself yet), but I've yet to have them die on me mid-use, or only plug them in every couple days when I bother to remember.One caveat is there does seem to be some possibility for interference on the bluetooth connection.  There's one corner in my neighborhood where the connection always seems to get spotty, and I can only presume some local phenomenon is causing it, because by the next block it's fine again.  Might be a nearby cell tower or some such.

Better Than Other Similar Types of Bluetooth Earphones... BUT...


I bought 3 different brands(yet similar looking) Bluetooth headphones. This one lasted the longest. The other 2 died after 6 months to a year, this I have for 1 year and 3 months. BUT, I bought 2 of this, one for me, one for my gf- my gf's died after 3 months. So I guess it is a hit or miss. If it works, it works great. If not, well...

These headphones are by far the best set of Bluetooth headphones that I own. I have several well known brand Bluetooth (LG, Jarbra, BBD) and these headphones are far more superior. The sound is great, including a more than decent bass tone. They connected easily right out of the box, additionally, the comfort level is excellent. I usually wear them for at least an hour at a time and I didn't experience any discomfort. I am not being paid for this review and trust me, I am a very picky shopper.

I would not buy these again as there are better options in the same price range


The on/off bottom got jammed and I cannot get it out. This started happening a few weeks ago but I was always able to get it back out. However, it's finally gotten stuck and now they cannot be used.Prior to this, they worked fairly well but I've had other brands that had longer lasting batteries and a larger range for the Bluetooth.Overall, I would not buy these again as there are better options in the same price range.

BEST PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY A++++++


"" I BOUGHT TWO SETS OF THIS REMARKABLE EARPHONES, ONE FOR MY WIFE AND ONE FORMYSELF. AFTER USING THEM A FEW DAYS WE ARE BOTH VERY IMPRESSED OF THIS LITTLEWONDER. FANTASTIC SOUND QUALITY,LONG BATTERY LIFE AND EASY PAIRING. I HIGHLYRECOMMEND IT FOR EVERYONE A++++ I BOUGHT A MONTH EARLIER A SONY MDR-X650 BT FORA $100 BUT THIS SENSO'S RECEIVING DISTANCE IS CLOSE TO A DOUBLE IN COMPARISON!NOW THE BAD NEWS: A DAY AFTER I WROTE MY REVIEW, ONE UNIT'S RED MAIN PUSH BUTTON SWITCHFROZE IN THE PUSHED IN POSITION, SO IT BECAME USELESS. AMAZON OFFERED A FULL RETURN OFTHE PRICE IF I RETURN IT, BUT I WOULD RATHER PREFER A REPLACEMENT WITH ANOTHER UNIT AS I STILL THINK THAT  THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR THE MONEY.

Definitely satisfied with them


Bought these headphones after doing fair amount of reviews. Definitely satisfied with them.Pros:- Beautiful sound. Clear, with good bass.- Simple to setup and operate.- Fits very well. Use it in the gym or while running. Never slips or creates any obstruction.- Decent range. Can roam about 20-30 meters away from the iphone/laptop while still having clear sound.- The microphones pick up sounds on any call nicely. Have never heard any complaints from the other end.Cons:- Single charge life: Works for 3-4 hours at time. While this is not a major drawback, I am of the forgetful kind. The charge runs out at the most in-opportune moments ... :)All in all, will purchase it again.

one earbud stopped working and amazon will only offer a refund minus a 20% late return fee.


don't buy, i thought buying a bluetooth with wired earbuds would circumvent the issue of one earbud going dead, but lo and behold still happens.  after a couple months the right earbud, the one with the charge port no less stopped working. on top of that amazon will only offer a 80% refund because it broke after 30 days.noise cancellation is weak too, does a poor job blocking ambient noise. sound quality was ok but tinny while it worked.

Great sound


They're better than expected. The sound quality and bass are very nice. They're really loud, I can only listen to them half of the volume. Great buy, specially given the price!!!Updated: 11/2017I’m still happy with my purchase but unfortunately the cable on the left side became loose and the sound will not come out unless I keep moving the cable. I’m very happy since they lasted all this time! I use them EVERY day since I bought them, specially for running and they are great!

Solid mass market headphones


This is an instance where $10-15 more gives you a product of a completely different class. These feel pretty high quality, the packaging and accessories are top notch. I've worn them in the rain and showered with them in and they work fine. Battery life is probably 6-8 hours at a reasonable volume.Only con is the audio quality is just a lil bit lacking, but at least they stay in no matter what, which is more than i can say for any other cheap set that I've tried out.

Great Sound, Great Price!


Great wireless headphones, amazing price! They were very easy to setup and connected to my smart phone and smart watch without issues.It's worth mentioning that since the power and volume controls are on the right earpiece and I was wearing my smart watch on my left wrist, I initially had some connectivity issues while on a run. Switching the watch to my right wrist solved the issue immediately, as our bodies can cause minor electromagnetic interference. So if you're having issues with the sound cutting out constantly, ensuring your device is on the right side will likely fix that!

The sound quality is good and they were easy to set up


The sound quality is good and they were easy to set up.  I also like the sound volume on the headset.  I bought these, because when I take my dog on a walk, she sometimes gets excited and jumps on me and knocks the earbuds out of my ear.  With these, I don't have to worry about that.My only complaint is they cut out when I turn my head to the right. When I turn back to the front, they work again.  Wish I knew how to fix this.

Decent sound but completely useless due to wind noise!


I bought these headphones on a lightning deal during prime day.  After looking at all the reviews giving it 5 stars, i figured i couldn't go wrong.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong.  Let me start by saying these headphones have pretty decent sound if you are indoors.  they may have been just slightly bass heavy, but that was OK for me as i kind of like my music that way.  The problem with these headphones is the horrible wind noise you get from them when you are outdoors.  It makes the headphones virtually useless as the music is totally drowned out by the wind.  After trying to reposition the earbuds, etc, I came to the conclusion that it is an inherent defect in the headphones themselves.  I have another pair of bluetooth headphones and even on the most windy days they keep that sound out pretty well.  In the end, it was so bad that i did end up returning these headphones for a refund.

Can't turn them off or on without multiple tries!


These headphones are CRAP!!! 😡 They only have one button for all functions. When you try to turn them off they pause, then you have to try to turn them off again. When you do this you get a message in your ear saying ""dialing last phone number called,"" and And you have to scramble to get your phone and cancel the phone call. Then you have to try to turn the headphones off again...and it STILL will not work. It takes on average three tries to turn the headphones off when you’re done with them and on average at least two tries or more to turn them on when you want to use them. Sometimes when the headphones say they’re connected to your phone they’re actually not and music will still play out of your phone.

I HATE FLEXIBLE EARHOOKS!


WHYYY did they change to flexible earhooks? I had the last SENSO model that had the stable earhook - some of you may remember, the ones that came w/ the car charger and the dual USB to charge either iPhones or android devices (aka THE BEST ONES). The earhooks were so much more stable and better for the fit I was looking for. After over a year of use almost daily, my old ones finally gave out so I purchased the newer model, which has flexible earhooks that I HATED bc they wouldn't stay on my ears and I kept having to readjust them while wearing. I returned and bought what I thought was the previous set (the S-250, vs S-255). NOPE they ""upgraded"" the earhooks on the previous model too, with the flexible earhooks :(  IDK WHAT TO DO NOW AND I'M SUPER SAD bc they were the best wireless headphones for the price.

I was skeptical because these are half the price of my last few sets of wired headphones.  Item arrived on time and was very easy to set up.  I was surprised, these sound incredibly good (Bluetooth or not).  Even the bass is strong and tight.  Easy to use, fit great and stay in place.  I should have made the switch to these a year ago.Thanks for a great product at a fair price.Now I feel like a chump for spending all that money on ""high-end"" earbuds in the past.

Very comfortable and easy to use.


These headphones are comfortable and very easily synched with my bluetooth-enabled Kindle Fires.  There is a new kind of fun and freedom in being able to listen to my Audible books, or music, or podcasts, without having to carry the Fire or force others to also listen to what I am hearing while doing so.  I have both hands available to do other things and I do not have to worry about the earbuds falling out of my ears and getting lost.

I am pleasantly surprised how great these headphones are working for me. I have weirdly shaped ears an most earbuds won't stay in place, especially when I am working out. I was even able to have a conversation on the phone while on the treadmill during the busiest time of the day at the gym and the other party on the phone was able to hear and understand me, which is a definite plus!

Every time I use them (3 days a week) the blue connectivity becomes worse and the battery does not last more than 30 minutes (yesterday was only 5 minutes) when they are fully charged.

I've only used these headphones for one day, but so far they have worked great! It's nice to not deal with a cord and the sound quality is wonderful! My only complaint is that if the device you're using (I was using an Ipod) is connected to WiFi and you're having problems with the WiFi (I was being kicked off and on again) you will hear a quiet clicking noise from the headphones each time you are disconnected and reconnected. It wasn't super noticeable, but I could still hear it. Other than that, great product!

Great in many ways. One caveat.


I like the headphones.  My only suggest is that the multi function button - power on and off as well as receiving a call - is extremely easy to press when you don't mean to do so.  This is because putting on the head phone is easiest by pushing exactly where that button is.  Even knowing that, I have inadvertently ended a phone call and had to call back several time.Other than that, I am delighted and truly appreciate the one year warranty as well as your followup to assure I am happy with the product.

Buy These Headphones NOW!!!!


These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones that I have ever owned. Not only are these headphones sleek and good looking, but they are so easy to use! All of the functions that these headphones offer are more than normal headphones. While at the gym, I was able to stream Spotify from my phone (which was in my gym bag, in my locker) seamlessly. My headphones never once shifted or tried to fall out. While I was working out, I was able to skip songs, turn up the volume, answer calls, and have the surrounding noises of fellow gym-rats working out around me dampened enough to where I didn't even hear them anymore! These headphones are the best pair of headphones I have ever owned.When I received them in the mail, they were charged and ready to go! I linked to my phone in seconds and started streaming music immediately. If you are looking for wireless headphones for working out at the gym or running in your neighborhood, I strongly recommend these headphones!

Garbage


Bought my first pair last year and I was impressed initially. The sound was great and the battery life was awesome. Then, after approximately two months, they just stopped working... wouldn't charge or turn on. Being that they were $23, I purchased another pair on July 17th. They lasted 6 weeks and did the exact same thing. These won't charge or turn on. I know the old saying, you get what you pay for, but this is ridiculous.

These wireless earbuds are pretty good for the price. I got them for mowing and walking and they do a great job for those purposes. The noise cancellation isn't anything special, but it does cut down outside noise some so you hear the music better. I am an audiophile so these wouldn't be my go to set for serious listening, but they sound really good as a whole. Remember, you aren't paying a Bose price, so don't expect a Bose sound.

These Buds stayed on my head and were way more comfortable than the over the ear headphones I previously used


I bought the Senso Active Buds to use with my new Iphone 7 during workouts. I used the Senso Buds during my intense workout at the gym yesterday. These Buds stayed on my head and were way more comfortable than the over the ear headphones I previously used. I was pleased with several advantages over my over the ear headphones; I could keep my phone in my gym bag while working out and reception was great, even as i traveled  as far as thirty to thirty five feet from my phone. I could change volume, answer calls, and change songs without ever having to touch my phone. I am extremely pleased.

Pros: Easy to use. Connects to other blue tooth devices easily.Cons: Sound is OK, but the earpieces don't fit me well enough to function as noise cancelling.

Worrisome earhooks


So I had a pair of a previous model that lasted two years and I loved them. When they finally broke after one too many falls I bought a new pair.  They are still great but I am not fond of the adjustable earhooks. I can never seem to get them just right and they are always messed up after storage which makes me worry they will break from all the movement. I store them in the carrying case but it doesn't take much for them to snag on any little thing and pull them out of alignment.  But aside from that design issue, I love the way they fit in my ear. The sound quality is great for listening to podcasts and the battery lasts a long time.

I REALLY like these.  I am starting to run and need earbuds to stay in place for 45 minutes or so.  I've tried the iPhone earbuds and SkullCandy wireless earbuds.  They both get loose and I'm constantly having to readjust.  But not these.  The earpiece holds them steady and gives them plenty of support to stay in place.  It came with a cute little kit and 3 size options (S, M, L) to custom fit your ear.  And the wire band is very light and doesn't swing around like the SkullCandy ones do.  Recommend.

The sound of these headphones is very good. I didn't have any issues. At times it is shocking how much sound I miss when not watching with earbuds, or use them for music. My only complaint is, and this is NO reflection on the seller, is I cannot find earbuds to fit my ears and stay secure.

It's annoying how every product can run around claiming HD


It's  annoying how every product can run around claiming HD.  These are not HD headphones.A very flat sound. Not for you if you have a musical ear.More of a low mid sound. No highs or sub.If you listen to music with actual instruments and sound clairity matters then Pass on these.I made sure before I made this statement that I had in fact downloaded high definition audio.  Luckily Spotify has an equalizer.  It helped a little bit but still.  I don't feel it can be called HD.  But if you've lived life not knowing what true sound is you probably wouldn't notice.  As for me..  I've got better sound from a $10 pack of skull candy which to me are the best for the price.  Sure this is blue tooth. And you get what you pay for .  But don't run around claiming HD.

Excellent headphones at an excellent price


I've only had these headphones for a couple of days, but I loved them the instant I tried them. They fit well on my ears (try a different earbud size if you have trouble, they send different sizes with the product), the audio quality is AMAZING (I've used them to listen to music and to make phone calls), and they're so out of the way I almost forget I'm wearing them. And it comes with so many great accessories (I especially love the case for the headphones that fits easily in my small purse). It's such a great product for such a great price (I paid $36). It's rare that you actually get something of excellent quality without having to pay an arm and a leg for it (other headphones I looked at were between $50 and $200). I'm glad I didn't waste the extra dollars because these headphones are wonderful. I plan to get my husband a pair.

By Far The Best Inexpensive Headphones


The fact that these headphones are under $25 is ridiculous! The noise cancellation on these guys are insane. The sound quality is great. Although the sound quality could be a little better, for sub $25, the sound quality is an absolute steal. I have owned a pair of Beats Headphones in the past and these are honestly comparable in terms of noise cancellation, if not better, but the Senso headphones are a little inferior to Beats in terms of sound quality. Taking into consideration the price point and the quality of Senso headphones, I would buy these over any other headphones in a heart beat.WARRANTY: The right earbud just recently stopped working after about 5 months, but the customer service team responded quickly and was able to offer me a replacement pair in about 20 minutes time after exchanging e-mails. Great service and a great product. Highly recommend.

The best yet!


So far, these are the best Bluetooth headphones I've purchased. They fit right, battery life seems good, and they get louder than any other headphones I've had in the last few years. This was really important to me because the background noise in my gym can get in the way of hearing my music, etc. Also like the fact that they are connected and go around the ear. I had trouble with previous buds falling out on long runs. For the $ these are a steal! Not to mention the extras that it came with. The car charger and micro USB / lightening cable are a huge plus.

LOVE these little gems! So many excellent features! Takes up very little space in its small round case! Comes with 2 usb charging cables and a dual usb car charger. Super comfortable silicone ear pieces that hold the buds securely on/in your ears. Comfortable neck cable connecting the buds (important for frequent airline travelers). Surprisingly good sound quality for the price with the correct earbud tip fit.In short, these are ALWAYS  in my bag. Never leave home without them!

Easy to Set Up and Use


This is my first Bluetooth product so I was unsure how difficult it would be to set up. and I was pleased that the Senso headphones / ear buds were very easy to charge and pair with my phone, and I'm listening to a podcast right now.  I have not tried them with a phone call yet but I expect that that function will also work well.Another test that I haven't done yet is seeing how well they work while running but my experience so far leads me to believe that they will be fine with that also.

Not these. Next!


After all the other glowing reviews, I guess had higher than average expectations for these.They're not good.They pair fine, battery is long-lasting enough.But the sound...they are about on par with the earbuds you get handed at trade shows or on airlines. If you like music to sound good, don't buy these.And the fit...earpieces strangely shaped and too heavy to be supported by your ear alone. Not to mention the over-ear hook is completely useless as it is too large to properly fit any normal ear. VERY uncomfortable unless you have HUGE ears.

I'm upset to say I'm not satisfied with this product


Update -----I gave this another try purely because I was desperate for a Bluetooth headphone in a bind. After another week trying them out, I can say they're pure crap. They've ruined so many runs because they DONT STAY IN so I have to keep slowly down to either readjust or put back in my ear. The strap that goes around your ear honestly makes it even harder for them to stay in your ear because they're so big so that just flop and help the ear bud fall out.I've try to contact the seller multiple times with no response.Original review------I'm upset to say I'm not satisfied with this product. After excitedly awaiting it's arrival, the headphones just aren't what I expected. The sound is good and the connection is excellent, but once I start any sort of physical activity, the headphones slip right out. I tried all of the ear bud sizes and nothing fits right. I think this may have to do with how loose the hook for behind the ear is. Overall I'm upset to give a bad review, I thought I had finally found a perfect pair of headphones to run in.

Unimpressed


The sound quality is certainly not the best, ok for podcasts, but not for music. But even more annoying is the fact that sound cuts out constantly. For example, I'll have them connected to my iPad while reading. Every 20 seconds or so, the sound stops accompanied by little beeping sounds. And I quickly discovered that they cut out  completely when I leave the room where the connected device is. Truly disappointing. I've gone back to my trusty earbuds.

I recommend for the price and quality of sounds


When I was looking for Bluetooth headphones I seen these with many reviews. I read reviews and the reviews were great reviews had to check for my self. I received them and used them right away. I used the headphones for work and the noise cancellation works great. I really couldn’t hear much just the music. The sound is great as well. The reviewer had said that they have the same quality as the beats headphones. I think the SENSO can be compared to beats headphones and way better price. I also check how far can can get the Bluetooth headphones stretch. It was about 100’ until the headphones cut out. These headphones I recommend for the price and quality of sounds.

Buy these now!


If you're looking for a great pair of Bluetooth headphones I highly recommend these! I've used my brother's Beats Powerbeats which inspired me to want to buy a similar pair, however I wasn't too fond of shelling out over $130 for headphones especially since my wired Beats ear buds didn't last very long. Searching for a cheaper alternative I came across these and after some consideration I bought them and am sure glad I did! As far as I'm concerned these are better than the Powerbeats in about every conceivable way. They are more comfortable to wear, they feel lighter, the connection with my phone is better, they come with more accessories, they are less expensive and the sound is great! They are so loud, it's ridiculous. I am so glad I purchased these, they could easily be $100+ for the quality. Do yourself a favor and buy a pair or two.

Terrible headphones!  Do not purchase!  Headphones don't work and support is non-responsive.


These headphones do not work as advertised.  I use them to exercise in, so they do get sweat on them but they have never been submersed in water.  After about 4 weeks of use the headphones stop working.  Senso support will send you a replacement pair, which will break after 4 weeks of use.  Then, when you report that the headphones broke again, support will not respond.  So, I bought a second pair on Amazon and the exact same thing happened - worked for 4 weeks, stopped working, got a replacement pair that stopped working, and then Senso support doesn't respond.  These headphones are prove the saying that ""you get what you pay for"" - cheap, crappy headphones and poor support service from Senso.

Excellent quality and functionality but one drawback.


This product is fantastic in so many ways.  It's clear, it has intuitive control buttons, and it has a nice case as well.  My only complaint is that it does a poor job of picking up a signal from my phone while it's in my pocket.  It would work fine if you have an armband holder for your phone I think.  I love it for listening when my hands are free to hold my phone though.

Not for small ears!


Beware! I love these headphones but they barely fit my ears. If the top of my ear was a few millimeters shorter then the over-ear part would just slide right off.Also: It's really annoying how it beeps when setting the volume to either the lowest or highest value on my phone. Especially since the beep is super loud when it ""warns"" me the I've reached the highest sound level. It just about blows up my ear drums.

Great Value Until the Left Headphone Went Out ~6 Months


**Update: Invotek customer support was 5 stars so I've modified the rating. They immediately honored the 1 year warranty. They did a quick troubleshoot and then sent out a brand new pair of headphones for free. The headphones, like the original, work great.**Two stars because for the first 6 months, the value of these headphones when considering their output for the price was 5 stars. However, the Left phone has unexpectedly stopped working. It occasionally goes in and out but that almost makes it worse.I'm hoping to get a clear understanding of the warranty and exchange process. Hopeful that I can exchange these because they had great performance when working.

The headphones stayed in my ear while running, jumping, doing handstand pushups, CrossFit, but the hooks did not even rest on my ear. The whole head set relied on making sure the earbuds were in my ear canal, which was uncomfortable for the size and weight of the headphones.The sound quality and Bluetooth are pour. The music kept cutting in and out, even while I was standing still and my phone was in my hands, about two and a half feet away from the Bluetooth on the headset.Returned this after three workouts with it. It is not worth the money, compared to the cheap wireless headphones that my roommate has. Same price, not as bulky and uncomfortable, and the music does not cut out.

these seem like nice headphones except they stink for I needed them for. These are easy to use synk to Blue Tooth, sound good, comfortable, look nice and come with nice accessories. BUT - I purchased these to wear while I'm out bike riding and all I can hear is the wind slamming up against the flat leading edge. It's seriously loud and makes listening to them just awful. I'll be returning to my old cheap wired earbuds while biking and maybe use these for listening while indoors with no chance of wind.

I’ve only had these for a week but they are awesome. I love how comfortable they feel (I have walked around in them and cleaned house in them and have they had felt very secure).  The sound quality is great. I have alsoUsed them several times for conference calls and had zero issues.  I have never tried a very expensive pair of ear buds but my coworker just spent a ton of money on some beats wireless ear buds and I think these look just as great if not better due to the price point. I like the case that comes along as well as the charging cords and car charger. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing these before dropping a ton of cash on the expensive brands.

Very nice wireless ear buds


I like these ear buds, they have good sound, stay in place while working out, are comfortable to wear, and are priced very fairly. I own quite a few headphones and ear buds, although I don't own the beats wireless ear buds, so I can't compare them. A number of reviews have compared them so I'll just I am happy with these. They are better looking and fit better than other wireless buds I have. Nice for working out, going for walks and office wear. Especially for the price you can't go wrong.

Fantastic headset, super comfortable AND noise cancelling. #1 customer service too!


Awesome headset! I have used them at work 9 hours a day, every day for 11 1/2 months.After nearly a year, I had an intermittent failure in the wire lead going from the power side (right) to the left bud. 1 call to Tekatron and a replacement was at my door in 2 days.In comparing the 2 headsets side by side, I see they have reinforced the exit point of the leads with a longer flexible outer sheath. This should fix this problem from recurring again.

Ok, but not great.


I bought these 7 months ago. I liked them mostly at first. Sound quality is ok, but now I’m having some trouble connecting the Bluetooth. When I turn on the device a voice will say “connected” but sometimes it doesn’t actually play my music for awhile. Also almost every time I turn them on now they will lose connection at regular intervals. It’s weird, it’ll beep every 10-15 seconds turning off my music then turning it back on. Very annoying. After I turn it off and back on a few times it seems to fix. But very inconvenient and I’m looking for a good replacement. I guess you can try at your own risk...

these are great headphones.  I have a pair of BOSE Quiet Comfort headphones that I use every day in my work.  So, know good sound.  Even though these SENSO headphones aren't the same as my BOSE, they are excellent headsets.  They sound great and very easy to pair up with my Samsung S8+.  I've tried using them to make phone calls and really like how it sounds.  And then I used them for music and am impressed.  For the price, these headsets are really nice.

The sound is good and they are very comfortable


Although I usually run without music I am training for another marathon and on the long runs I am carrying my iPhone 7. It was looking for a Bluetooth headset to use and bought these based on the reviews. The sound is good and they are very comfortable. They work well when running although sometimes the connecting cord, which rests on my neck, doesn't freely slide due to sweat on the skin so if I turn my head it pulls the earpeice out slightly but with the hook over the ear it doesn't fall out. I was about to buy the similar Beats but for my purposes I am glad I save the money.

Sweat ruins them


This is the second pair and both went bad within 6 months. The first pair the USB port fried somehow when plugged in overnight. The second pair started not holding a charge for more than 3 hours after 4 months of purchase. Within 6 months just turned off in middle of workout and then wouldn't charge anymore. I surmise that the rubber over the USB port isnt sufficient to protect from sweat. So don't buy these.

For the price point you can't get much better. Buy with confidence great product


Just purchased my Second pair. I work in a major UPS hub as a maintenance mechanic and wear these every day. Climbing ladders and climbing around the conveyors, they stay put and work well. Sometimes I wear them with the audio off and just use them as simple ear plugs.For the price point you can't get much better.Buy with confidence great product!!!!!*Update *It seems as they've made changes to these ear buds. The ear loop now has a wire in them instead of just the silicon. I find myself constantly adjusting the earbuds now. Never had any issues before. Also it seems as if they changed the Battery, I used to get 10-12hrs with my first pair. These newer one's barely make it 9hrs, this is kind of a bummer because if I work a OT shift I have to remove them and recharge where as I didn't have that issue before.Still a good product but I wish they left them alone.

The sound quality is perfect for me


My husband has a pair of Jaybird wireless headphones that he paid much more for and they constantly fell out of my ears during my workout. I have used the SENSO headphones for a variety of workouts, including HIIT training, yoga, kickboxing, and running and I did not have to adjust these once. That is HUGE!  The sound quality is perfect for me. I have had a few instances where I received a distorted sound, but it was from the bluetooth signal being blocked. I moved my phone each time and it corrected the problem. If you need a pair of wireless headphones for working out and you don't want to be bothered with readjusting you need to buy these.

I love my new Senso Bluetooth headphones. I use to hate running on the treadmill with my old headphones they use to slip out of my ears every time I started sweating, not anymore. I love the fact that every time I connect or disconnect my Bluetooth it lets me know via voice prompt. It comes nicely packed in a box with a storage box, extra earbuds, o short usb charging cord and a long usb charging cord for car. This is good stuff is high quality from the packaging box to the headphones. If you like running on the treadmill and hate your old headphones I recommend that you buy these your going to love them, no more workout interruptions.

Great product and a good price. I recently decided to get wireless headphones and returned the first pair I got from a different company in this price range.

Great customer service!


My wife bought me these as a gift.  I use them during my workouts. They worked great easy to connect and use, comfortable and good sound.  I was happy with them until they stopped working suddenly ~ 7 months after use.  Earphones would not power up no lights when plugged in.  I thought great now the hassle of trying to get them repaired.  I registered them online with Senso e-mailed customer support with the issue and received a response within 24 hours with troubleshooting items to try first.  I responded the same afternoon that nothing worked and prepared myself for the long drawn out back and forth with customer service to try and get item replaced or fixed.  To my surprise I received a response the very next morning  apologizing for my inconvenience and asking to confirm the address they had on file so they could process the warranty claim.  I confirmed my address and expected to see replacements in 4-6 weeks or something like that.  I received a message my replacements shipped and I received a brand new pair on Saturday.  From my first e-mail to having a replacement working pair in hand was less than 1 week.  Now that is great customer service!!!!  I would buy again from this company as they clearly value their customer service and stand behind their product.

I've had these since June 2017. I use them at the gym. They pair easily w/my Android phone. The sound is good, and loud when I want them to be. The foam earbuds part of these get grotty pretty fast. This is my only complaint. Sweat is not kind. I've tried soaking the foam buds in warm water with dish soap to clean them. It would be good if you could get replacement foam thingies for them.

These are great. I like them better than my last pair, and I really liked those. The sound on these is real nice. With my last pair, the wire would sort of grab the back of my neck when I would turn my head, tugging at the headphones and sometimes causing them to fall out. So far, with these, I don’t get much if any of that. I find they sit in my ears nice. I would definitely recommend these. Obviously, find the bud covers that fit your ears and your in good shape.

You get whatcha pay for


Sound quality is decent. It has a hard time being connected to multiple devices at once. I'm typically near my computer and my phone when using them. It will connect to both but regardless of which device I use to output audio from, it will crackle unless I disconnect one of the devices. When using them to talk on the phone, the other person on the end sounds pretty muddy. Battery life is eh. Overall, I probably would spend a little bit more $ in the future to get something over higher quality.

This is my first pair of running headphones but I'm very very pleased with the quality of the product. They stay on well and I don't have to fidget with them while working out which is often my issue. I think the sound quality is also great and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a car charging port, two chargers, and a carrying case which I wasn't expecting (obviously didn't read the whole description). I say buy it if you want a solid quality headphone that stays on well for a very reasonable price.

Customer Service is Exceptional!


I buy a lot of things through Amazon, and consequently am bombarded by requests to review products. I always ignore the requests, including the request that I received from SENSO after ordering a pair of their ActivBuds. My initial experience with the ActivBuds was good as they connected with all of my Bluetooth-capable devices and delivered great sound. Then suddenly they stopped working and refused to pair with any of my devices. I wasn't very happy about that. I emailed SENSO from their website, hoping that they would stand behind their product. I was SO impressed with the Customer Service and prompt action taken by Kim. I received a response to my email the very same day, along with a request for my order ID and assurances that SENSO would be sending me a replacement unit at no cost. I received my replacement unit today, less than two weeks after reporting the problem. My replacement ActivBuds have again connected to all of my Bluetooth-capable devices and the sound is great. I have high hopes that these buds will last, but either way I will remain impressed with SENSO for their exceptional Customer Service.

so far so good.  My dog ate my last earbuds so I got these.  I work from home and these are working out real well during my calls.  I haven't had any issues.  They paired easily to all my bluetooth devices.  The only issue I have had is that I have small ears and they are quite large.  I have to def wrap the ear piece tighter around my ear to stay in place.  Thankfully, it's flexible and moves easily.

These were comfortable and felt as if they could be worn for extended periods. Unfortunately, I did not get to put them to the test because they didn't work. They constantly cut out and continually disconnected from my phone (galaxy s7) unless I held my phone within inches of the headphones. I ended up returning them. It was disappointing because I wanted something to run with, and these felt as if they could have been really good. Four stars for comfort, one star for usability.

Absolutely the best pair of Bluetooth ear buds I've ever bought


Absolutely the best pair of Bluetooth ear buds I've ever bought. And I've bought  many others including the Dr. Dre Beats ones. After being in my ear all day, the Beats hurt my ears (uncomfortable fit). These Senso ear buds are very comfortable even after wearing them for 8hrs plus. I listen to them when I work and they really out-perform any others I've had. I listened to music for about 5hrs and had them on stand by for another 5hrs and the battery did not go dead. And they charge very quick. The sound is very nice also. Great base! Bluetooth signal is also very nice. I can go pretty much all around the house and not lose the signal. I've had other Bluetooth ear buds that have lost the signal just by putting my phone in my back pocket. For the $38 I paid, very nice investment. Would highly recommend these ear buds.Update:well after almost 6mo one of the ear buds developed a short. Called customer service and they sent me another pair within 2 days. Very satisfied

They work for me!


I was looking for Bluetooth headphones and came upon these via Amazon. Four thousand reviews catch your eye. The hard part about purchasing any headphone is the impossible task of knowing whether or not they will fit. I've learned that I'm a straight up earbud kinda guy as opposed to the more (forgive me but I don't know the right word to use here) triangular style that came with my Samsung Edge phone. They just don't stay in my ear.I've only had these headphones for a couple days but I can say that the fit is perfect for me, the sound is solid, and they work they way they have been designed. They are very comfortable for me...especially the over-the-ear piece. Don't really know you have them on.Since it's only been a couple days there is still more to learn about the product. Haven't really used it for phone calls other than the initial setup to test functionality. So far so good and as of now I'm very satisfied with this purchase.

Great buds for the money but not perfect


Sound on these are better than average. Better than my Pixel Buds and probably my Skullcandy Uproars. When you get a good seal with the right sized earpieces, there is some decent isolation and the sound is great. Unfortunately I haven't gotten the left bud to fit with my ear so this design isn't perfect and the wire tightener that goes behind your neck is easy to lose (already lost it).I would maybe think twice before purchasing again but overall pretty happy!

Good quality sound.


I'm really enjoying my Senso bluetooth headphones.  The sound quality is actually very good.  It only takes about an hour to fully charge them and they last a good 8 hours on a charge.  Included with the headphones were different size ear buds, a carrying case, and a magnetic car holder for your phone.  The different size ear buds were a nice bonus.  I was able to change the size and they fit perfectly in my ear with no slippage at all.  These are great headphones for the a good price.

A few months of good use, then lots of problems.


I have had these headphones for about 4 months. I have used them probably at least 4 times per week, much of which has been on runs and bike rides. They worked fairly well at first, but recently I have been having issues:-The charging indicator hasn't been working, so I'm not sure if they're charging or not when plugged in.-They have starting to lose signal repeatedly while on bike rides, to the point where eventually they just connect/disconnect constantly so that the audio doesn't have time to come through for more than a second.-They no longer connect to my laptop.It seems that they are just starting to fail in general, and soon won't be usable. I don't know if this is a common issue for this product or if mine just happens to be defective. The return-by date has passed, and I'm not sure about the warranty policy, if there is one. I will probably just buy new headphones from a different company.

Poor Quality - Stay Away


So I am at the verge of completing one year with this product and have contacted seller if I can get refund now instead of replacement. This product dies pretty soon!I bought this in August 2017 and it lasted for about 8 months and after that had issues where audio would break if the headphone was kept 2 feet away from iPhone.A replacement was sent in April 2018 and that also had the exact same issue!Another replacement was sent which lasted till 2 days back. And today, it does not even power up and not charging. It was at 70% battery when I used it last!So am not happy with this product :(

Finally they fit small ears


Love my headphones.  I have used them now for a couple months for running and when I travel.  I have really small ears and wasn’t sure if they would fit right or stay in.  Another pair I have they fall out.  So back to this pair I didn’t need to adjust the caps what is on works great.  They block surrounding noise so when I run outside I only put one in.  The sound is great.  I am glad I gave them a chance.  I would highly recommend.

Muffled Sound


I've been hunting for a perfect set of wireless headphones for a while and have gone through many different offerings from Amazon.The different headphones I've tried are Canbor, Phaiser BHS-530, Senso, BFOX and Phaiser BHS-430. I won't go into the pro's and con's of each of these but I will write a review for each of these in their respective listings.The good thing about these headphones were that they were probably the most comfortable of all that I tried. They are very light weight and the rubber is very soft and flexible. They seem very well built and come with some very nice extra wires for charging.What I didn't like about these was the sound. It seems there are a lot of very good reviews for these headphones, so perhaps mine were duds, but it sounded like I was listening to the music through a pillow. It was very muffled, which I assume was because of the IPX7 waterproofing (which pretty much means it they can be submerged and remain functional). On top of that there was a lot of wind noise while running with these, which when mixed with the muffled sound made it difficult to hear. Increasing the volume only made the speakers buzz during bassy songs.I can imagine that in a windless environment such as a gym or workplace these would work great. Unfortunately for me the pro's didn't outweigh the cons.

Good sound quality, work well


I've had these for a few months now and I love them. They are not as good a noise blocking as some others I have had but they sound great and are convenient. I have to turn the volume up a little more than I like when mowing the lawn but other than that they are perfect. I love them for my workouts on the exercise bike. When I put on other headphones I miss the quality of the sound these offer, that is saying something when it comes to bluetooth headphones.

I've had these for nearly 3 years,  the sound quality is about what you'd expect for such a cheap product: bassy but muddy. Passable. But the battery life,  wow. 3 years on using them almost every day at work and i still get a full 8 hour day on a single charge.  Don't know if i just got lucky or what,  but for under $25 that's an incredible value.

Love the bass and clarity of both bass and treble. If you don't like too much bass. You can just switch out the ear gel size for a smaller one and the bass will lessen. The great thing is this is already provided. I personally like alot of bass and I'm a super happy customer. It also fits comfortably. Also pretty cool that it comes with its own case and a key chain. 😊

Great headphones for the price


I purchased these for running with and a more cost effective version of the beats. They work jut great, sound is good, last ages on single charge and are well made. I am very pleased with them and the only downside can be if your out in the wind, they pick up wind noise badly, so best for inside gym work or outside on calmer days, otherwise brilliant wireless headphones at a great price. I’ll be buying a second pair for traveling.

BLUETOOTH GOOD FOR LOUNGING....NOT ANY MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER


Only giving it 1-star because it works when you aren't moving. If you are wanting to sit on the couch and listen to the game, these are good. On the flip side, if you want to do any time of movement, such as running or biking, DO NOT BUY THESE. They cut in and out constantly. You can't even hear the music. Better off spending for money for quality ones than these, the ones Amazon Suggested. Not worth you wasting money. I am going to return them and get my money back.

These have changed.  Beware.


I had these before and they were great. they got crushed accidentally. I bought again to find that the part that goes over your ear is now rubber with a metal wire in it. I constantly have to reshape it and 30 days into me using them this rubber and wire combo is failing. The last set had a very nice flexible plastic piece that retained its shape well.  The sound is great but the over the ear part IMO is terrible.

The Real Deal


I run a small car audio company and I know sound.  I will tell you right now,  after going through 5 sets of crappy bluetooth headphones, these are the closest your going to get to Beats without spending a fortune.*Update After a year and 4 months, the left side wire is finally starting to develop a short. Turn your head to the left and it will come back on. If I would've bought the extended 2 year warranty I would have a new pair right now.

Okay, I don't know WHY it took me so long to get wireless headphones for my training runs.  I am a distance runner, and I was so used to having wired headphones, but they kept popping out of my ears while running.  I have only used these once, and need to figure out how to ""shorten"" the cord so that it doesn't hit against my neck with every step, but there is a round cord thing that I assume is to be used for that exact purpose.  I'm in the middle of training for a marathon, so this will be used heavily for the rest of the summer and into my fall training.  If there are any changes, I will update my review.

Very nice packaging. Comes with everything you need to get started along with power cables for the ear buds and your iPhone/android phones too with a car power adapter. Give them a charge and listen. Btw don't judge the sound quality right away, while quite good to start with, they do get better after a few hrs of use. All in all, these 5 star reviews aren't a fluke, or SENSO employees, these seem to be a really nice Bluetooth earbud especially at this price point.

I can say without question that I am a Bluetooth aficionado if not Bluetooth expert. As I sit here I can think of 5 pairs of Bluetooth headphones that I own right now but I'm sure there have been more. I bought these senso headphones because it is the one style I have never tried; that being the over the ear with small wire connection. Also, my go to pair until I got the senso pair is being held together with tape and glue and they are getting pretty ugly. I was quite pleased with the quality feel of these headphones. It seems like they were built well and should last for sometime. I like how they connected and I like the buttons. I will not speak about the sound since I am using them for podcasts not music but I will say they sound every bit as good as all the Motorola and others I have owned. Five stars for build quality and ease of use. Throw in comfortable too. If they break or let me down I will re-review.

and extremely comfortable on my ears


Every other review thus far is correct. I prefer these headphones to most others that I have, first off they're wireless, and extremely comfortable on my ears, just gotta make sure you find the best bud size for your ear holes, like for me I have 1 smaller than the other. Sound quality is great, they may not say HD sound, but the quality is great. They cancel out noise very well, I wear them when I'm using the blower in the backyard and they're better than ear plugs/plus I can listen to music. Overall an awesome buy, much worth it.Edit: after 4 months of use they stopped taking a charge. No matter which cable I use, or port I plug it into. Bring that they were 25 bucks,  I decided to order another pair. Price is now 37 dollars,  but what can I do? For an inexpensive pair of headphones,  they're still worth it. If I have any issue with this next set their will definitely be a negative review,  but I account it to wear and tear.

I've had these earphones for about a week and so far so good.  They are much better than the Altec Lansing earphones they replaced.  They have no problem syncing with my iPhone and do so whenever they're turned on.  Sound quality is good and they fit securely over the ear.  The only small complaint I have is that they don't seem so work well with Siri. Siri's generally low-end-of-mediocre performance seems to become poor when I'm using these headphones.  Otherwise, I would recommend them.

Nice and light, with a little too much bass.


As far as bluetooth headphones go, these are pretty decent. The best thing about them is how well they stay in your ears. You can do some pretty intense movement without them moving at all. Very comfortable to wear, and the battery life is more than decent.The only complaint I have is with the amount of bass these things put out. It tends to drown out the treble almost completely. Don't even think about watching movies on your phone with them, unless you like to listen to people talk under water. Maybe I am just used to my Skullcandy headphones... Even adjusting my equalizer on my Galaxy S7 doesn't do much to help with this issue.All in all, I am happy with the purchase for using when I run, bike, or workout.

Happens with amazon video, CD music in the computer cd player, or you tube. Volume for amazon video or you tube needs to be adjusted very low for acceptable listening.3.

Pros- Material is of high quality and is holding up during sweaty gym sessions  - Battery life is as advertised with a solid 8 hours  - Comes with a nice little case to protect the headphone  - Three sizes of plugs for your ears comes with it for maximum comfortCons- Sound is only ok, for most songs it does the job well but when tested with heavy beat it shows its price tag  - When it gets close to being dead (about 10% battery) an annoying voice tells you its about to die every 30 seconds.Overall a great product for the low price tag.

I haven't given them a good workout yet, but the audio quality on them seems great. The only thing I am having a little bit of trouble with is people complaining they are having a hard time hearing me. The mic is built into one of the earbuds and that seems to be a slight disadvantage over other types of headsets. But the good far outweighs the ever so slight negative.

They didn't ever sound very good, and I always had to keep adjusting them around my ear to be able to hear what was playing. I would have to turn them up all the way. Also, the cable in the back kept snagging on everything, including my own skin. I tried using the little black cable clips to shorten the cable, but they were too flimsy, fell off, and couldn't be adjusted without completely redoing them.After a while, the right side started kept getting quieter until there was only a faint sound coming from them. I assumed I had gotten some ear wax on the speaker and tried to very gently brush them off with some paper towel. They promptly died after that.

First wireless headphones, great buy!


These wireless headphones perform very well. They are comfortable, easy to set up, and very light weight.  The volume control works very well and can be adjusted very loud so if you are in noisy places you should have no problem hearing. The only thing that did not make me give it 5 Stars was the range. The range is limited to about 30 feet but also if I had it in one of my pockets and my body was blocking the signal to the headphones, the audio would break up.  Other than that, being my first set of wireless headphones I am very pleased.

I ordered the Bluetooth 250 Senso Activbuds. They arrived very quickly and I love them! They’re very comfortable and the sound is very good. They paired up to my iPhone and to my Samsung Player very easily. I haven’t used them near water yet but I’m sure that they won’t disappoint me. I also like the case that came with them. It’s so easy now to keep them safe while I carry them in my purse. I’m thinking about ordering another pair!

Great Value and Amazing Sound!


My beats had broken and so I turned to Amazon for a different pair. After reading reviews, I purchased these ones. Overall the sound is incredible and it comes with additional ear buds so you can change for comfort. The battery life is way better than my beats so that has been a huge perk. They don't fit well to my ears when I run, but then again any headphone purchase like this is a risk. I definitely recommend though, and for the price you can't beat the sound and the additional items that help to enhance your purchase.

I thought for the price it would be just one more run of the mill type of thing. Wrong. Sounds is clear, earbuds cover nicely around, ear holder is soft and it does not interfere with my prescription glasses. With one charge I listened to salsa from 12pm to 4:00pm on my flight to the Caribbean without interrupting sound. However, wish somehow the device can tell me how much juice is still left. But can complaint for the price.

Excellent product and customer service


The headphones are top notch.  Unfortunately, there was a ""crackle"" in one ear.  After sending an email to customer support on a Saturday night, I received a helpful response within just 2 hours!  The quality of the customer service was excellent--responsive, quick, and competent.  After troubleshooting proved ineffective, I've just received a replacement set of headphones that work perfectly.  Would highly recommend this item--both for the earbuds, as well as in case of the unforeseen likelihood that you encounter any problems.  I've honestly never been so impressed with customer service--they take it extremely seriously.  I highly recommend this product (and the company).

Definitely Worth $36


UPDATE:  The headphones after 8 months of use decided to die on me.  No worries because they have a one year warranty that customer service was more than happy to replace them at no cost.  The only complaint I have is when changing speeds/direction while running and jumping the last month of use the headphones were starting to cut out and this may have been a precursor them dying on me.  I would highly recommend the 4 year warranty for $9.These headphones for the $36 I paid for them are worth every penny.  The sound is good.  They are comfortable/lightweight and don't move while running or during HIIT workouts.  The accessories are what really got me though.  The package came with two USB chargers one short mini USB and the other is a iPhone/mini USB combo charger and also a car charger.  Would never pay the original $169.99 but would pay $50 or a little more if I could've tested them out first.

I keep rebuying!


I love these headphones. The cost is very forgiving, as I keep losing them and rebuying them. Great for running and the gym as well as phone calls for work in a loud cube farm. One criticism: they sometimes turn on in your bag if you just throw them in there, which depletes the batteries and potentially routes calls through headphones unexpectedly. If you use the case they come in for storage this will not occur.

Ok


Power on button no longer worked as of aug 21 from purchase in February Battery life is ok for workouts but I can't say for work. I work in loud environment so the noise level is moderate high for music and battery last around 6 hours roughly. My main gripe is the static and chatter connecting to my phone via Bluetooth. It isn't every time but enough to cause aggravation. Fit is good and controls are fine. $30 set of headphones is what you get....

Charging Port Failure


Really enjoyed using these headphones while doing yard work but after a few months of use, the charging port would no longer accept the cable to charge.  I'm assuming something is bent inside but I can't see it.  I felt they were comfortable, held a good charge and the sound quality was acceptable for what I used them for.  However, due to the charging port issue, I would not purchase again.

I use these every day.  They don't fall out of my ears on my runs.  The sound is adequate for my needs.  I am not an audio expert by any stretch of the imagination, so can't say ""oh the sound is wonderful, blah blah blah,""  They stay in my ears, when I talk on the phone people can hear me.  I don't have to charge them all the time either.  Serving their purpose with no frustration which gets them 5 stars.

Extremely nice Bluetooth earbuds. 8 hour playtime (music), lots of unexpected extras-car charger, long and short usb charging cables. In addition to the traditional multiple size ear inserts, you get a set of ear inserts which are not traditional, they conform lot putty in your ear and are very comfortable. The best base I've ever heard in a wireless Bluetooth set up ever. The set comes nicely packaged and include a carrying case. Waterproof and high quality, I love them.

Very Good Headphones!


These are one of the best headphones I've ever had. the sound is great, very clear. The volume, WOW. They are LOUD. The downside is that the bass is a little to much for me. Luckily I have a media app where I can adjust the equalizer. So if you can consider that. As far as fit, they don't fall out at all. Of course unless you pull them but even then the hook will catch them and you can just pop them back in. Another downside is the media button is right in line with your ear canal so somtimes you'll push it in further than you would like, but that's compromise for not having anything on the cord. Overall very satisfied with my purchase. The only reason this is a 4 star is because the bass was too much. They need an app where you can adjust the headphones them self. Then they are 5 stars!

I have only had these headphones a couple days now, but I must say they are fantastic. They connected to my phone right out of the box and I didn't have any issues connecting to other devices. The sound is rich and bassy, and the headphones themselves fit comfortably into my ears. They charge quick and last a long, long time. I used them both outside and inside, and they cancelled just about all the noises. I am also pleased with the charging cables/dc adapter/carrying case. All in all, these are a fantastic buy!

Good headphones, but only if your devices are on the right side


I've had these headphones well over a year now, I like them a lot. sound is good, stay in the ear nearly all the time.There is one thing I hate about them.The Bluetooth antennae is only in the right ear!So if you wear a smartwatch on your left wrist, or put your smartphone in your left pocket, it will drop the connection, A LOT.These things would be perfect if it had a unified antennae on both ears.

Battery lasts for a long time and automatically pairs with my phone. Great packaging and fun little free accessories that they throw in. I bought a set of beats for 120 bucks and returned them to get another pair of these.  I did a side-by-side comparison on sound quality and full rich bass and I was amazed that the Dr. Dre beats we’re not nearly as good.  I even bought two pairs of the sensos this Bluetooth headset is outstanding. Excellent sound quality good Bass. Battery lasts for a long time and I medically pairs with my phone.

I love these headphones for their comfort and sound quality.  When I am sitting up or lying down on my back they are fantastic and all the buttons work wellI just had cervical surgery and cannot move my neck to read so am listening to audio books.  When I turn on my side while in bed, the on/off button turns on and off with the movement of my head/ ear so side listening doesn't work for me.  Wish the buttons were on the wire.But yet again these are very high quality headphones.

The sound pretty good but your phone (or whatever device you use) can't be more than a foot away before it starts breaking up!  I can't even have it in my back pocket while doing yard work without it breaking up!  I'm considering returning them for this reason.Well, well...the day I wrote this and complained of their quality just happened to be the day the return window closed!  Coincedence?  I think not!

It's ""OK"".......


I wanted to try wireless headphones for the gym and bought these on the strength of their reviews.  Easy to use, lightweight, not the worlds greatest sound but I wasn't expecting too much.The problem I have with them is the fit.  The ear pieces are really flexible, and I wonder if something stiffer and maybe adjustable for shape might be better.  Now here's the weird thing-one ear fits fine, and the other doesn't.  I have never noticed that I have deformed ears, but I'll be darned if I can get the right side to fit as well as the left.All in all, an OK purchase, but I'm not giving it 5 stars.....

Gives a New Meaning to Chopped and Screwed Music


Ok, so I've tried to love these...and I do; partially.  The headphones drop signal very easily.  I can have my phone in a holster on my arm, in my pocket, or strapped to my chest and if you turn your head, jog to hard or your shirt covers the phone, it will make the music/connection very choppy.  I find myself turning off the head phones, and just blaring music through the phone speaker.  It is a definite headache, while working out, or doing outdoor work.

Stopped working after only using only a few times, warranty not honoured


Only had a few days to play with these so far but initial impression is very favourable. The cable that fits between the 2 earpieces is nimble and light, which means it doesnt cause a nuisance at al when running etc. The sound is very clear, and the volume is pretty decent too. Good solid fit with the over the ear hooks.Battery time i got just under 6 hours from my first charge. Was hoping for a bit more than that, given that my phone and the earphones were both in a static position the whole length of my test. But overall very happy with these earphones. Solid build too.UPDATE: 23rd Oct 2018. Had these 10 months, only used about 4 times (they were purchased as part of a review of 5 different headphones). My initial reaction was very good (as per my review above), but after only 4 uses originally, i returned to use them today for the first time in months, and they dont charge. The charging light doesnt come on. Tried differnt charging cables etc - definitely the unit is faulty. Contacted the seller and they are refusing to replace them, or refund. Hence my rating has gone from 5 to 1. Why? It doesn't matter how good a product is, if it breaks after only a few uses then it is basically useless and a complete waste of money.

Product is as expected - and I had pretty high expectations...


Primary purpose for these is for work outs.  So far so good.  I have had some trouble fitting one ear, although I've tried all three sizes - I suspect my ear is not formed to create the same secure feel that the other one does with these very standard buds.  Fortunately, the buds are light enough that with this design, I'm not having any issue keeping it in my ear.  Have yet to try the microphone for quality in use with my phone.  Will update the review if there's an issue there.

Start by saying I've only been using these for a week, however they have completely exceeded my expectations. I've been using Plantronics Backbeat Fits for several years and have been pleased but a pair recently broke which led me to this purchase. They are 5x louder than my Plantronics and fit much nicer. Bass is booming (I've had to turn down bass a touch for my liking). I have done a week full of very intense HIIT style workouts and they have not fallen out. Highly recommend!

I would say these headphones sound really good. They are comfortable up to about two hours


I would say these headphones sound really good. They are comfortable up to about two hours, but what ear buds aren't? For the price, they work great. However, and this is the bad part, the Bluetooth range is about 6 feet. I tried on my iPhone and my Mac and when I walked away, they broke up something fierce. The cables hey send are great. But the small one doesn't work with my Mac. I plug the cable into my Mac and then into my phone, and it connects and disconnects every half second. I should not complain as this is just an added accessory to these earphones.After I bought these, I got an email from the owner thanking me for my purchase. He asked if I had any issues that I should reply to his email. I did. Four days passed and nothing. Great effort on the customer service but fail on the response.Pros: they sound great and are comfortable.Cons: don't get up to get a beer without a loss of signal.I have it three stars because Bluetooth technology should have a greater range. It appears that line of sight is all these headphones can handle.UPDATE: It appears that my range is limited on my Mac. I tried something different on my iPhone 6 and the range was much better. I have an older Mac, so that may be the issue. I left my iPhone in my bedroom and went to the kitchen (30 feet and 2 walls away) and the sound was still great. I changed from three to four stars because of this. Also, it comes with a bunch of extra ear buds. Not too shabby.

Connectivity Issues - would not repurchase.


I love having wireless headphones. However, getting these to connect to my iphone can be difficult. Sometimes, it connects fine and other times I have to go into my phone settings and disconnect and reconnect in order to get them to work. It will be connected but then play my music through the phone speakers but will pause and play through the headphone button - what the heck! It's really annoying when it disconnects when I'm driving and I can't fix it. Three stars because they are just okay and sound quality is fine. I wouldn't purchase again though. I'll look for another brand that doesn't have these connectivity issues.

Great set of headphones for the price. Extras are a bonus!


Really, really pleased with these headphones. I've only had them for a few days, but they're exactly what I was hoping for. Super comfortable to wear (the over-ear hooks feel like they're not there). They're great at blocking outside noise (they make a good seal in your ear). They're a little heavy on the bass/low frequencies, but that doesn't bother me. I'd prefer it to the tinny sound you often get with more inexpensive headphones.The packaging is nice. It's a superficial thing, but I feel like it shows more care for the product and customer if packaging is more than an afterthought.I really like that they came with a carrying case. My last set of headphones went through the wash because I had kept them in a cargo pocket and forgot about them. That won't happen now.

-Sound quality is deep and rich-Battery life can practically last a full days use,-Headphones fit mostly secure but could be better as while I know they won't come off, they still feel somewhat look around the ear. (Could because it makes it more comfortable for the user)-Small travel pouch is nice with a secure outer protection layer-Multi port cord set is a nice complementary addition-Nice touch with the multiport car charger for the headphones as well*One thing I'd fix(Possible smaller sized ear bud attachments than what was given to choose from) When wearing the ear buds, within a hour or less they can start to irritate my inner ears and this is without running but medium movement during my working hours.

Comfortable, lightweight, loud. These are a great value. You definitely get your money's worth. They syn easily during set up and immediately every time I use them.

These are a really great answer to the need for wireless headphones that are not too bulky and are good for working out.

Function and build quality simply not good


This Bluetooth headset is a joke. I bought it cause of the positive reviews but it’s a piece of plastic junk. There was a steady hiss coming from both ear pieces as I listened to music. The build quality seems very cheap. After 2 days normal and gentle use, the left ear piece split open as if they were put together with a very cheap glue or adhesive. I regret spending my money on these and was so angry and disappointed I just threw them in the garbage. I recommend you spend a little more money for a better quality Bluetooth headset.

Worked fine at first


So I bought these headphones because I wanted a decent set to workout in the gym with. For the first couple months they worked pretty well. The sound quality is okay but worth it for the price but 6 months later they dont work. They keep beeping and disconnecting. I tried charging them and the beeping still occured. I also tried unpairing the blue tooth and repairing but the issue persists. I do not think these headphones are worth the money honestly.

So far, so good! Only used them a couple of times so far. They paired easily, stayed in my ears during a workout (treadmill running, weight machines, bench press, etc.), and the sound quality is good. The ear loops are pretty floppy, so they feel like they might fall out, but that haven't yet. Sound is as good as expected. Obviously gonna be a little weak in the Bass, but no static or hissing due to the wireless.Will update this as I get more use out of these.

Left speaker on this item stopped working after 6 months of use. When I tilt my head slightly to the side it cuts out. I have asked for a replacement because it has 1 year warranty. Once I get the product I will update this review. The charge does not stay for 8 hours. At best 3 to 4 hours of continuous play. So its falsely misrepresented in the description

Great product for the price


I ordered these to wear at the gym and I was very happy with the product, the sound is great especially for the price, even better than $175 pair that I had. But on that note do to me sweating at the gym the first pair failed But I contacted the cellar/ manufacturer and they replace them pretty fast for me and II bear have been great.

GREAT QUALITY!


I LOVE THESE EARBUDS!  I tried others and kept returning them due to poor quality all around.  These have great sound, made well and stay in place while spinning, running, etc.  I have a pair of BEATS HEADPHONES that cover your entire ear and these are a close second to the sound and more comfortable to work out in.  Do not get fooled into spending hundreds of dollars when you can have the quality you want at a much cheaper price!  I highly recommend these!

Audio quality was absolute garbage


I don't know if I just got a faulty unit, but I'm not about to find out. The audio was muffled and sounded like it was underwater. Even the built-in ""Your headset is now connected"" recording sounded terrible. It sounded like someone had stuck cotton in the earbuds and I was hearing the audio through it. Complete waste of money.

Excellent for listening to music


Very comfortable to wear. They actually stay in my ears no matter the activity. Love the access to music and how good it sounds. The price was just right. This is the first pair I have had. It paired with my phone instantly. I actually bought this set to use for phone conversations. I am slight disappointed in the quality of the live voice but the use for listening to music more than makes up for this issue. I would reccoment this set for anyone wanting to exercise or relax while listening to music.

So happy again. Issue hasn't happened again


I had only one issue after about two weeks of use. My cell suddenly wouldn't connect or recognize the headset. I was bummed and tried and retried every which way that the little instruction manual was suggesting. Message kept saying 'Connection failed"".But I finally just deleted the ""Active Buds"" from my bluetooth device list, and it reappeared with a reset.So happy again.  Issue hasn't happened again. But if it does, I'll know what to do.Just simply a great bluetooth headset. Especially for the price!

Decent for the money


So far so good with these. I bought them specifically for long runs. Batteries have lasted for them but I noticed if my phone is too far from them the music skips. And by far I mean I hold it lower than my waist. But for $30 you can't beat that.However I was missing a piece in the package when I received it and contacted the company. They immediately sent a replacement piece to make it right. Great customer service.

Worth every penny!!


Received a few hours ago and was excited to give them a go. I bought these to keep in my car and use when I'm out and about and don't have my other headphones. I have a few higher end pairs that I use at the gym and around the house. The sound quality is not the same, but I didn't expect them to be. With that said though the sound quality isn't bad. For what I paid I got more than expected on my end though. They fit really well. Comes with different size earbuds, car charger (lightening and Micro USB adapter), USB charger for the earbuds and a case. Happy with the purchase. Feels like a steal at this price.

Senso Makes Work Outs Zoom By


I'm really impressed with the quality of my new Senso Bluetooth earbuds.  I use mine for working out and the music quality is crisp and clear.  The ear loops keep them in place and the different tips make for a comfortable fit for me.  The buttons on top are small but I set mine up and use my watch to control songs and volume so that's not a concern for me.  I noticed Senso has another model with a larger red multi function button which you might consider if this is a concern for you.  I love the carrying case that I can slip in my gym bag and protect my earbuds when I carry them.  Also appreciate getting two charging cords and a car charger.  My friend told me he uses his Senso earbuds for running marathons because the battery doesn't die.  The only thing I wonder about is the rubber cover over the charging port.  It seems a bit flimsy and I wonder how it will hold up.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  I never expected this quality for the price.

Value, great sounding, but prepare for some skips.


I got these headphones because of the outstanding reviews.The Good:These are value for sure. With all the items included, good luck finding anything else on Amazon that is comparable. These aren't noise canceling, but it's fine. The bass is strong and the sound quality is better than my wired xiaomi headphones, so it definitely feels like I got an upgrade.The Bad:I am getting skips in my headphones if I have my phone in my pants pocket. I am 5'11"", so the distance between my phone and the headphones is less than 3 feet. If I keep my phone in my jacket pocket (roughly 2 feet distance), the skips disappear. I'm pretty sure my pant pockets aren't lined with lead, so my guess is that anything beyond 2 feet allows for skips. Also, sometimes when I turn my head, there's a skip or two that occurs, so there might be some wiring issue.Overall, I can't complain for something that I spent $30 on.

Lasted 9 months


They worked fairly well but would often just cut in and out for no reason.  They also picked up a lot of wind noise when outside and walking or jogging into the wind.  But today they stopped charging after less than 9 months of use.  Maybe I shouldn't expect much for the price, but at least of year of use is not too much to ask.I also could not pair them to a bluetooth transmitter I bought for my TV.  Apparently they don't support the A2DP profile so I couldn't use them to listen to TV when my wife was trying to sleep.

The bass is good but not what more can you expect from earbuds


The sound volume is the most decent bluetooth I've ever owned, louder than all the previous earbuds I've had.  The bass is good but not what more can you expect from earbuds.  Hugs my ear pretty well and comfortable.  Now that being said, I don't like this cause I workout, work and train a lot.  The sound cuts in and out A LOT!  If I'm not moving from spot to spot the sound doesn't cut out, but if I walk around... then it clicks, cuts out like a scratched CD.  CD?  What's that?

The Senso Bluetooth Headphones came a day after I ordered them.  The directions provided were easy to follow and I was able to quickly sync the headphones to my Android phone.  They were easy to adjust, and I liked that three pairs of tips were provided so I could customize my listening experience.  A compact case is provided and it's protective enough that I can throw it in my purse or backpack without worrying about damage to my headphones.  Finally, they were inexpensive and the best wireless headphones I've owned.

Great headphones


Arrived yesterday. Started using them today at the gym. Ran on the treadmill for an hour. Did some workouts. They never fell out of the ear. Not even sweating was a problem. I have couple different headphones(samsung, lg, iphone) and those always fell out of the ear, specially when working out and sweating. This are great, just perfect. Great sound and very loud. Noise cancellation is great, it works if you crank the volume up but at low still work well. Not the best producing bass but I love this headphones. This are the best headpones for the price I have tried.

Great sound, long charge life and superb customer service.


These have been great headphones!  I bought them in September and yesterday they quit charging and I called Customer Service to see what the problem was, after trouble shooting he determined they are defective and will be replacing them since they was a 1 year warranty!  I was pleasantly surprised! Good customer service is hard to come by these days, so that was really nice, that he tried to fix them and when he couldn't he said  they will be sending me a replacement. These headphones have great sound and make blue tooth easy. I was bummed when they wouldn't charge and feel lost without my headphones.  I use these for watching TV at night, listening to music at work, with my laptop and phone. I can't wait to get the new ones Senso is sending me. I would recommend these headphones.

Great Budget Earbuds


The SENSO Bluetooth headphones are a solid pair of headphones. They have a very nice sound for a lower end headphone. They also come with a good bit of accessories, which is always a nice touch.The only complaints I have is that the bass can be a little weak, which is to be expected of a cheaper pair of headphones, and they aren't the most secure headphones. While they remain on your ear, there is no pressure keeping them in your ear so they can come loose at times.

Bad quality control and bad product.


I was surprised that after a weeks use that it stopped working. I could charge it but when I took it off the charger it flashed red and blue lights consistently and there was nothing I could do to correct the issue. I say I was surprised because I understand that these aren't supposed to be the best Bluetooth headphone but the reviews made them seem great. They were not. The sound was muffled, Bluetooth broke out terribly when my phone was just in my back pocket and then they just stopped working.I don't recommend buying these headphones.

So good, my wife got me 2


These things are so good, my wife let me buy 2 for the inevitable day that I destroy one of them. First, let me say that I'm no normal blue tooth earbud consumer. To be honest, I have more blue tooth headphones than my wife has purses (not quite shoes). The biggest problem I have with earbuds is the inability to stay in ones ear when doing activities. Usually, even if there is an over the ear cord of some kind holding the earbuds up, they still come out of my ear hole. Lets just say, with the SENSO Bluetooth Headhones, I haven't had one time where I've had to push the earphones back in my ear.Pros:1. Fantastic for audiobooks and any music heavy on bass. At no point have I heard any distortion from overpowering the speakers.2. The audio is definitely not that flat treble tone you hear with most bluetooth earbuds.3. The over the ear rubber parts are comfortable while not being so tight that you can only wear for a few hours a day.4. Battery lasts for about 8 hours of semi-continuous use. It would probably last longer if I turned the volume down on the device from time to time.5. Pairs quickly to my Samsung Galaxy 8 and Windows 10 USB Bluetooth 4.0 dongle(
[2 Year Warranty] Avantree USB Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter for PC, Wireless Dongle, for Stereo Music, VOIP, Keyboard, Mouse, Support All Windows 10 8.1 8 7 XP vista
)6. Recharges in 1-2 hours on standard cellphone chargers or the included car charger7. Price at time of my purchase was 70% less than retail which made it so much better.8. Wife saw how much I liked them and bought me a backup pair.9. I can swim with dolphins while listening to tunes. Need I say more?Con:1. Microphone doesn't pick up voices well. It probably works better if you have a higher pitched voice.2. Color options would have been nice.

... are worth the price you pay and have both good things and bad things about them


These headphones are worth the price you pay and have both good things and bad things about them. Let me first start the review by saying I have owned these headphones for a year and they just completely died. So when ordering, please keep in mind that this purchase might be annually based upon my experience.The Good: Easy to use and setup, didn't feel too awkward when wearing, sound quality was good, battery life was pretty goodThe Bad: Ear straps do not help support, buttons will break or get stuck at times to prevent usage, additional items included in purchase are a wasteThese headphones died when i was using them at the gym one day and I heard this loud noise like a fire alarm going off for a brief second (sound came from headphones). Once the sound stopped, they never turned back on.

Declining Durability


I have ordered these headphones twice in 2 years. They fit great and have great sound quality. However, as someone who sweats a lot, I require resilient sports headphones and have gone through several pairs in the past that break after a few uses. The first pair of SENSO headphones I bought broke due to the charging port breaking. I could not longer charge the headphones so I replaced them after a year of use. I purchased the second pair two months ago. The headphones have a strange connectivity problem where they disconnect after around 30 minutes, and I am unable to re-pair with my phone until I use them again the next day. I assume this is a sweat related problem, but I could be wrong. Still very frustrating to be halfway through a workout and have working headphones that cannot pair with my phone. I've determined the problem is not with the phone. Additionally, the battery life of this second pair is about half what it was with my first pair. Not sure what happened to SENSO over the last year...

But I gotta say that these headphones are one of the best, if not


I have tried many headphones, from the cheapest ones you can buy from Walgreens to one of the highest end that cost over $100. But I gotta say that these headphones are one of the best, if not, the best I've ever gotten. They're easy to put on and fit perfectly inside my ears. They also come with different size earbuds so there should be a set that should fit your ears too. You can change the volume while listening to music on the headphones and even skip or go to previous song as well. These headphones play music really loud and still keeps it at a pretty good clarity. I usually don't have them set at the highest volume since they're just really good at about 75% it's highest volume works for me. On top of that, the noise cancelation  works really great as far as these kinds of headphones. And since these are waterproof, these are perfect for while taking a run. If you you're looking for good headphones for running, working out or even just to listen to music in general, I promise you won't regret buying these. Plus these come with a 1 year warranty. Again, I've really tried many other headphones and I would buy these again if I ever need another one later.

Still searching for the perfect headphones, but these are the best so far...


I do love these bluetooth headphones. Out of the three brands I've tried, these are my favorites. They are the only ones that I can seem to stay in my ears, although they do have to be readjusted every few minutes or so while running. The others I've tried just fall out within seconds. The sound quality is great, and my phone can be up to 15 yards away with no interruption. I can use these for one hour a day at the gym and only need to charge once a week. The ear piece is very malleable, so they are comfortable, and surprisingly stays put. Other than having to readjust every few minutes with vigorous activity, these are perfect.

Reliable, comfortable, good sound at 3 weeks and counting - Impressed!


On week 3 and so far so very good.  Sound is good - for me comparable to Beats.  Holds a charge for about a week (which for me is 6-7 hrs).  Comfy. I actually like the soft silicone ear wraps.  They irritate less than the hard plastic of Beats. Pairing with my iPhone was trivially easy and smooth.  Has a 1 yr warranty, which alleviated my concern about trying such an inexpensive product.  If these keep on working over the course of several months, I will up this to 5 star review.

Great battery life, decent audio quality.


These are great for the average music listener or if you're looking for a set you don't mind getting beat up. For me, they're OK on a job site because I don't mind them getting dirty or scratched up. As a minor audiophile, the sound quality isn't there. But that's not why I bought these. Tinny bass, no noise cancellation (they don't claim to have this feature, though), and they like to not stay in place in the ear. But again, buy a high end set if you need better. These are great for what they are. But the battery life, goes a couple days without needing a recharge! These are perfect for my needs.

Lots of bang for a little bit of buck.


I base my award of 5 stars on the issue of value.  For the price, these are an excellent choice.  The sound quality is better than average, which is, to my mind, more than what I paid for.  So no, these are not studio quality headphones, but they are far above adequate to my amateurish ear.  They also come with quite a lot of extras, such as a car charger and multiple sets of earbuds.  My only question is durability, which will only be answered with time.  So far, after only a few days of use, I'm impressed.

Overall I found the Senso headphones to be a solid value. Sound quality is on par with the more expensive brands, battery life is good, and the microphone works well. Their warranty and customer support was top notch. My headphones died after 7 months and I contacted their support team, after some trouble shooting it was determined that they were no longer functional. A replacement pair arrived 3 days later. They backed their product 100%, and resolved the issue timely. Because of the support I received, I'd recommend Senso to anyone.

Few Upsides, Glaring Flaws


Pros:Very easy to setup.Volume buttons on the right ear also work for skipping tracks, which was very convenient.Micro USB port on the right ear allowed me to charge the earbuds with my phone charger.Cons:The big bulge that bridges the hook and the bud was very uncomfortable as it pressed against my ear. I couldn't stand to wear them more than 30 minutes at a time.The sound quality was acceptable..Wind very easily drowns out the sound, so I would strongly recommend not wearing them on a bike ride.Full charge lasted ~4 hours.

I was hooked, except for the hooks!


These headphones would have been perfect for what I wanted, but the ear hooks were too flexible (which did not feel secure) and the hooks sat too high and in front of my ears when the buds were put in securely. That's my only gripe about them.The quality and bass were very impressive, better than what I expected for the price. Because the sound was so good IMO with these headphones I am trying a different pair without hooks.

If you don't want to spend a ton of money on a wireless set of headphones I would highly recommend these.


These produce plenty of sound and are very clear when I am stationary.  I bought these for when I ride my bike.  I went on a 4hour ride this weekend and there was almost zero ear discomfort, the battery also lasted the entire ride.  My only complaint was wind noise, I was only riding at around 15mph and there was definite noise coming through.  I just had to turn out my music another notch and it made it much nicer.I had zero issue with the music cutting in or out.  I was even able to walk about 40-50 feet away from my phone, line of site, before it started to cut out.If you don't want to spend a ton of money on a wireless set of headphones I would highly recommend these.

Comfortable and secure in the ear although a bit bulky


Comfortable and secure in the ear although a bit bulky. All controls are on right earphone and are easily accessible. Charging slot cover doesn't always stay in place. Doesn't always work if phones are 30' away from main unit. Anything closer than 30' they work flawlessly. Charging is quick and simple. Haven't yet maximized the battery usage to see if I can get 8 hrs. of battery life as claimed. Noise cancellation is acceptable but don't expect 100%. The phone connection feature is also acceptable. Only used the earphones several days so I can't comment on longevity. However the unit feels and looks solid and of good construction. Most importantly for anyone using earphones to listen to music...The sound is EXCELLENT. Bass, treble, separation... all working as good or better than any other much more expensive earphones I have used in the past.

It's good, but not great


I like having this wireless apparatus, but the design has some problems. The controls are all on the side of the right ear (no problem at all), but the buds don't stay quite stable in the ear. When I want to adjust the fit, it's impossible to manipulate the right-ear bud comfortably without pressing one of the control buttons, which discontinues whatever I'm listening to. Not great.

OMG! OMG! These things are beyond! I am old school (and 53!) and continued wearing over the head 80's style head phones when everybody had turned to ear buds. My experience with then was the sound quality was garbage and they kept falling out. Finally I decided to get modern and got behind the neck ear phones on the ear. But no one wore these and the behind the neck thing was bothersome so I finally got real modern and got these.OMG! The bass the quality. Still cannot really believe it.

These go bad after a while for unknown reasons.They claim to be ""sports"" earphones, and for several months, they are the best workout ear buds I can find.Then, for some unknown reason, after somewhere between two and three months, they simply will NOT charge.It would be great if they'd figure out why, because they are otherwise exceptionally good buds.

Good sound but a few problems


The sound is pretty good, but I have noted two problems.  One is that everything is controlled by pushing a single button some number of times.  In addition to controlling on and off, it signals your phone to call the most-recent number.  I have accidentally done this a few times.  The other problem is that the headphones occasionally lose the Bluetooth connection momentarily unless the phone is really close, which is annoying when playing music.

Lets face it they are no beats


Lets face it they are no beats. I have had beats before these and the beats are far superior in sound and comfort in my opinion. I actually think they're an ok deal for the money but what really pisses me off is when it beeps and shuts down for no reason, battery will be fully charged. I restarted them and it temporarily fixed the issue but happened again. I also dont like having to push commands on the ear piece. I prefer the commands on the wire.

Not worth buying


asked for wireless earphones, gave all other not necessary stuff.Sound- quality is good. Cannot comment on thatEar buds- not cool. Felt like kept some heavy object in my ear.Mic- worst, kept next to ear buds, need to talk in high volume for others to understand over phone.Charging- said 8hrs but is down after 3hrs of use.I will return it back

Too much wind noise


These were returned because they do not stay in the ear very well, but the main reason was because of wind noise. While walking on a breezy day or running, the wind noise is so bad I couldn't even hear my music. My wife had the same problem with the same set I had bought for her too, so I returned both and bought some Insignia  ""on ear"" style which sound so much better, no wind noise but still able to hear surrounding noises like traffic.

This product is great..


This product is great... And the company is even better.. I bought these SENSO headphone by invotek about six months ago. Great quality sound and quality material from the soft silicon ear hook; hooking over your ear, to the entire headphone.. The best thing is the customer service, the reason I say this is because it comes with a one year warranty and unfortunately I had issues is the unit within six months out of the blue but emailed them around 1am in the morning and they replied within a couple of hours with two more email they emailed me a well really professional and down righ nice letter saying they are sorry to hear that I'm having issue with there product, another email to confirm my address and two days later a got a new unit with no problems.. Will definitely buy from this company again..

Easy to use and good quality sound


I have sensitive ears to objects inserted in them. There have been some of the easiest headphones for me to wear. They also seem to hold a charge for longer than advertised. The headphones are super easy to set up and use and provide much better sound quality than I expected. My only caveat is be aware if you have multiple bluetooth transmissions going at once (my house can have up to 4 devices transmitting at once)....it will probably pick up the device you are closest to first when pairing.

They woork but don't fit well.


I bought these, well this, for work. They work but they don't fit me. The parts that go over the ear are so lose they fall off my ears. No way I could do exercising with these. The range was pretty good, I could go between 30 and 40 feet before losing signal. Sound wasn't awful but I really haven't used them enough to give a good review of the sounds they produce. The case and cord it came with are pretty good imo.

Good earbuds but they have some issues.


Very good battery life, comes with necessary wires as well as replacement for the ear pieces, pairs up to your phone easily, very easy to use because of concise instructions. Some cons that I have include that they hurt my left ear, this could be just me but after wearing them long the left side became very uncomfortable, also the sound quality isnt the greatest ever, it lacks bass for the most part so some songs may sound different than they would when they're played through regular speakers. Overall they are a decent product, id recommend buying if you want some cheap wireless earbuds with long battery life.

Well let me start with they have a nice packaging of their product


Well let me start with they have a nice packaging of their product. Comes with everything you could possible need. Build quality is pretty good. I did not think the ear arms were going to do much good, since they are made of soft flexible rubber. But to my surprise they held very well. They paired very easy with my phone.  Now the down fall of these headphones. They have no mid's or high end. All they have is bloated bass. I guess if you are in to bass heavy music you may not mind. But they just do not sound good. I guess I am not surprised for the $35 I paid for them. I have some other pairs of lower end headphone/ earbuds and they sound way better.

EVERYTHING came in amazing on my runs


I wanted to run with these a few times before I gave any opinion. First, EVERYTHING came in amazing on my runs. I loved the options for different ear buds. The ear loops were very comfortable. The easy access to turn volume up or down was nice. The phone calls that came in were also clear. Charged fairly quick. Loved the carrying case. Only teensy problem was when I ran into the wind, the sound of the wind seemed to be louder. Overall I LOVE these! My first pair of wireless headsets. I bought 2 so I can keep using these.

Performance at rest is good; however once on the move..... not-so-much


So, I purchased these (as a cheaper alternative) to some of the more expensive options.And if you're standing still then they're OK.Connection via BT is steady, sound is generally without lag and performance of battery life seems good.However, I got these specifically for Bike riding. And so far for this purpose these are almost unusable.The buffering heard from the wind-noise makes for nothing but a 'rushing-air' sound in the ear.Almost no sound can be heard with anything past a slow jogging-pace.So cycling at normal pace and trying to listen to anything is almost impossible.I've tried them on two runs and two short bike rides; and ended up reverting back to the old 'apple' wired buds.I've changed the ear fittings but (any) ear-bud should fit comfortably at the ear; and not need to be jammed into the ear to ensure sound.Also, I've noticed the left-side doesn't hold as tight as the Right-ear (although that might be my funny ears)?Generally, I very tempted to return these and try something else.

I didn't like these. They wouldn't stay put hands free in ...


I didn't like these.  They wouldn't stay put hands free in my ears for running, or even walking for that matter.  They just kept flopping out.  I contacted the vendor and was told to try different sized buds, but trying to find a specific bud that stuffs so tight into my ear not only seemed unlikely since the whole ear device piece was so big and clunky, I just can't see it staying in there for a run with that size and nothing else hanging onto it other than a smoosh in the ear if you can find the right size.  I also had a lot of trouble just doing the basic function of connecting the bluetooth to my device.  I had to repeat it about 10 times before it would connect.  I have never returned an item on amazon, this was the first time I've returned something.

So I can't compare them to others but I can compare them to my corded setup and these are superior.So far I have found the sounds to as good or better than my Sienhauser  corded set.

Surprisingly good for the price. Beware if you have small ears.


I was pleasantly surprised by how well these headphones worked given the price.  The sound is not bad, certainly good enough for my daily podcast fix. The range is pretty good, at least 30 ft without any noticeable signal loss. The microphone feature works pretty well with my phone, and the battery lasts for hours. My one quibble is that the design is not well suited to women with smaller ears.  It takes some serious wiggling (not always comfortable) to get them to stay my ears, and the over the ear loops are a bit too large to help out.

Early review, but a coworker has had a pair for a few months. They'd been on my list for a couple of months before I noticed he had them. He gave rave reviews, so I made the order. They are great! Comfortable fit, no noise from movement transferring through the cable, and great sound. I used my phone's equalizer to ""turn down the bass."" I actually used them for 2 hours immediately right out of the box as they were charged. (I wore them for a run and weightlifting.)

Good but could be improved


I bought these for the gym... I get 5 or 6 hour-plus work outs out of them before I need a recharge which isn't bad.  Good quality sound and function.  The only thing that annoys me is that when the battery is low, you get a woman's voice uttering ""battery low"" every minute until your battery dies, which is around 10 minutes later.  It interrupts your music and is very annoying.  One warning is enough... that and the battery life is why I give 4 stars instead of 5.

Faulty & Overpriced at $170


The discount price is enticing, but the quality and selling points are misleading. It is not worth $170, maybe $29 at best.I purchased these ear buds almost a year ago and they stopped working a few weeks ago. I handled them carefully and listened to music at the lowest volume, but the speaker in the left ear bud died before a year of somewhat consistent use.These earbuds are NOT noise cancelling. The volume must be high to block ambient noises.The charging cord is short and suceptible to fraying due to its size.The bluetooth is not reliable and cuts out. I never experienced this with my Bose bluetooth devices, but I experienced this issue constantly with these earbuds. Resetting the earbuds or resyncing the device usually amended the issue, but for a short period.The sound quality is okay, but not worth the full price ($170).If you are okay with inexpensive earbuds ($29), these are a potential choice. However, do not expect the SENSO headphones to be durable or reliable.

Great Customer Service!!


This is going to be a bit of a strange review, because ultimately the headphones didn't work for me.  I was wanting to use them when I did yard work, but found with my phone in my pocket that at certain times contorting my body certain ways that the connection would drop off.  This may very well be the case with any bluetooth headphones, as this was my first attempt, but I really won't know until I try another brand.  However, the reason I'm giving 5 stars is because their customer service is first rate.  They tried to walk me through varies solutions for the problems I was having and when we couldn't make it work right, they took them back and even paid for the shipping!  I will say that for the price, the headphones sounded very good for both music and talking on the phone.  The bass is a little weak with heavy bass music, but that's to be expected for the price.  My situation my be a problem with application, not the headphones themselves, but if you're looking to try these, don't hesitate, there is really no risk to you at all.

Best of the 3 different brands I have owned


I have had 3 different pairs of bluetooth headphones over the years.  This pair is my favorite.  There is an off/on switch on the right ear bud, I can easily get to the port for charging, super simple to pair (even if I don't have instructions nearby), very very nice hard sided carrying case, an assundry of ear cushions, and two different cords for charging for android/pc/iphone.  Also tells me when the ear buds are charging and when they are fully charged.

Good value (that means they don’t cost a lot)


Good sound, seems to drown outside noise. Still working with ear tips to find a size that doesn’t fall out of my ear. This is a good value for what I’m getting, but I do not have a lot of control of the phone from your pieces, and they are a little bit prominent when they stick out of my ear. But for this price I can live with that.

Awesome volume!  Beats my old s10hd by a mile.  For a guy that hates ear buds (they fall out and I have odd shaped canal in one ear from operations) these are best I've found for the money and they stay in my ears.  Let's see how they put up with workouts but have ipx7 rated whatever that means.  The extra lightning/micro USB (in addition to standard micro USB cable) and car charger is a nice extra. Also comes with a nice little case and extra ear plugs of different sizes.

Sound is good but uncomfortable to wear.


The quality overall seems to be good. The sound quality is alright, and they have a good Bluetooth connection, but wearing them over your ears is very uncomfortable. I tried the different ear tips, but still it feels loose and like it's going to fall out of your ear. The hook doesn't seem to do anything since it doesn't really rest on your ear all that much, at least on my ears. I'm going to return it to Amazon and look for headphones with a different design.

Terrible Sound Quality


I've gone through a whole lot of headphones in my life, and for at least 10 years now, I have completely ignored any reviews that focus on sound quality. To my ears at least, all the earbuds I've ever owned have sounded more or less the same and until today, I had never found a pair of headphones that I couldn't listen to. I'm going to need to re-think this philosophy -- the noise coming out of my SENSO earbuds is so bad it's distracting. They're REALLY heavy on the bass, and not in a good way. I honestly had to stop listening to them and go back to my Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds after about 5 minutes.I was hoping these would be a good set of headphones to use when working out, but I'm clearly going to have to find something else.Pros:  - Comfortable to wearCons:  - Sound quality is atrocious  - Volume rocker feels very cheap

Random loud beeping, even when fully charged.


They beep ALL OF THE TIME. And it’s super loud in my ears.  Since I’ve gotten them this has been happening, I wrote in and never heard back.  Even when they are fully charged they will beep. I did read in the reviews that some people said this happened and I was naive enough to think I would get a pair that didn’t.  Don’t buy these, I’m sure there’s better blue tooth headphones out there.If you don’t mind random beeping the entire time you use them, yes the sound quality is good.

The buds were comfortable, easy to use, and exactly what i needed. but the battery went from holding a charge for 6-8 hours of use, to barely holding for an hour.

I've been using these for more than 3 years, and I haven't found a better pair! For the price you pay, it's a great deal. Great sound quality, pairs easily, good battery life and device lifetime. I'm actually going to buy another pair now, and decided to review them after having such good use over the last 3 years. One slight minus is that the chord is a little long and the right ear fitting doesn't seem to be as good as the left ear (but maybe that's because of my ear, and not the device?) .

I really like the Senso wireless headphones so far.  I have really small ears and at first the headphones seemed like they would not work for me but after putting on the 'small' plugs they seem to work good.  They work well in blocking out other sounds while listening to my music and have stayed in my ears during my workouts (and I do a lot of cardio and sweat quite a bit).

Good comfort. Terrible sound!


The bells and whistles on these headphones are nice. The feel is good, and it comes with an array of ear cushions for customization. However, the sound is terrible. Just terrible. Bass response is there, but the mids are muddy and the highs are non-existent. If you can't tell if one of your favorite songs sounds different when playing on a home stereo system vs through the speakers on your smart phone, then you probably won't notice the sound problem. For me, I was so distracted by how bad it sounded that I had to return them. Perhaps mine were faulty, but I didn't want to take another chance.

Decent cheap headphones, but they won’t last long


If you buy these, just realize that you are going to have to throw them away every six months. That has been my experience, they break after about half a year. Then you call the customer support line and do a factory reset, it doesn’t work, and they promise you they will get back to you. They never honor their warranty, they just keep promising they’ll get back to you. Very frustrating.I purchased these in May and they broke in November, have called customer support three times and they promised to honor the 1 year warranty. They have not.

Exceeding expectations - quality at a reasonable price


I was searching for a pair of headphones that I could use at the gym which would have a fairly decent sound quality but also a good microphone for taking calls. After doing a lot of research, the Senso headphones and their thousands of good reviews caught my attention and I said to give them a shoot. I was not disappointed at all: the quality of the materials is very good, the sound quality above expectations and so far the microphone does the job.Everything from the packing, to the extras in the box and the headphones themselves show a lot of care for the customer and attention towards a quality product! I can only join the other happy customers and totally recommend this product.

Once I FINALLY got the product to work, I was generally underwhelmed by the overall product - sound is OK but not great. The earbuds do not remain stable on your ears with any real movement - wire pulls them out of place, the location of the buttons is awkward and documentation is terrible!!!!Because they were under $35 I will keep them as a back-up but would not recommend them to anyone who plans to use them for exercise, even walking.

Impressive


I'm very impressed with these headphones.  Sound quality is excellent, with the foam tips I can just let them sit on top of my ear canal without inserting them and they sound decent.  If you insert them the sound quality and base improves.  They are very light and I can wear them for hours when they are sitting outside the canal and not really notice them.  What impressed me more was the microphone.  I can hold them away from me, whisper and they pick up the sound and send it through my phone to a call.  Sound quality is excellent, my other bluetooth headphones never had good pickup from the mic and the wife always complained she couldnt hear me when using them.  The Sensos are fantastic, no static and no dropped words.  My only complaint is the cord.  The way it comes in the package its all bent up and doesnt hang well.  I'd also prefer it went out the back instead of down in front of the ear.

Well made, great sound, fair price!


There are literally hundreds of choices in light weight blu-tooth headphones.  The Senso model is a good overall choice.  The sound is EXCELLENT and they pair up with both IPhone and Kindle quickly and easily.  My only complaint is that I cannot keep them in my ears when I bend down to do things.  This is especially annoying when walking our Chihuahuas.

Great ear buds, especially for the price


I’m on my second pair because my dog chewed up my first and I could not live without these things!!! The noise cancellation is pretty good for the price, though it’s certainly not like those headphones that block out everything. But the sound quality is amazing, and it comes with multiple bud sizes to fit your ear! These things do not fall out during a nice hard workout or even during a nap.Cannot recommend them enough for the price!!!

LOVE THESE!!!  After contemplating expensive name brand headphones I just couldn't bring myself to paying $150 plus!  I just happened to come across these on Amazon and they had a lot of positive feedback so, I decided to take a chance and I was not sorry! If you're looking for some inexpensive headphones that have quality sound, well look no further! I 100% recommend these! I love them!  If name brands is where its at for you then go pay your $150 plus.  As for me, these guys serve their purpose and then some!

Average sound, range, and battery life


The sound quality is average.  The battery life is average.  The range is maybe 25-30' if you walk directly out in front of your phone.  Turn a corner and you get maybe 15' from your phone and the reception starts breaking up.  I learned if I place my phone on top of 6' high lockers sort of in the middle of  my gym I can get a little better reception.  I replaced my old ones because they would not stay in my ears.  These do stay pretty well but average in all other areas.

Decent for the price.


I know I shouldn’t expect much for the price but the sound quality is mediocre. I think the frequency response of the speakers is a bit treble heavy and needs more low end before I touch my equalizer settings. Truthfully, I bought these as an interim pair of headphones until I can find a quality replacement that I’m willing to shell out more money for. I will give this product 3 stars though for being decent enough to work, even after the punishing amount of abuse I tend to unleash on sport headphones and other Bluetooth devices. They seem to be constructed well for the low price. Whether they survive being drowned in my sweat after dozens of spin classes will be the true test.

Good headphones, worth $20-36, not more than that


I see these headphones are currently ""marked down"" from $170 to $20. I paid $36 for them in May 2017. They're certainly not worth $170, though $20-36 is a good price.Pros:- I abused them pretty heavily and got 6 months of life out of them.- The sound is okay. Good bass. The highs are somewhat muted, and you will notice.- It doesn't throttle the volume much, so you can turn it UP. Be careful of your eardrums!- The BT can reach through 30-40' of open air. Through walls, it's worse. In my house, it barely makes it 8 feet through two walls.- My laptop doesn't have a BT transmitter, so I bought an adapter. These headphones were compatible with the adapter, no problem.- The ear loops hold onto the ears well.Cons:- The sound would scratch, kind of how a worn-out speaker sounds, but it'd stop after less than a minute and wouldn't do it again for a few days.- The controls are a little wonky. You can't mute it by holding the ""down volume"" button, you have to click it repeatedly.- In heavy winds, even wind generated by walking quickly, you'll hear a sound like wind whooshing through a cave.

Best ratio of price to quality Bluetooth headphones!


Best quality you can get for the price. Are there better headphones out there? Yes. Am I willing to pay 10 times the price for sound quality that is probably 5-10 percent better? No. If I was using headphones for some heavier duty stuff, then I'd probably sacrifice the money, but in my unprofessional opinion, there's no headphone out there with a better price to sound quality ratio. They don't stay in your ears perfectly while working out, but I also haven't really messed with the other buds to test if they fit my ears better. Like I said though, if I wanted to spend an extra 200 on headphones, they might hold a bit better, but I'm not about to review these THIRTY DOLLAR headphones against highly more expensive ones. I'd recommend a hundred times over to any average music listener looking for some wireless (except the wire that connects the two sides) headphones when you're not trying to break the bank.

Good headphones while they lasted...even better customer support!


I used these headphones when jogging 2-3 times per week for about 10 months and they worked great.  Then one day they just wouldn't turn on. I had a lot going on personally at the time and didn't get around to checking on the warranty until it was literally 363 days after I'd purchased them.  I emailed Senso to tell them the issue and got a pretty quick response back with a troubleshooting tip to try.  If that had worked, I would have been happy with that, but it didn't work for me, which I told them (through email) and they are sending me a new pair, no more questions. Totally standing by the one-year warranty.  If you're thinking about getting these, I would recommend it. Hopefully you won't have issues, but if you do (within one year) you have nothing to lose as the customer service is great!

No longer work well after just a few months of use.


Bought a pair for myself and my wife. Worked very well at first but they both started cycles of connecting / disconnecting. We both keep our phones on our person, depending on the way you move they will loose connection every few seconds. Sometimes if you power off / on it will work normally but it has become such a hassle they are now in the trash. Sad because I really liked them when I first started using them. Would not recommend them at all.

These wireless earbuds have been great since I purchased them a year ago


These wireless earbuds have been great since I purchased them a year ago. Customer service has been excellent also, when I lost a soft ear tip they sent out two new ones. Unfortunately at this time the left side has been inconsistent with connection. I've tried a factory reset and still having issue. It's been a little over a year and the warranty is now up. I don't think I'll purchase these again based on the fact that I don't want to pay full price with the possibility that this may reoccur. I've reached out to the manufacturer and they offered a 5% discount but that's not going to sway my decision to try a brand that carries a two year warranty. Hope this is helpful.

Invotek for the WIN!!!


I have tried a lot of headphones over the years (I am a musician/composer), and lately I've been searching for a blutooth set that will be durable, water resistant, and that will allow me to answer phone calls safely while driving. SENSO Activebuds do ALL of that. And aside from a slightly quiet mic, they EXCELL at battery life, water resistance, durability, and blutooth connection reliability. They stay in and on your ears, even if something tugs on them. They come with a car charger, extra cord, and foam ear pieces for ear protection/sound cancellation. They even come with a case to transport them. Out of over 6 dozen headphones used over my life, I am happiest with these. So stop reading this and buy these headphones before they sell out!#GEreviews on twitter.

Amazing Sound Quality and Battery Life


I purchased these in February of 2017 and I have been amazed by the sound quality since day 1. Amazing clarity, good bass, and high quality sound. The battery life is also worth bragging about. Each of my gym sesseion lasts about 2 hours, and sometimes I go 3 or 4 sessions without charging it and they have only died on me once (my own damn fault). Just this month, a year and 10 months later, one of the earpieces started going in and out. I have put these things through the ringer and they have taken liters of my sweat and worked great for almost 2 years. I am writing this review now since I was so pleased that I am purchasing another pair. At this price point, there is no comparison. These things are AMAZING!!!

The Amazon vendor was outstanding. I callled about an issue fully expecting to get the run around, assuming I would be able to get any response. Are you kidding me? Not only did I get a live person, but that person was extremely helpful. In just a few minutes, we determined what was needed and a very satisfactory solution was aschieved. WOW!

These headphones sound really good. The bass is just right, I can hear instruments I never noticed in songs. I wear them at night to listen to rainstorms to help me sleep and in the evenings to dance around (my new form of exercise). I highly recommend these to those who do not have hundred to spend on quality wireless headphones. I am still experimenting with the extra ear sizes but that does not detract from the sound from this set of headphones. You should not be disappointed.

Not for athletes.


Nice packaging, numerous rubber and foam bud replacements. Good customer service as they contacted me a week after receiving my product. However, these simply do not stay put while actively working out. I didn't pay for customer service, I paid for good working 'athletes' headphones. Barely a month in and these now randomly connect/ disconnect and call my last number dialed whenever they want. Wish I had returned the but I missed the window while on vacation. Absolute waste.

What do you expect from cheap garbage from Amazon?  Well I go news for you, you get what you pay for.  Yes, this junk will stay on your ear.  Big deal, they have a bendable ear clip which I guarantee will break in 30 days.  So the good point is they stay on your ear, the bad news is that the sound is as horrible as you’d expect from such cheap junk.

I bought these ""by mistake"", as my 15 year old son had showed me a pair of ""the other brand"" and I forgot to save it, I thought these were the one's he wanted and the reviews were outstanding so I hit the magic button.  He was worried when I showed him which one's I had coming, as he had his heart set on the other one's.  He's only had them for 2 days now, and is giving a tremendous review for these buds!  (Whew! Yay Mom!)  He is a huge gamer and listens to music pretty much all day and say's that when a really good song comes on, he'll just ""tap my ear and the bass absolutely thumps!""  The charging is fast, the need to charge is seldom, they're comfortable, the carrying case is cool, easy to figure out... these are a BIG win in his opinion!  As his mother, let's not forget that price!!  Definitely recommended!!

Best ever


I have a love hate relationship with headphones. I’m a long distance runner and love listening to Audible while running. Headphones don’t fit in my ears, and despite minimal wear and tear, fall apart too fast. I have had these for over half a year. They have been great. I’ve also had business calls while on my runs, and the clarity and ease of use is perfect. THEN, my button got jammed. I don’t know why. It was fine one day and not fine the next. I contacted Senso through their website figuring I’d get some lame response a week later. Instead, they got back to me within the hour with a really well written email asking for my Amazon order number. They confirmed my address and have a new pair on the way to me since it’s under warranty. This has to be one of the best customer service I have ever received. I will be a Senso headphone wearer for life.

I was a bit surprised when I first used them. 20$ how good could they really be. Well the 30k ppl are right. They Rock!!! Great sound all around. The ONLY thing I didnt like was the case that it comes with. I can see how ppl break the buds. It's to tight in the case for the buds. I recommend using the box it comes in. The box is way better fit, harder, more room if you'd like to take a few extra items with them. All around I love these buds. I would 100% buy them again.

Best Purchase Yet


UPDATE: 10/25/17: Headphone on button stopped working completely entire outside case broke apart. I haven’t even had these for a year and they broke down on me. Very disappointed. UPDATE (8/17/17): I had to drop two stars down. Unfortunately it seems over time the battery life decreases. Additionally the battery life reader won't accurately calculate the remaining life span. The other issue I have found over time is that when you charge, the blue light won't come back on when it is fully charged so I have to guess when it's had enough time. This was my second pair purchased. Cannot stress how amazing these are! I purchase a lot on Amazon, but only really write reviews for products I believe are worth the time! The battery life on these still blows me away. I use them all day during work. The package they come with alone is worthwhile. These are so great I'm purchasing a second pair for my mom. If your looking for affordable Bluetooth headphones, that have a durable battery life and have the most bang for you buck. These are definitely it!

So-so sound quality, really so-so. Marginal value.


Better than average sound quantity for a Bluetooth set but subpar to most wired sets. The sound is too soft and muted. Good set for an occasional use at the gym where the quantity doesn't count - only convenience.Just to add a bit more. The louder the sound the more distorted it gets.Not sure where all the 5 star reviews are from. If this is 5 then it's out of 20.Sorry guys but you need to work on the sound quality.

Okay as workout headphones, poor for anything else.


The good:  Sound quality is fine (not great) when used as headphones.  It's comes with a dual USB Car charger and many accessories.  The battery seems to work as they describe.The bad:  Very uncomfortable with how they fit in the ear and the over the ear part doesn't have any functionality at all.  Also they look and feel very cheap.The ugly:  When I use these as a headset for my phone (my primary intended use) everyone I speak with say that they can hear an echo, especially when they are also on a headset.

I always appreciate it when product manufacturers think outside the box (and then put it IN the box).  The headphones work great (took them out on a 10k run and they performed perfectly).They arrive well packaged with a great combo micro USB/Lightning cable and plenty of ear top options.

These earphones are a great price and great quality!  They come with multiple attachments and are adjustable, so they will fit no matter what size your ears are!  Moreover, they do a great job of blocking outside noise- I used to have to turn the volume of my apple earphones up all the way to block out other noises, but with these I don't even have to turn the volume up to the halfway point!  I wear them at the gym at least 4 times a week, and they are great for running, lifting, and any other workout.  They will even tell you when the battery is low!  Overall, these are a great buy!

I will say the Headphones were easy to pair with the watch. The sound was crystal clear! The only suggestion that i might make is a tune up in the bass output. I am familiar with some wireless buds that command a higher price. Honestly, at a moderate price, the Senso headphones are a much better value. I plan to purchase more as gifts.

Senso Sport wireless mini headphones an awesome choice !


So far so good excellent sound and connectivity to blue tooth was smooth. Still early just had them for a week bought two pair one for my teenage daughter, so will see what she thinks as teenagers will take them to task 🎼. The only thing at the moment would be cosmetic that the ear piece rap around were interchangeable from flex, flex medium or flex firm. They are very gummy for lack of description but do contour to your ear. Just hope they don't eventually tear off after the one year factory warranty.  price drop to 25.00 during ciber Monday shortly after I purchased for 33 bucks still a good price given the quality engineering and sound. You go Senso!

Incredible buds for the money


I am a bit of a headphone snob, find the tinny cheap headphones to be irritating and unusable. Thus these Senso's exceeded my wildest expectations in terms of the sound quality.Been testing them  out on various Spotify playlists like ""songs to test your headphones"" and these are right up there with my audiotechnia cans. And much lighter, portable, and feel very comfortable for long periods on my ears.  I don't  get much noise cancelling, at least not for ambient street noise,do have to stop them or remove to have a conversation. Great for walking jogging exercise etc. .

Sound is good but distance is horrible..... definitely not 30ft. I have my phone in my pocket and it cuts off all the time.... if I could return these i would.... i figure I would test them out thoroughly and it would cut here and there but now its just annoying.

Fall out of my ears


These work. The battery doesn't last surprisingly short or long. The connection is lost if you walk down a long hallway, but stays connected in a somewhat large room. The only real complaint is that they don't stay in my ears very well even with the little arm that goes behind my ear. The arm is too large and doesn't actively rest on my ear but it is there if they fall out. When I run or doing intense activity where I sweat, they twist forward in my ear and eventually fall out.

Great earbuds!! 100% worth the money and VERY reliable.


Okay so I'm sparse with glowing reviews. But these earbuds have far exceeded my expectations. I have now purchased 4 pairs in all. A pair for myself, wife, 2 kids...we use them working out I use them when my high dollar name brand earbuds dead after 20 min. These are my reliable, sweat proof, hard to break and comfy go to. If your wondering how well they are made that's it. 100% won't let you down. I wear mine in the shower listening to motivational videos even.

Earphone broke shortly. It was not working very well ...


Earphone broke shortly.It was not working very well when I received it, it can only receive signal within a very close distance, a lot less than the number states in the listing, but I was okay with it since I alway carry the cellphone with me. But one day, after it turning off automatically, I'm not able to charge the earphone or pair it with devices anymore. Tried all means, but still not working. Contacted the seller since it is still within 1yr warranty, and was promised a replacement will be sent. However, more than two weeks had passed, and I didn't receive anything, not even a word explaining whats going on.

Inexpensive and still not worth it


I really wanted to love these headphones, but I can not. I have ordered two pair's of these headphones . The first pair, the sound quality was so poor that I had to send them back, and the second pair had the same issue. In the beginning, these headphones seemed like a good idea because they are wireless, but I traded these in for Apple airpods which are expensive, but definitely worth the money.So, if sound quality is important to you, do not buy these.

Sound great


So far so good. Sounds great. fit good. Connected easy. Doesnt seem to work with voice activation unless im doing something wrong. I dont use it anyways. Biggest complaint is cord catches when i turn my head left to right, have to lift cord and adjust what seems like a lot. Maybe a longer cord or mesh material that doesnt stick?  Bonus comes with cool dual cord for itrash phone and micro usb combo. 2 cords in paxkage and car charger  w/case and multiple ear bud styles.

HOLY SSHHHHMy Bose headphones broke after only a year and 10 days. (10 days out of the warranty...go figure right.) I'm on a budget right now so I decided to get these. They are way louder than the Bose and really are noise canceling, they like suction in my little ear holes hahahaI HIGHLY recommend these, the bass is awesome. I'm a hip hop head so it's perfect for me. Spring for the warranty, it's only a little extra and gives you some peace of mind.

Very good headphones


These have performed very well for me.  I primarily use them to connect to my iPhone 6S and listen to podcasts while I'm exercising.  The ear cushions are comfortable, though they do tend to slip out when I start getting sweaty, but the ear loops keep them from falling.Regarding sound quality, they are perfectly fine for podcasts.  When I try to listen to music, I find the sound weighted too heavily to the bass end, but it's acceptable

Worth it


For my first pair of bluetooth wireless headphones, I don't have any complaints. They stay connected as well as connect easily once your phone's bluetooth is on. The volume is nice and clear and they stay in your ear unless you are beyond sweaty which may be TMI but it happens when you work out.BTW they come with a charger that has a head for both apple and android & it both looks really cool and charges fast. Definitely worth the money.I will say that it has been an adjustment getting used to the buttons and over ear piece, I constantly find myself touching my ear to make sure the over ear piece is in place and i end up pausing my music. But that is my personal struggle, nothing against the headphones them self.

Decent with a few disappointments


Overall, I was looking for a decent set of bluetooth headphones that would stay in my ears while running and doing activities. I learned that the hooks over the ears are super flimsy and almost pointless. They don't help much for keeping the headphones in my ears - I have to wear a hat with them in order to keep them on.Bluetooth distance - up close with your phone, the connection is great but when I get about 10 feet away, things start to break up a bit.For the sound, it's not bad. My big gripe here is that when I'm doing an activity with a lot of background noise (mowing the lawn), the volume doesn't go high enough. I can barely hear anything.These headphones are ok for now but I'll likely be getting some different ones in the near future.

Love these. I've had them for over a year and they're still going strong. They put out pretty good sound quality for a low price. Perfect for using at the gym. Easily could get a 5+ hour battery life from one charge. Definitely hold on to the spare ear prices, they get kinda gross after awhile.

They are fantastic! Great sounds


They are fantastic!  Great sounds, lightweight, great battery life.  I was using them for close to 8 hours, and I still have over 50% battery.  Battery life is displayed on the phone next to the bluetooth symbol.  For some reason, the makers of this product decided to throw in a phone magnet for your car, and a phone wallet thing.  It also came with a bunch of different size ear pieces and a carrying case.  Very nice of them to include all of these accessories.  The magnetic phone holder for the car works really well.  I am very pleased with that as well.  The only small complaint I have is this: upon receiving the headphones, one of the ear holders was slightly bent, and it was not fitting on my ear correctly.  This is slowly correcting itself and I'm sure it'll be fine in a week or two.

Great value


For the price, these are a great value.  I bought them for use in then gym or when I listening to music without a cord.  Don't expect world-beating sound, but it's pretty good.  Setup/connection is easy, fit is good, controls are also easy to use, and the included car charger with android and apple connectors is a nice touch.  Clarity on phone calls not the best when there is background noise - at least that's what people on the other end of the line said.  I'd buy them again.  If fact I did already after losing the first pair I bought. Customer service is excellent.  Had an issue with them holding a charge, but a very short phone call had a new pair on the way at no cost.  Could not have been easier.

Good value, but battery life not as long as advertised


I've been looking for a good, but inexpensive set of Bluetooth headphones.  And frankly, I didn't do a lot of research before I bought these.  In fact, I was sitting in a local bar, drinking a beer and looking at wireless headphones on my phone's Amazon app.  But the Senso headphones seemed to be a good bargain at less than $40, so what the heck, I ordered them.  I've used them for about week now and I have mostly good things to say about them.  First, of course, is the price.  That's a positive.  Next, they are reasonably comfortable when being worn.  They come with three sets of ear plugs, so you can probably find a size that will allow them to remain in your ear canal.  Having the part that fits over your ear is also nice, as that piece holds the headphones fairly stable.You also get some very nice accessories along with the product.  Two charging cables, a car charger with two charging ports and a very nice case for the device.I also must say that the sound quality of these headphones is excellent and loud.  Music that sounded tinny coming from my wired earphones sounded much richer out of the Senso.  Also, they are much louder.  When mowing the yard and listening to music or talk radio, I had to turn the volume on the phone completely up to hear over the drone of the mower motor.  Now, with the Senso, I have to reduce the volume.The reason I deducted one star from my review is that the battery life isn't nearly 8 hours, as advertised by the company.  I estimate I got 4 1/2 to 5 hours on a charge.  Not too bad, I suppose, but as I've never owned a set of these before, I have no other product to compare it with. Still, the headphones charge quickly, but if you're like me and use them at a gym, I'd recommend being diligent in charging them or carrying a good old-fashioned pair of wired earphones with you as a backup in case the Senso goes out on you.  But, all in all, I'd buy this product again.

Amazing product and amazing price!  I like to run outside, and I've owned several wireless and wired headphones over the years.  These headphones are by far the best headphones I've ever bought.  The sound is better than some very expensive Sennheiser ear buds that I purchased a few years ago.  To make it even better the carrying case includes a car charger and a lightning plug.  For the money, these Bluetooth headphones and the additional stuff that comes with it can't be beat.  In fact, I liked them so much that I bought a second pair.

Discomfort + wind while running


10k+ reviews sold it for me and I decided to give these a try. For the price you're paying, most of it is going towards the accessories. I don't need a car charger or an extra usb cable, that's not what I am here to buy. These earbuds are weirdly shaped that they cause me discomfort. I don't know if my ear is weird or what, but I can't wear them for more than 15 mins without feeling pain. Not to mention the running + wind howling. I'll be returning these.

Listening, Yes. Calling, No.


Works well if just listening to music or whatever. If I use it for calls it is crackly, and sometimes gets crazy ""outer space"" interference sounding noises. This is when both phone and headphones are fully charged. People I am talking to complain it picks up too much ambient noise or noise around me.

Not secure on ears


I found the sound to be quite good however they did not set securely in my ears and would likely fall out if bumped ever so slightly.  The soft piece that wraps around the top of the ear is very flimsy (comfortable) but did not in my experience offer much additional securement.  The soft ear bud tips would not insert far enough into my ears due to the design of the headset.  I will continue to use my 4 year old Motorolas until I can find a better replacement.

A good Bluetooth earphones at a good price.


The Bluetooth is very quick at connecting with my iPhone, ipads, and the sound is very good and clear both at listening music and talk on the phone.  It's no difference than listening with the apple wired earpods.  I can't compare with the apple Bluetooth earphones because I don't have one and no plan to spend big buck for one.  I'd rather save the money for the real Bluetooth headphones like Bose or Bowers & Wilkins, etc. if I am really into music.Also, this earphones does fit in the ears good and stable.

I was somewhat skeptical about ordering a $20 pair of headphones, however upon opening the package and listening to them, I'm convinced that they are more than worth the price of admission.

The packaging was very nice and the carrying case was more than I expected for the price.

Not good for sports.


I bought these for running and working out. When you sweat the cord sticks to your neck and pulls the ear buds loose from your ears. I'm a big guy and the over ear part is too big. I can put my finger on top of my ear between the headphone hoop they are so big. If this was smaller I don't think the cord would be a problem. Also I think if the cord went over the ear it would be better. By pulling down it pulls the ear buds loose.

Great Sound, Comfortable fit, Great Accessories, Great Product


I purchased these headphones because I listening to music all day at work and I wanted something that was comfortable to wear that I wasn't tethered to my laptop.  I also needed to use them for phone calls since our phone calls are received through our laptops.  I had an over the ear headset that was provided to me that were uncomfortable when worn for 7+ hours.  I have to say that when I received them I was amazed at the additional accessories that came with them.  A car charger, A 3ft. cable that has is capable of not only charging my Samsung Galaxy 7 phone but has an adapter to charge my wife's IPhone 7 which is attached to the cable so it won't get lost, and a nice carrying case.  The 3ft. cable alone is worth the purchase, which I put in our most used vehicle so we don't have to carry multiple cables anymore.  These are super comfortable, the ear pieces themselves that wrap around my ear are rubber (not plastic) and I barely notice them.  The ear buds fit snuggly in my ear without giving me any discomfort.  The battery life is great I used them my entire work day and then charged them overnight.  The sound from them when I pair them to my phone or smart watch is awesome and the range is great.  I can walk to the water fountain at work which is down the hall and still listen to my music or answer calls when they are attached to my laptop.

A voice tells you when they are connected and disconnected; a really nice feature that was a beef with my prior headphones.  The description on Amazon doesn't say that they come with a really nice small hard shell case that keeps your charging cord, extra buds, and the headphones themselves safe, which fits perfectly in a pocket of a gym bag.

They don't distort even with the bass louder. This are my first bluetooth earbuds so I'm not sure how the others compare except that these seem to be a little cheaper than some.Durability is key for me - I've had to replace so many earbud/earphones/cords, etc. I just had to try bluetooth.I write back to report on them after a period of time using them.

My Bluetooth on both iPhone and iPad is showing senso s250 when I press connect, it gives me the message that the pairing was unsuccessful. I have tried rebooting both my phone and charged the earbuds the entire night to make sure they are fully charged.

I've had them for a while now and have tried using them in several locations and situations. As headphones they're great but the microphone is pretty much useless in a noisy environment, which is why I bought them. I work in various data centers with computer background noise, and conversations are pointless. I can hear my caller just fine but I end up disconnecting the unit out of frustration with customers and contacts. So they're collecting dust right now.

Not for Running


Bought these for my runs. They initially sounded great; very loud with a great EQ mix. Unfortunately, the started having problems on my first run with them. Firstly, they don't stay in the ear. I had to adjust them a few times a minute, which is annoying. Then, after about an hour of use, they started cutting out (sound would waver in and out). Additionally, after further use, the right headphone began to lose volume when compared to the left. I think the sweat played a role in this, which is lame because they claim to be waterproof. After a couple more days, the on/off button became permanently pushed in, so it's very difficult to even turn them on now. Wouldn't recommend for running/exercising/sweating in. Might be a good choice for daily use at home or in an office setting.

The Senso version seems as if it comes from the same basic design as others you can find but the sound quality has less bass (or more highs) depending on your perspective. The extra ""goodies"" are an added touch over the competition. The lady with the English accent tells me when it turns on and off and the battery level is low.

Affordable and good quality running earphone


The earphone came with a lot of accessories; silicone ear tips for all size and a comfortable foam tip. Good sound quality for its price range. Good and fast connection with my iPhone and battery lasted pretty long.  Only thing I didn’t like is the plastic behind the ear tips are a bit hard and could be uncomfortable.  Overall, great product for its price and would recommend it to anyone that need an affordable earphone.

Sensor quality went to crap


2nd set I bought. 1st pair lasted two years. This set didn’t even last two weeks.Just completely poor quality. The speaker part would always separate from rest of housing so rubber ear piece is just dangling.The stupid flexible ear supports are trash. They have no strength to maintain the shape of your ear so are easily pulled off and aren’t durible at all.I just bought a different, cheaper costing pair that had same or better reviews.

I ordered these because of the high number of reviews.  Everything was well packaged but the red foam ear plug was deformed from being compressed in the package.  I couldn't get the ear piece to fit correctly in my ear.  The package does come with 3 sets of plastic adaptors but I prefer the foam for tight fit.  They sound great and hopefully the mfg will send me out a new set of foam plugs.

Great Value Gym Headphones


First off, they are $30 headphones, so if you expect them to sound like $200 Bose, you will be disappointed. However, if you keep an open mind to the fact that they are $30 headphones, you will be happy. Sure, the sound quality is not the same as Bose or Sony or anything, but sound quality was not the reason I bought these headphones, I bought them strictly to have no cords attached when at the gym. I workout everyday for 60 minutes and only have to charge them on Sunday, so the battery definitely last 5-6 hours. Other people have written about having trouble keeping the headphones in when they are sweaty, I do not have this problem. I do a 20 minute run and pour sweat, and they work perfectly, they do not fall out of my ears nor do they short out or anything like that. The headphones come with a nice hardbody case which is a nice little bonus. Overall, no complaints with these headphones whatsoever, they do exactly what I want them to do, especially for $30. If you simply want bluetooth headphones for the gym, I think these will certainly do the trick.

Great pair of bluetooth earbuds/Headphones


I received my product recently but I have to say it works great and I like the look of them! It feels like nothing when you wear it which is really good for exercising or any other activity! I haven't found any problems with them falling off my ears even with a lot of shaking. Now the sound is pretty decent for the price, it focuses more in mid-lows (Which I actually like in many songs I listen to) but it doesn't lose on the highs especially if you crank up the volume. I haven't found any significant distortion even with some really bassy songs, it will have some if you max the volume in specific songs but it kinda hurts the ear so you don't need to. Lastly, I really like the carrying case and the extra USB to microUSB with a lightning port adapter, pretty neat addition!The only thing that needs a bit more work to make it perfect is a bit of balancing with the mid-lows and highs (which you can adjust on your own device but some people want it ready and perfect) otherwise I totally recommend it!!!

Best ones yet!


I love wireless headphones but the ones I tried either fell off easily or the battery life was too short. Also one only connected with Chinese commands. I tried some sports buds but fell off when I did even minor exercises. Then I found SENSO ActiBuds and found that they were everything they say. They stay on your ears, get as loud as you want, and the battery life last all day or night of continuous use.  They quickly re-charge in a few hours. I am so happy with them I am ordering another pair for my wife!

Good Running Bluetooth Headphones


Not bad earbuds for the price that I paid ($30). They do have good sound but sometimes the bass gets a little muddled. As in when listening to rap or dubstep or EDM or anything with deep bass, the earbuds kinda muddle the bass to where the rest of the sound isn't that clear. But what I can't figure why this only happens sometimes. Sometimes I use them and the bass is fine, no muddling at all, it sounds perfectly clear. So they aren't super consistent in that regard, but everything else such as acoustic music or music that emphasizes vocals like Sia's Chandelier they work perfectly. Battery life is pretty decent, i get about 8-10 hours most of the time. And for those curious people I'm using them with an iPhone 6s Plus. As far as exercise they are very secure as in they don't fall out, and previously i've just been using apple earpods. So I do like them alot but would they be worth the MSRP of $180? Absolutely not. Worth $30? Yeah I think so, although I would not have paid more than $40 for them. Overall not bad, just the inconsistent bass bugs me, but other than that no problems.

Nice, but Bluetooth is faulty


Sound is good, fit not bad, extras included.  But, Bluetooth connectivity is very bad.  Put a cell phone in back pocket of pants and the signal is distorted with every step.Also, these ear buds need line of sight to source.  Even putting a hand between source and right sight ear bud the bluetooth sounds is distorted or connection is lost.Yes, I've tried the reset process.  Did not help.  Sounds like an antenna issue?  Anyway, returning them.

No wind reduction/ poor sound quality


These are for sure the worst headphones I’ve ever tried. I am a long distance runner and not only do the earbuds pop out every few minutes they are very heavy and bulky over the course of a long run. I tried some of the recommended things other reviewers have posted here to see if I could somehow get these to work for me but they are going back. There is no wind reduction with these. The overall sound is heavy muddy bass with a small trace of upper range. The only thing I liked about these was the easy and reliable Bluetooth paring with my I phone. I am going back to my trusted  Rovkings.

Well loved, then BROKE after 11 months of use and Senso refused to help! Very disappointing.


I loved these headphones and wanted so much to love this company, too! Talking quality for phone calls wasn’t great, but worked like a dream for listening to music. Imagine my disappointment when theu started having a crackly static that showed up every time I used them!! I contacted Senso with hopes they would provide support, and customer service was very responsive with troubleshooting until they determined the problem was actually with the headphones, not with my use of them. Immediately, the customer service department “mysteriously” stopped all communication with me, and refused to provide any offer of repair or replacement—or even a discount for future use! I am so disappointed.

Highly recommend!


These headphones are pretty amazing! At first I was apprehensive to buy them, but I am very glad I did! My boyfriend bought a pair a few months back and uses them on the daily so I decided to invest in a pair. I have had them for about a month and the sound quality is great I normally have to keep them on the lower volume setting because they work so well. The battery does not last 8 hours like some people said, however, I use mine for at least 5 hours of constant use before charging them. They take about 1-2 hours to charge. Calls work well too. I would say they work until you are around 50ft away. Also comes with a charger for Apple and Samsung phones and a car adapter. Well worth it for the price!!

Starts out great | Warranty is bullshit


I purchased this product back in August, 2017. They've were great for about a month and randomly started having problems maintaining connection with my phone while playing music. It wouldn't disconnect from bluetooth, but I would get consistent skipping and connection ""buffering"" while walking downtown Chicago as well as in the burbs. I ignored this  awesome new feature as I figured out how to stabilize the connection by placing my phone in a different pocket. No biggie, right? 3 more months go by in this manner. A week ago, the left earbud stopped working entirely.I immediately remembered this product had a year long warranty and reached out to the company to see what they could do for me.....Still no response.

Work well, clear sound, rugged, terrific battery life. Great value as the item includes a car charger, combo Lightning/mini USB cable, and multiple ear tips. The actual ear pieces are not the most aesthetic or light but cannot complain at this price point. The sound is decent to hear regular audio but certainly not anywhere near an audiophile standard. However, for the casual user, I would highly recommend these bluetooth headphones!

These are great headphones. Battery lasts a long time and the sound quality is great. My favorite thing, however, about having bought these earphones is the wonderful customer service I received. My headphones recently stopped working very suddenly. One night they worked great. I plugged them in and the next day they wouldn't power on. I contacted the company. They gave me some troubleshooting tips, which I tried. When those didn't work I contacted them again and without any further questions they mailed me a new pair! They just needed my order #. It was so effortless and they stand behind their products and that 1 year warranty. Very pleased.

These headphones were quite a surprise when they arrived. They came with several charging cables, a car adapter, a zip up case, various rubber buds, far more than I expected! So far I have used them extensively while running and working out and they don't cut out at all. The sound quality is a little less than my EarPods but that's nothing I have a problem with. I have yet to test the water resistant feature since it's IPX7 but time will tell of these were a great deal or temporary pleasure.

Good product, but if they break good luck trying to get them to replace them for you.


When I had them they were good. But they broke after like a month. You can shower with them which is nice and the battery life and the sound quality are both really good. Especially for the price. However, this 1 star review comes because even though I purchased a 3 year warranty on them neither the company or Amazon will give me a replacement for my broken ones.I shouldn't have to be out $30+ (they were more expensive when I bought them compared to what they are now) because they don't want to honor the agreement I paid for. If this wasn't an issue this would be at least 4 stars for the time I had them. But with all the problems I've been having trying to either get my money back or a new replacement pair, 1 star.

Excellent package, excellent phones


The phones arrived quickly and well packaged in a smart box that also provided a clear guide to the contents.The actual package was very comprehensive with not only short and a long charging leads, but a dual car lighter adaptor and a smart carrying case to protect the phones.The phones themselves are compact and light, fitting comfortably and snugly (with small, medium and large ear buds) all waterproof, making them ideal for exercise use. The sound from such light and compact phones is excellent, with good ambient noise suppression. I have listened to audio books and music, both of which are reproduced very clearly and at more than adequate volume from my phone.Overall I very pleased with the purchase and with the very reasonable price.

Fine for gym, terrible for running or outdoor use


I was looking for a good pair of wireless headphones for running, and I liked the over-the-ear loop on these, which helps keep them secure.  The carrying case is also a handy place to store the headphones.  Unfortunately, I found out that these are also somewhat bulkier than they look.  The part that each ear bud is attached to is a fairly large rectangle that houses the battery.  It sticks out further than you would think, and I found that it creates distracting wind noise simply from running.  The airflow seems to catch on the rectangles with the Senso logo and the noise then goes into your ear.  If there is also any actual wind, the headphones are  pretty close to unusable.  This would be fine for gym workouts or just listening to music, but they are not good for running.

Sound is mediocre (updated: can sound decent). Price and ease of use is great.


They are a lot more ""boomy"" (not in a  good way) than I expected. The highs seem to not be present. They fit great and using them is easy. I just crave a lot more definition from the top end of the spectrum and less mid-range distortion and bass boom.Up to 5 stars: See updated comment... the trick for me was to not press the headphones in too tightly into the ear. I still have to experiment with other size plugs that it came with.

I was looking forward to using those, based on reviews. The sound is truly amazing, better than my Beats 3. Sadly I encountered a few problems in the first 5 min. 1- The bluetooth connectivity disconnected & the music blared from my iPhone 7. 2- The main part of the ear piece (black/red) is so heavy it kept falling out. 3- The over-the-ear part is super soft & as light as a rubber band, therefore not helping with the second issue :(

Don't spend 120$ on headphones! Buy these


They are a good bargain. Purchasing these I was not worried so much about sound quality as durability and ergonomics. They stay in my ear while I run and workout without having to readjust even when I get all sweaty. They are extremely easy to use and pairing them with my Android phone was a breeze. The sound quality seems good to me. I listen to rock music during workouts. I'm not musically experienced enough to recognize what the limitations are on them or what they lack as far as that goes but I had another brand that were over 120$ and I don't think I could tell the difference between the two. I haven't had any problems with range or interference either. I can get about 45' away from my phone and they still work well. They come in a cool carrying case with a nifty charger. I would have given them 5 stars but Im stingy with my stars and haven't had the headphones long enough to really see if they have the durability to last and deserve the 5th.

Depends on your use


These headphones are hit and a miss. No matter what, they hold a great long charge of at least 10 hours. The sound is better than most and they are fairly comfortable. The thing that fails me every time is the signal and feed. It is not an issue with my phone. If the phone is in a backpack or one of my backpockets then I have a broken signal to the headphones and it skips. If the phone has a direct line of sight then it's usually fine. As far as working out with them, I'd recommend them if you have the ability to leave your phone out on a table near you. For the type of use I wanted out of them, they suck.

These headphones are not worth your money.


This product is defective and has a persistent buzzing sound in the earbuds. I tried to reach out three times, two by email with no response, and once from Invotek customer service. They recommended a factory reset, but that did not work, or a replacement for the same product. I recommend going through Amazon instead of Invotek for a replacement. This was the second set of headphones I purchased through Amazon and the same problem persisted. There is a constant buzzing in the left earphone that makes listening to anything unbearable. Factory reset did not resolve the issue. I prefer to put my money elsewhere to buy a higher quality product to avoid this issue. I want to be clear that I got great customer service from Amazon but inadequate customer service from Invotek.

Good headset but lots of wind noise on bikes


There are lots of things that I like about this headset:  they are comfortable and the over the ear loops keep the buds snug in my ears even on a bike.  The sound is also very good when I'm working out in the gym.  The issue is that the way the units are designed, I get excessive wind noise on my bike, which greatly reduces the listening experience.  I may try to block the airflow with some tape or something, but I would not recommend buying this headset if you plan to use it primarily for bike riding.

So I am disappointed with them at $36


Now, I only paid $36 for these- reduced from $169!So I am disappointed with them at $36, imagine if you paid full price!What is wrong, well;-they do not stay in once you get really sweaty-the loops are flimsy and do not really secure the phones-the buds create an air tight seal when fitted properly - to aid noise suppression I guess - but this means that it feels like you are under water, plus you hear every footfall when running inside your head - like a dull thud.-So no good for running - which is how they are sold- but would be good on aircraft etc I guess.Not tried the microphone so cannot comment on this part.Back to the drawing board

The quality of sound is great!  They are easy to use and connect to the iPhone.  I wish I could adjust the volume lower.  I have my phone volume on low (per instructions) and the headphones on the lowest setting, but they are still a little loud.  Probably not a problem for most people, I just like to keep the volume low.  I have not used them with a phone call yet, so I can't not speak to how well this function works.

and he liked them so much


I don't normally write reviews for products, but my experience was so positive, I thought I'd share. My brother bought a pair of these, and he liked them so much, that I decided to get a pair too. I get annoyed with the ear wrap-arounds on this style of headphone, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that they are extremely comfortable, and I didn't notice them at all. I also was worried about the microphone because I make calls using my headphones quite frequently. The microphone is built into the ear piece, so I thought it wouldn't work that well. However, again, I was shocked to find that my voice came through crystal clear. My absolute favorite feature though would have to be the noise-cancelling ability. They aren't advertised as such, but these headphones do a fantastic job blocking out sound, almost too good of a job. I literally have to take them out when people are talking to me or I can't hear them. The sound quality is also great. One last thing to note, I'd advise to be cautious purchasing for children because these headphones can get really loud. Overall, FANTASTIC BUY for the price. Intuitive earbud controls, easy blue-tooth pairing, and great overall sound quality. I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

One thing to watch out for is that these are not really shaped aerodynamically - so if you run with them you will hear the air hitting it. Even if you're just walking and there is a breeze, you will hear the wind.That's the only issue I have with these. Everything else I like. These are sturdy, durable, long battery life, light-weight, reasonably comfortable and they never fall out of my ears. The sound quality is also great.

Meh...everything is just - ok. The buds don't fit in my ears well, even with the smallest inserts. The part that goes over the ear doesn't do much to keep the headphones in place either.

I can hear a lot of background noise with these on but this may be related to the fit. The battery life is pretty good though.

I'm taking that as a good sign!


I purchased these headphones to use with my ipod nano (7th gen). I've never used wireless headphones before and I must say that I'm a fan! I was very impressed with the accessories that came with them, as well as a one year warranty if you registered them. Unfortunately,I had to use the warranty after about 4 uses. After I initially connected them, I experienced a lot of crackling, especially if I turned my head. It was ok though, because I used them for running and I don't have to turn my head very often. In mid run last week, I adjusted the right earphone (the one that has the controls) and I accidentally turned them off. I was unable to turn them back on after that. When I got home, I sent an email to customer service and they immediately responded. They were very apologetic and offered some instructions on how to do a hard reset. I tried it, but sadly, it didn't work. Long story short, I believe the pair that got was just part of the 1% that got through their testing department. Customer service sent me another pair within a week. I used them yesterday, and had no crackling whatsoever. I'm taking that as a good sign!

I have recommended this product to my friends and family


The best review I can give this product is to recommend it to friends and family. After owning the earbuds for two weeks I bought a pair for my sister and father. I have recommended it to all my friends and acquaintances, many of whom now happily own the product. The best aspects of the product are as follows:Sound quality is above that of other work out head phones I've triedFits snugly on the ear so that you can run with them, yet comfortableNoise cancelling, such that I can hear my music on a loud plane without turning the volume all the way upLong lasting battery lifeConnects immediately to my devices when I power on, remembers the last two devices usedAnd besides all this, the customer service from Senso has been exceptional. Email correspondence is quick, and they seem to care deeply about my satisfaction with the product.

I'm very happy with these headphones


I'm very happy with these headphones.  They came nicely packaged, with a carrying case, 3 different sizes of earbuds, charging cords (even a car charger!), and really nice instructions, laminated and easy to read and understand. I specifically chose them because I haven't been able to find any that are comfortable and stay in my ears.  These do!  And the fact that the controls aren't hanging on the connecting wire makes a big difference.  They stay in place.  The sound quality is fine, also.

Great headphones, great sound, great battery!


Great headphones! In fact, this is the second time I've purchased them as I lost the previous pair. I use them for running and they are perfect! They stay put, on my ears (even when sweaty), work great in the rain, have amazing sound quality, and the battery lasts for hours! Moreover, I found that with other headphones I had to always increase the volume to nearly deafening levels to hear anything when outside... but with these, I can keep it at a nice level as the noise cancellation is above par. Well done!

Read this Review before purchase


I rarely write reviews so if I’m writing this, it’s because this product delivers.Let’s be realistic, if you buy this product and expect incredibly high quality performance out of it, you’re nuts - if you buy this product, and have hopes it’ll be good, you won’t be disappointed!Out of the box, the product is already quite impressive. The wrap around ear pieces are “soft” to say the least, and unlike most ear pieces of similar design, conform to the shape you bend them! A big plus! The product also comes with everything described, with the quality hard case being the most impressive.The next noticeable thing about this product as a whole is the voice commands it outputs when being operated - another leg up on other competitive brands.The sound quality delivers base wise - however, the wholeness of the sound, more or less the treble, isn’t quite all there. THIS IS NOT A DOWNSIDE! The product delivers way beyond the price it is being charged.If you purchase this product, I would be suprised if one were to be disappointed in their purchase!

Great for Work and Workout!


I use these every day at work, almost all day. I work as an RV detailer and I work outside in the heat. I sweat a lot, water is going everywhere and yet a month later they're still working like new! They charge back up really fast so they're always ready to go the next day and will last the full 8 hours. Only complaint is earwax will start to build up in the buds, but you can pop them off and use a tooth pick to clean them out. And if you wear glasses like me, the clips don't get in your way, you can just tuck them under the arms of your glasses and won't even notice them. Great purchase and well worth it!

Great gym earbuds!


I've only been using these headphones for a week but I am very happy with them. They cancel noise very well, they fit in my 6' adult male ears comfortably and stay put during hours in the gym. The battery last a long time and it's pretty easy to set up with an iPhone. The Bluetooth range is good. I can lay my phone down and walk around to equipment a few feet away and not loose the music. The bass is a little too powerful for my taste and there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust that. I haven't taken calls on them so I can't comment on that. In the end, the reason for the 5 stars is you won't be disappointed with these earbuds for the price. I purchased a pair of Bose bluetooth earbuds for my son for Christmas and there is definitely a sound quality difference but for a pair of workout earbuds and saving $100+, these can't be beat.

These headphones have great sound and a very fair price


These headphones have great sound and a very fair price.  I will second what others have said about the negatives:the over the ear hooks don't do much to keep them in place for vigorous exercising.  For jogging and weight lifting they fall out easily.  When I am doing work around the house, taking the dog for a walk, etc they are great and don't fall out.  Battery life seems to be about 4 hours for me before they beep every few seconds or keep saying ""connected"" every few minutes.  The beeping for low battery is annoying as I can look at the light and see if it is red or blue.  If you have eye glasses on at the same time as the headphones, you will get a flashing blue light reflecting of your right eyeglass lens every 5 seconds, which gets old.Overall, for the price they are nice, but not awesome.

Extremly good value....


I purchased these headphones recently primarily to use in the gym so that I wouldn't be attached to my iPod. These headphones are great. The sound is loud the bass pump strongly and the over-the-air attachment is flexible so that can be molded to your ear. I have often walked away from my iPod with these in my ear and didn't realize my iPod wasn't with me for 30 or 40 ft. At the low cost of this product I'm confident it will rival many many other Bluetooth headphones that cost a great deal more. I highly doubt you'll go wrong purchasing these. My pair included a charger that work with both Android as well as iPod connections this was just icing on the cake.

Disappointing


Disappointed because the connection with Bluetooth is cumbersome. I have to switch the headphones on and off several times. Also on occasions, it delivers garbled sound. Third downside is the earbuds, the soft ones have already fallen off while commuting.. and that makes the headphones unusable.The sound quality is good. But other aspects I mentioned are as important.  I am surprised by the ratings. Would prefer to return.

Couldn't be happier


Sounds way better than I thought they would for the price. Great bass and can go very loud. Never had any connectivity issues. Plus the company gives you a one year warranty. I do wish the ear hooks were a bit firmer as sometimes they started to slide/get pulled down as I move around. I would be glad to buy these againEDIT: Currently 9 months into using these almost daily. Never had any problems up until a few days ago when the left earbud stopped working. I contacted support and they responded faster than any support I've ever received. They were helpful, efficient, and when it came to it they were happy to replace them for me. I'm more than happy with this product and company

Great sound, great comfort, great value.


I've purchased, used, and discarded a number of Bluetooth headphones over the last couple of years and these are the best by a long shot. Syncing was a snap, comfort is great out of the box, and sound is fantastic. I do a lot of long-distance bicycle riding and have grown tired of constantly adjusting and re-adjusting the headphones as I ride. These stay put even during the roughest, sweatiest rides. I wear these in the office to listen to music in a rather noisy (talking, phone calls, and general office noise) and the sound dampening is pretty good. It's not on par with over the ear headphones but they're not supposed to be. If you're looking for highly functional, very comfortable headphones with great sound at a good price you really can't go wrong with these.

Easy to pair. I'm impressed with the bass quality!! I've never had earbuds produce bass quality as deep and rich as these... The low tones are something you'd expect from an over the head large headphone set.These things are going to take my long distance runs to a whole other level.The noise cancellation qualities are impressive as well. Haven't had them long enough to test battery life, but considering the size I expect to charge them after every use.

Very robust, great battery life, water resistant, inexpensive.... Made this wired-headphone lover change his mind


Apple forced me to make the jump to bluetooth, SENSO made it tolerable and at a low price. I love these little guys more than any wired headphone I've ever used.I've had one small bug which I'm not marking off for: I've used them probably 60 times in the 2 months but 1 or 2 times I had some connectivity issues. Powercycling the device fixes it. Seems like a bluetooth problem.If anyone compares these to the airpods, put it this way: You can buy three for the price of one set of airpods, for a combined battery life of like 26 hours.Typically I get about 7 hours off one charge. Ear buds are comfortable, comes with a car charger for this and lightening (what the heck? what a great value)--oh and it has 2 USB ports so you can do both at the same time. Comes with a case too but these are so darn robust I've sat on them twice now and they've held up.Sound quality is good too but since I take them running/mountain biking I may not be the best judge. They can get pretty loud if you want but the in-ear quality is such you wont need it.One problem: My wife has stolen them a few times. Buy at your own risk! I just bought a second set.

Not impressed


They arrived the next day, the packaging was good. Really liked they came with their own case and car charger included. They are really comfortable, I usually stay away from over the ear earphones because they tend to hurt my ears but these are extremely comfortable. 3 stars because there is a lot of static (spotty Bluetooth connection) when I put my phone in my running belt which goes around my waist. My belt isn't even thick... I got these earphones especially for running so it sucks especially paying so much for them.

Awesome bang for your buck value. These things rock!


These speakers are amazing. They are great for my Gym workout. They say they are waterproof but I have not tried that so I can not speak to that claim. They do hold a charge for a long time, and when you need to recharge them, they seem to charge quickly. They are comfortable in the ear and come with a lot of great accessories. These are a winner in my book. The price point feels like I should be paying double for these.

I had one pair last two years. I didn't like the ""upgraded"" version so I purchased another pair of the original model. They were constructed flimsier and cheaper like the ""upgraded"" ones.

Pretty Decent For The Price


First pair of wireless earbuds. I am mainly using them to Bluetooth to my TV while working out. I am impressed with all the extra wires and chargers that Senso gives. The sound seems very clear. A decent balance between bass and treble. I called into Senso tech support because the lowest volume was too loud for me (pairing to my IPhone). The tech support was very helpful and did a factory reset. That seemed to work. He also suggested an app (equalizer) to help.Overall seems like a really good purchase for under $30. My only complaint was I wish the ear gels were a little more comfortable (they are kind of thin). I did workout with them and they stayed in and connected the whole time. I would recommend them.

First, the headphones arrived earlier than expected. On top of that there was an extra high quality charging cable and a car charger. I don't know if that was part of the deal or is it because I'm special. Anyway these headphones are awesome. The earloops are kind of flimsy so I did not expected them to be stay in place. I love the sound coming out of these things. These are the loudest headphones I've owned (the other pair was the QY7 by soundpeats)

I wanted to love them...


I would have given a higher rating, but there is not a lot of flexibility in the volume control on the lower end.  For louder music, I am unable to turn the headphones down low enough. it goes from a bit too loud to completly off. Also, the recorded voice screams POWER ON or BATTERY LOW, even when you have the volume turned down. Aside from that, they are very comfortable and the battery lasts a long time.  I've been using them for 8 months now.  Pretty good until I find something else that has a more refined volume control.

""Low battery""


These headphones word really well and this is my second time buying them, I lost the first pair.  The reason I give it 3 stars though is because they start saying ""low battery"" every minute at 30% battery and then they completely die at about 25-30% battery.  This is very deceiving to me, you think you have enough battery for a workout then they quit 10 minutes into your work out and that's very frustrating.  So as long as you keep them fully charged, they work great.

I run, therefore I can tell you that they hold steady and specially the signal does not get lost. as It did with my previous ones. I use them at work so I don't carry my phone everywhere and the reception is pretty great, say 20 feet and two walls in between. The price is great since includes so many treat in the box, a car charger, a charger cord, case and ear pads to a perfect fit.

Man these headphones are not all that AT ALL. the microphone is SUPER LOW, you have to damn near yell for the other person to hear you. The noise cancelling SUCKS ASS.

I'm not a music geek, but I like the way these sound and the long playback life will do well for what I bought them to do. They fit fine and had a pair of foam eartips in addition to the silicone ones, which was a bonus for me since they give a great fit.  Even though the short charging cable was missing in the box (I will be contacting them for one), they are a great bargain for those that need or want a long playback life in between charges and not want to shell out a fortune.

Constantly cutting out


I've had these over 6 months now. I run with them every other day. They cut out constantly. It may just be that the bluetooth remains permiscious while connected to my cell phone, which would be idiotic. There have been a couple times when the cutting out was so bad I had to just pull them off and run the entire distance without them.  Outside of cutting out, the bass is very limited. The fit is nice though, and the controls for switching songs is easy enough to not be intrusive. But that all doesn't matter if it is cutting out too much to be able to hear your music/audio book/audio course/podcast.

Okay for the sale price. Decent sound quality.


These headphones look good and come in nice packaging. You would think they're pretty awesome. However, if you sweat too much, go 15 feet away from your phone, have an android, or are in a hot gym, they will not work optimally. Not the worst headphones I've ever owned, though. I guess they were worth it for the sale price.Would not be my first recommendation if you sweat a lot and like to do dynamic workouts that require you to put your phone on the ground while you exercise.

Cheap headphones won’t last long


These headphones WILL break. And when they do break, Senso will send you another broken pair.My initial headphones set lasted 8 months until the headset stopped charging. I called the office and received a new pair but this time the pair didn’t last longer than three months. It’s cheap so do not expect anything that’ll last long. My advice, keep your money for a nice pair or know you’ll only get a few months out of them.

Adequate value, short life


It worked pretty well for about 5 months - I use it primarily for workouts but also worked fine as a phone headset.Then the battery decided to stop holding a charge. By month 6 it would only hold charge for 5 minutes after a full night charging. For the price, it's not terrible but I would expect at least a year.The Bluetooth was wonky sometimes as well and would not always make it maintain a connection. This was typically solved by some combination of cycling the headset, phone Bluetooth, audio app, or some combination thereof

An amazing must buy!  Great sound and fit!


This was my first experience buying bluetooth headphones of any kind.  And I must say, I am more than satisfied!Pairing is easy, and since I'm a blind user who can't see any light, I appreciated the voice that tells me the headphones are on and connected!  I didn't expect a voice, so for that I was really excited!They are so comfortable.  The soft rubber feeling clip that goes around the ear is barely noticeable, I can forget they're in!I just love the round zipper travel case, I am that person who always has tangled headphones.  But I never will again!The multiple charging options, car charger, short USB cable, and longer micro USB cable made this buy even better.To top it off, the box it all comes in looks like the best Christmas present ever!Sound when listening to music is crisper than I've ever heard!  The range is perfect for in my house.  I love that these are sweat proof, as that was something I needed in my headphones.If you're looking for a good, well priced buy, look no further!  I'll be purchasing more of these so that my brother and husband can also have talking headphones.  They'll love knowing when they're turned on and connected too!!

After reading other reviews I was quite excited to give these a try.  I've recently started using public transportation and wanted good fitting buds that would help reduce the noise and provide me with some musical isolation.  I usually have to play these with my ipod cranked to full volume and the buds at full volume just to hear decently.  My hearing is not as good as it once was, but I was recently checked and told I'm hearing just fine.  For whatever reason, these are in the ""just okay"" category.  Price is good and they function.

The sound was good awful and I’m partially deaf so I like stuff to sound loud and good. These turned halfway up had distortion from the bass. Nope, Terrible even if they were 27 bucks. I’m deciding on wether or not I want to return them but it’ll cost me 8 dollars to return 27$ headphones. Might just give them away.

Decent sound and quality at a good price


I've had a chance to use these during workouts and for just listening. They have good sound and I like that the controls are easily accessible and intuitive. They stay in place while running. They're not audiophile quality but that shouldn't be expected at this price. They work well and I'm happy with them. It would be nice if they had some kind of power indicator but there's no display.

Best Value in Bluetooth Earbuds, Great Looking, too!


I really enjoy these and how the earbuds stay on my ears, unlike other buds that are always falling out and a struggle to keep placed in each ear.  The sound quality is not as good as I had expected, and the range of bluetooth is excellent and the battery capacity seems to be very good since I haven't run low on charge yet.  I like the design of having only the wire fall loosely on my neck rather than other designs where the in line switch dangles there and the volume/on switches are easy to operate mounted on the ear buds themselves.  The color scheme is excellent and these are attractive!  Also, the in-line mic for phone is able to pick up my voice pretty well and I don't have to yell when I am on the line.  I am really happy with my purchase.

I was considering returning them because they aren't my style (I prefer in ear buds) but I haven't been able to find a pair that's better than these, so I decided to keep them. I really like that the controllers are on the buds, the battery life is great (I get about 7 hours) and they don't constantly update me on the battery status. I use them to workout and they're great, the cord is long enough to tie them into my pony tail.

Awful sound. Sounds thin and lifeless. Weak build quality.


I bought these based on all the positive reviews and now I'm convinced those reviews have to be fake or coerced with free product by the vendor. These things are awful. They sound worse than earbuds! The absolute worst thing about these is the sound. Why even use headphones if they're not going to produce at least half way decent sound. The sound is harsh, thin, and shrill. On top of that, the build quality is flimsy.

but I've finally found comfortable earphones for my TINY ears


I am over the moon. It's been many years, but I've finally found comfortable earphones for my TINY ears. No matter what other earphones advertised, they always hurt after a few minutes. But these are comfortable and clear -- over an hour walk with wind and exertion, I didn't have to adjust the earphones once, and even with wind making sound on the outside of the earphones, the podcast was clearly audible.

Well-worth the money!


These earphones have a good sound quality and good bass for its price! I can't believe I got them for only $36. The battery life is excellent, it is very easy to use and to pair with my devices. It feels comfortable in the ears and doesn't sleep, and it's really convenient that SENSO gives a hard-shell carrying case along with it. I've used many headphones/earphones my whole life, and I can say that this pair is definitely worth more than what you're paying for. I'm so glad I bought them, I've already highly recommended them to my friends and family.

Great Customer Service!!


My earphones worked great for 8 months; the quality was good and they were easy to use. Also I loved that the original package included a phone charger as well as two headphone chargers. After 8 months they stopped charging so I emailed their customer service and immediately got a response of what to do to fix them. I followed their instructions to no avail so I emailed them back and they said they would send me new headphones as I was covered by a one-year warranty. It was so easy and they really helped me with my problem and cared that the headphones weren't working as they should be. Would definitely recommend!!

Sturdier than Sony


Bought these to replace a pair of Sony wireless earbuds where the on/off button fell off and got lost.  These earbuds fit well, have buttons that can't fall off and have good sound. I also liked the quick charge abilty. Instructions are also clear and easy to follow. Since my initial comment , I have used them many times in both long and short runs. They don't stay in place in my ears that well despite changing sizes in war pieces. They are ok if not running. Better for walking, biking, or just sitting and listening to music.

The rating of one star is based on the fact that the headphones kept unpairing with my iPhone.  Sometimes I couldn't get it to pair at all. Sometimes it would pair at home, but when I got to the gym it was unpaired. Wouldn't pair up again. Tried everything.  Never could tell when it was going to work. When it did,  the sound was great.

Tough on ears?


The sound quality is excellent. Clear crisp treble and rich vibrant bass. However, I have to deduct 1 star for ergonomics. First, maybe it's just me, but these are the most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever worn in my life. My ears are so sore I can't touch them without grimacing. I've tried the different cushions that came with the product but to no avail. After about 15 minutes, they're unbearable. I'm going to have to return them if I can't find a solution.

Goldilocks Headphones - Difficult to get ""Just Right""


My primary use is for these headphones is listening at work. I generally get 6-7 hours' listening time out of them, when using them constantly. Not much of an issue for me, as I always have a pair of wired earbuds with me and probably use them more than I do these, and I'm usually not getting a full 6-7 hours' listening time in at work anyway, due to meetings, etc.Sound quality is good, but difficult to adjust to a comfortable volume; I feel a little like Goldilocks--volume is either ""too loud,"" ""too soft,"" but never quite ""just right.""My initial review stated that they had failed after being in storage. I've since removed that comment: There was an audio issue with the podcasts I was listening to.

Why is there a continuous blinking light on at all times? I use these primarily in a darker setting and the blinking blue led is ridiculously obnoxious. I've put electrical tape over it.

These headphones fit well and stay on while being active.  However, they have terrible sound quality.  It is muddy, muffled, and awful.

Not great for women with smaller ears.


These really are not great headphones for a woman. The ear hooks extend half an inch over the top of my ear, which means they don't do anything to help keep the buds in place. As a result, the earbuds keep sliding out while I am working out. Since the power button is right where you would push them back into your ears, I keep accidentally turning them off in the middle of a workout while trying to keep them from falling off.

Ordered these headphones after my AYL BT headphones quit charging after a year of heavy use in the gym. It came in a fancy box with some nice additional products and was easy to operate and connect. However, they continued to fall out of place while running, which wasn't too big of a deal, and after a month of light use they've stopped connecting to my phone (iPhone 5s).

Spotty connection even when fully charged


Would be okay if it weren't for the fact that they have a spotty connection to devices even on a full charge. I got these on Tuesday. The sound is slightly less bass-y than Sony earbuds from Target for reference, but not bad. I can still enjoy songs when they are not skipping around and disappearing. Is the price worth it? I mean, I am free to jump around as I please while wearing them, but the spottiness does detract and pushes me to never want to purchase earbuds from Amazon again.

bluetooth connectivity is very spotty for music


I got this for use during my gym workouts and outdoor runs. Worked good for about 2 months, then I noticed spotty connectivity issues when playing music. It would skip beats in even slow playing music quite frequently. Since then it has been consistently getting worse. Now even while walking normally with the phone in my pant's pocket, the connectivity is very poor. The sound would skip for about half a second every now and then. I have tested this with multiple devices and it is the same. Would not recommend this product to a friend. I guess that is why it was so cheap.

I admit I started with reasonable expectations for the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones when I purchased them. I had seen more expensive headphones, but I liked the price point for my first set of wireless ones. When I got them, I was surprised by their sound and how long they last on a charge. I am pleased with their performance as I use them for 3-4 hours a day, and they go almost 3 days on one charge. I paired them with my phone, my PC, and a media streamer with no problems. Whether it was rock and roll or a movie, they worked great.I like the simplified controls on the headphones. They have a small indicator to show their status (very useful), a power button and a volume rocker. I will be interested to see how durable they are for daily use.I would definitely buy them again.

Decent BT earphones for the price. A little muted but not tinny.


Decent connection and battery life for the gym. Good selection of ear pieces including a compressible foam pair. Sound is not great - not tinny, but a little muted. Works well for phone calls. Water resistance seems to be intact. Doesn't move during exercise once the ear pieces are put in properly. Like the fact that the cord between modules is flattened and does not incorporate the mic so it doesn't bounce around like my other one.

About what you would expect for this price range


I bought these after my Sony headphones were stolen, and these definitely aren't as nice of quality but that's probably expected. They do the job though and I'd probably buy again, especially for the perks they come with. It is kind of annoying that the power button is on the side instead of the top of the ear bud because I have to push it against my ear drum or brace it awkwardly when I want to turn it off.

... headphones work well and stay on your ear much better than the non-looped versions


The SENSO headphones work well and stay on your ear much better than the non-looped versions.  This is a much bigger deal when running, as the earbud-only style fall out due to sweat and bouncing. They are easy to set up and connect to my iPhone automatically when turned on.Most importantly, I've found the SENSO client service to be outstanding.  I had a problem with an earlier purchased pair's LED light not working.  I contacted customer service about their 1-year warranty and they responded within an hour.  They offered a few FAQ style remedies, which I tried but did not work.  They again responded immediately and offered to send me a new pair.  I found this to be a refreshing experience that has made me a big fan of the company.

Don't stay on your ears very well.


Pro: Good sound and battery life.Con:  spend 90% of my workout put the headphones back on my ears.  The cord is grippy and the ear loops are not, so if you put the cord behind your neck, every time you turn your head it pulls the ear piece off you ear.If you put the wire in the front of your neck you only spend 75% percent of your workout putting the ear pieces back on you ears and the wire is in the way.

Excellent headphones, I wear them to run or go to the gym. Great sound quality, holds a charge for a long time. The earpieces are pretty comfortable too, unlike some other headphones I've worn. I sweat quite a bit and it doesn't seem to have affected them.  The microphone is ok, the people I'm talking to complain that I'm too quiet and hard to hear. I didn't buy them to make calls, so it's not really an issue for me.

Won't hold a charge - BUT - customer service is amazing!


These headphones will not hold a charge after a handful of weeks. First 2 weeks, they would hold a charge for about 5 -6 hours of use. Thereafter, the charge quickly dropped to about 2.5 hours. Only 6 weeks after purchase, they will not hold a charge.• However, I have been pleasantly surprised by the response from SENSO. Upon seeing my problem, they immediately reached out with troubleshooting assistance and finally a replacement.  I find it rare and refreshing that SENSO not only states that they are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction but that THEY ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR PROMISE OF SATISFACTION.

Great for a year.  . .


This is the wife. I bought these for my husband for his birthday a year and a half ago because he had been wanting to get Bluetooth headphones for work. After reading the reviews it seemed like these would be great! And they worked great for the most part. Up until a few weeks ago when they completely stopped working, even after my husband had taken really good care of them since we dont have a lot of money.The voice that says 'power on' sounds like it's from a horror film and they don't even connect to devices any more making them completely obsolete. I got these because we figured we get a few years out of them but couldn't even make it to two years unfortunately. Get them if you're ok getting new ones every year.

Great product & customer service


These were the first earbud-style headphones I could wear that didn't fall out. Absolutely love them. They come with three different size pieces to fit in the ear. I bought them based on other reviews. I just wanted something inexpensive to use with my tablet when working out. I liked the fact that I wouldn't be out of pocket much if they didn't work for me. The first pair quit charging or turning on, and the company replaced them under the warranty. Their customer service was fantastic. I contacted them via email and they responded within 24 hours to every message. They started the process even while we tried to troubleshoot the issue, and the replacements were sent out very quickly. I'm still very happy with the headphones, and their customer service is great! Would definitely recommend these.

Not top tier headphones, but great for the price!


For less than $40, you really can't go wrong with these headphones.  I use these when I run and work out at the gym, and I sweat like crazy but have never had an issue with sound or malfunctioning.  I've had them for about six months and have just recently had an issue with pairing to my smartphone.  However, I contacted the company and let them know my issue.  They responded within an hour with a step-by-step way to resolve the problem.  It was an easy fix and they're back to working normally.  Great customer service!  Like I said, for a value-based pair of headphones used for when you work out or other activities these are definitely worth it in my opinion.

My favorite headphones


I love these things.  I use them for work, for workouts, and for leisure.  Battery life is pretty good.  The one thing that bothers me is that the piece that ties the two earphones together.  Sometimes this will get caught awkwardly on my neck which can cause one of the earphones to get pulled out of my ears.  Happens more in active situations like running.

If you make 250k or more, buy beats, otherwise...


Rated a 4 high because of value being high. Better sound quality would make it a 5 at this price level. I’ve owned 3 pairs of beats. 2/3 broke. Both sound adjustable piece broke on beats and one completely stopped working. And the last one barely holds a charge. At the price of the senso it’s no big deal to buy a couple pairs a year, but hope I don’t have to

Perfect for the gym


They are sweat resistant and stay on my ears through any activity. Come with 3 different sizes of inner ear pieces. The part around your ear is like silicone and super flexible, which I think makes them fit better than being a hard plastic. Connect perfectly every time, long range, never an issue there. I wouldn't call these noise cancelling, but the sound quality is seriously amazing! They can also get super loud, too. I would highly recommend these to anyone with an active lifestyle. Whether you're deadlifting, running, hiking, or anything in between, I would highly recommend!

Very Happy with SENSO Wireless Headphones!


I am so pleased with the SENSO wireless earbuds!  I've tried three other sets in the past year and a half and none were of this quality nor did they last more than a few months.  I'm using these with a TV transmitter to better hear the dialogue in movies.  Pairing with my TV transmitter was easy.  The reception is clear, no static as I had with other brands.  I changed the ear buds to the smallest size and they fit comfortably for hours of movie viewing.

Amazing Sound, Outstanding Quality, and comes with a LOT of Accessories!


Of course, 36 bucks and a non ""Big Name Brand"" had me a bit skeptical... But these earebuds are a clear definition of quality.  Senso really beat my expectations here.  You know that these guys yell ""Quality"" when they add so many little accessories.  Why would a company who sells cheap things waste their time by adding accessories.  Senso isnt one of those ""cheap companies"". These things are amazing.  The unit comes with:-a long Iphone charging cable-an earbud charging cable-replacement earbud tips (with one of the pairs being a ""earplug"" material that cancels sound and mold to your ear, so you can only hear your music!)-Quality carrying pouch (with little mesh pockets inside)-a USB Car adapter with 2 USB Ports.  One port is 2.1 AMPS and the other is 1.0 AMP.Senso took the time to add a bunch of accessories to their already-amazing product, which tell the consumer that they want us to have the best experience.  The sound is great! Very clear!  Setup is a breeze! For under 50 bucks, I can assure you skeptical buyers that these will blow your mind!

These headphones are perfect! They fit very snug around my ear and don't come loose when running or exercising. They are super loud, which I love! My previous headphones (skull candy) weren't loud enough to cancel out the super loud gym music in the background, but with these I don't hear any outside noise whatsoever! It comes with a super handy round zip up case you can store the head phones in, a portable car charger that has two ports, and a dual USB (one for iPhone and one for android) I would def. recommend these headphones to anyone in the market for Bluetooth headphones that aren't a nuisance, sound great, and can hold a charge!

Connection Issues

I've had these for a few weeks.  Love them.  They do not fall out while running.  The connecting cord is lightweight and is barely noticeable.  They produce nice sounding music, and the microphone works well for calls.  I have not had any issues with blue tooth connectivity; I typically carry my phone on my waist band.I had a plantronics headset forever, but it finally broke after years of hard use.  I actually like these much better.  Looking forward to logging many miles with these puppies.

Great sound for a wireless set.


This review is rather early but so far I like them. Paired with my cell phone rather easily and sounds great, in fact better, louder than the OEM pair that came with my Note 3. Like the way they hug my big ears and don't expect them to fall off. Haven't tried them on the treadmill yet & may update this review if my sweat causes them to fall off. Havent tried any other wireless headphones but the sound compares to my wired beats at a much better price.

AWESOME wireless headphones.  Used them at the gym and they didn't move an inch and typically i struggle with headphones that can tolerate the various movements in weight lifting.  Excellent noise cancellation resulting in quality sound.  Paired easily with my IPhone 6S Plus and no interruption to signal even when my phone wasn't immediately next to me.

Pretty good product


I bought two of this sports wireless headphone, and satisfy with the quality of the product. One for myself and another for my friend in New Zealand as Christmas gift. I want to make sure the product has no any issue so I did open the one for my friend and test it before I ship it to New Zealand. The sound quality was pretty good, and everything went well too. The shipping time was kind of long since Utah had snow during the time, but it was not really matter to me. If someone wants to ask me whether I would recommend this product to other people? The answer is yes. Hope this product will go well after a while.

Feels cheep and flimsy.  The right ear hook broke off after a few uses. Battery charge only seems to last a few hours. The sound was good. And the Bluetooth connection was good as well  But the overall build quality was poor. I would not recommend these at all. And the price seems to jump around.  As of 10/06/18 the price is $29.98. But when i bought them they were $19.00.  My advice shop around.

SENSO Bluetooth Headphones


Terrific pair of headphones.  They sound great and are really comfortable to wear.  The packaging is compact and the zippered storage case is small and lightweight.  I plan on purchasing a second pair for my wife to use while we workout and go for walks.  The fact that they come with a one year warranty is commendable.  The additional items that are included in the order was a nice surprise, especially the cord that has the USB connector on one end and the convertible connector on the other end (iphone or Samsung type).  Since this review is based on a short ownership time, I will re-evaluate this product after several months of usage, but as it stands now, I highly recommend these.

I have only had to charge them when I got them and have got about 4-5 hours out of them already at the gym & no low battery warning. I can also leave my phone in the locker when I shower afterwards and wear them in the shower without worrying that they are being damaged. I am very impressed so far.

Cuts out like a 1990 CD player in a dune buggy!


Music cuts out frequently.  I have tried every possible configuration and I can still not keep a good bluetooth connection without these headphones cutting out.  I have tried Iphone, older ipod, new ipod, etc... ipod in left pocket, right pocket, back pocket, etc.... I still have signal loss numerous times during every walk.  It is extremely frustrating.  Unfortunately, because of my stubbornness to make these work and reading all of the amazing reviews, my return window has closed, so now I am stuck with them.  I am not sure how these things are getting so many positive reviews.

They work!


I was worried that these headphones would have awful sound quality, flimsy construction or a poor bluetooth connection because of the price. I experienced none of those problems. They stay on snugly and stand up to sweat - a big improvement over the wired earbuds I had been using. I'm sure the sound quality of a more expensive pair would be better, but I'm no audiophile and mostly listen to podcasts or audiobooks.

Very pleasing, excellent product!


Had these now for three months, and they're excellent, especially for their price. I think they're supposed to be noise cancelling, but after having used the Bose QC headphones on aircraft, these do not come close in the noise cancellation department. That is, unless I can figure out a way to push them deeper into my ear canal which I don't think I (or anyone) should do. Anyway, for the purpose I purchased them for, as a blue tooth headset for my cell phone, they are perfect.

First experience with Bluetooth technology


I am a 70 year old who has never used bluetooth before but I am glad to dispense with all the wires while listening to audiobooks and music  on my computer and other devices such as my cd player and iPod.  It took me a bit of time to figure out how to put it on, but the sound is good as long as I don't get too far away from my device.  The sound seems very clear and the assorted ear pieces are very handy.  I used the smallest and it fits fine.

Better than the other guys?


There's not much to be said that's not already been said with over 23,000 reviews...These only fit my ears with the foam inserts.  Your mileage may vary but with the other inserts, the headphones fell out of my ears.  That doesn't take any value away from the headphones for me however since they work great with the red foam inserts.  I'm not an audiophile so as long as they sound ""good"" then it's OK with me and these fit in that category just fine.  My only complaint is the wind noise and it's minimal while running.  I've never listened to the name brand to which this model competes but for the price I think this model certainly ""beats"" the rest.

Decent connectivity and fit, but pros end there


They are okay for the price, but don't be fooled into the reviews that claim these work as well as the beats. Connectivity is fine, the fit is fine, but the sound quality is definitely not on par with beats or even other similarly priced wireless earphones. I wanted to give it a try for a while to make sure that it wasn't an illusion but I have used these for months and it seems clear; the volume is not equal on both sides. Right ear bud is noticeably louder than the left, and this bugs the crap out of me. I am not sure if it's just mine that has this problem, but one side being noticeably louder has been a big enough problem that I end up not using them at the gym half of the time.They may be okay if you just want cheap wireless earphones for listening to podcasts and etc., but I would not recommend if you are thinking that you will get high quality sound for music in general.

Charges quickly, long battery life, stays in your ears.


I hardly ever write reviews but these headphones are a phenomenal value.  The sound quality is adequate but I mean come on for what you pay for them you're getting your money's worth.  These things really shine in that they charge exceptionally fast.  The  battery life is phenomenal.  You can make and answer calls.  And, perhaps most importantly, they stay firmly in your ears even during the most strenuous exercise.  Save a ton of cash and buy these instead of $100+ in ear headphones.  Note: they do not look cool though so if that's a concern you're going to want to look elsewhere.

For this price point, these ear buds are unbelievable. Unparalleled battery life versus anything you can get at Walmart, and the sound quality leaves nothing to be desired. Yeah, if you are an audiophile you can probably find some better sounding ear buds but no where near at this price. I have had these buds for over a year now and they are my tried and true pair whether I am going out to eat, going to an event, or even during work. They double exceptionally well as a way to answer phone calls while in public with their intuitive and easy to use controls. You can even skip a song by pressing the volume ""+"" button twice!

Ordered these headphones in January 2017, and they did just fine for the majority of the time that I had them.  Within the past week, the headphones lost the ability to charge, and the ability to connect to any of my devices.  I am certain that they have enough ""juice"" left in them, as I can turn them on just fine and the lights will blink red and blue.  I just got off the phone with customer service to see what I could do to fix this problem, and they confirmed that this is, in fact, an issue with the headphones themselves, but that my 1 year warranty will not cover a replacement, as it expired this week.  How convenient.  I am extremely disappointed in the way that the customer service representative spoke to me (harsh and outright rude), and I am bummed about their lack of a suitable option to fix the issues.  I would have gladly recommended these to a friend as a cheap, comfortable option, had it not been for the atrocious response malfunctions that came out of nowhere.

Amazing sound and ease of use.


So far so good...I am really happy thus far with the sound quality and ease of use of the Bluetooth Headphones by Senso.  I am highly impressed with the sound definitions. They sound amazing. Customer care and follow up is outstanding as well. When was the last time you heard from one of the owners of a company checking on your purachase??  Well, I did. And I love it. Also, these babies come with a 1 year warranty. Like I said,""so far so good"".

No regrets, everything promised was delivered.


I hesitated to purchase ear buds over a head set but I needed something small and portable for travel. The other reviews sold me and so I add my own.Pairing, super easy and works on multiple devices. Sound quality listening is fine for me, abet I am not an audiophile and I mostly listen to videos and make calls. Making calls and my voice quality, I have no complaints and I've asked most of my first 12 calls how I sounded. Charging time is much longer than I've allowed. I've gone 5+ hours and I'm sure I could have gone longer. Accessories are everything you need, which is amazing to me for the price.I haven't tested the waterproofness but I have no doubts since other reviews rave. I'll add my two thumbs up for this product's value for the price.

Good sound, mic catches wind noise really bad


Okay, so 2 stars may seem a bit harsh, but I promise you the reasons are valid when judged from a trail runner's perspective.First- some credit where credit is due-1.  These headphones have a nice strong connection and I never had the Bluetooth drop.2.  The sound quality was actually quite good.3.  Came with a nice carrying case and charge cords.Now for the critiques-1.  The biggest and most glaring flaw was the static from wind blowing into the mic.  It was so loud that I could barely even hear the music at times and their was only a slight breeze.  I'd love to say I was running so fast that I was creating a ton of wind, but alas- any mic should be able to stand up to a 9 minute mile and this one failed miserably.2.  The over the ear clips are way too flimsy and as a result, the right earbud continuously fell out through out the run and no, I'm not a super bouncy runner.3.  Then because it kept falling out, I had to keep pushing it back in.  The only problem is that the mute button is right on the side of the main piece so pushing it back in on the move almost always muted it.  Poor design if it won't stay securely in the ear.Long Story short- if you're going to be doing fairly low motion, indoor type activities with these- these will be great as I had no complaints with the sound quality.  However, if you're going to be outside biking, running, skiing or skydiving- you might want to consider something else.

Good quality, but seemingly Fluctuates


So I had these for about 2 years before they broke and thats fine as I had accidentally put it through the wash and they still worked that pair I had would be 5 stars but since I bought a new pair I have to degrade them to 4 stars the ear hooks are way too large the original ones (shown in the pictures) were way better and I don't know this for a fact but it seems to me that the Bluetooth range is smaller than my last pair.

So far, So GOOD!


Bought as a replacement for my running headset.  Previous was cheap and did not work right after a month of running.  When I received package it was like I got something from Apple.  Very professional-looking in its packaging and came with an abundance of accessories for every situation (wall outlet, car charger).  Received company email after receiving headphones in mail and was impressed.  Haven't had any problems and the material is stable and seems built to withstand sweat from shorting or damaging headphones!  Will keep you all in mind when I need a future replacement!  Thank you!PS. Perhaps attach an elastic band to wires so it feels more snug around head.  An adjustable wire of some sort.

Bought these for work, as a construction worker. I’ve tried a few types so far, and these seem to work the best.  The battery only lasts about 7 hours though for continuous playing of music. I’ve had other pairs last an entire work day, but these are comfortable and have good sound. So I just turn them off at lunch to give me a little extra time.

Best 30 bucks you can spend on head phones. They are not Bose or Beats, bit for 30.00 dolaars, you know that's not what you are buying. The sound quality is grat and they fit comfortably. The bluetooth is easy to set up and I had no connection issues. They come in a nice carrying case with cords and a car charger. They just don't have a wall outlet for them to charge, but you have 10 laying around because of all your phone chargers.

I like the way that they fit. The sound was good  I purchased three pair of these and hardly worn them five or ten times. One pair will light up like they are charging with the red light. But when I go to turn them on nothing happens.  I feel like taking a hammer 🔨 to them. Instead I just tossed them. I have two pair left. We will see what happens.

Great quality sound both playing music and good mic pick up for phone calls (a lot better than I'd thought it would be for calls).  As a result I ordered a second pair -- one to keep in my workout bag and another to use at home in our hot tub or sometimes I use them at my desk too.  My 4 vs. 5 star is the cord is long (which is fine) needs a small rubber grommet to tighten up around the back of your neck.  Obviously I have made it work which is why I ordered the second pair for my use (so I have them available in different places).

I tried this headphones with an audio book.  The sound quality from this headphones is clear.  For me, the headphones is not comfortable.  I have small ears, and small ear canals.

Not a Good Investment


I've used these headphones for a few months now. You get about a week of play time if you hit the gym 5-7 days a week, &  listen for 60-90 minutes. The more time goes on the less these headphones work. If I get a dumbbell too close to my phone the music starts skipping, if I walk more than a few benches over the music stops playing, if I even put my phone in the waist band of my leggings the music skips.

Got a pair for myself and my boyfriend. The sound is really good. So happy when it came with three ear insert sizes and a foam ear insert. The carrying case is sturdy. Be careful if you get this since putting the headphones in the carrying case sometimes accidentally push the power button so the headset turns on when you may not even mean for it to. The volume works really well also.

worked great for one week


Its a great deal, and these are very comfortable to wear unfortunately the battery life pooped out after one week. The car charger that is included has been very handy, I was charging them on my way to the gym. It got to the point where they wouldn't turn on unless I pulled them in, even for a few minutes. Now, the blue light will indicate a full charge however, they won't even turn on. I have tried resetting them several times. I dealt with the poor battery life for quite some time, but it times for me to move on to a different product. For the price, there is a lot included with these ear buds, but be prepare for them to not last very long.

Amazingly pleasant Surprise


Bought for Step Son. So these are quotes from him... ""Amazing, louder than my Beats by Dre. Looks to be very durable I have only had them for a week or so. They have been stepped on, knocked the volume button out. I put it back in and it still works perfectly. I wear them at work in a high heat environment so they get really wet for sweat, no problems after several 12 hour shifts. Seems to have good battery life 7-9 hours. I get lunch around 6 hours and put 15-20 minute charge on them and they go to the end of the shift and more."" I am impressed enough by his reaction and every day telling me to get a pair for myself that I'm going to get a set in a different color (man i wanted that red) plus what I heard from his set being held up by my ear, loud with good bass and clear highs.

Anatomically Unique


I purchased these hoping they would provide me a good set of ""study"" earphones that would block out surrounding sound and not be too bulky. I prefer in ear and not over ear. However, for the life of me these would not stay in my ears. I tried all the attachments. And I was even sitting down. I can't imagine what would have happened if I had used them on a run. I emailed INVOTEK and the response I got was to try all the sizes of ear buds, but that ""it is possible that due to anatomical uniqueness the size might not be perfect for everyone."" So yeah. I buy their product, it doesn't work, and they tell me my ears are weird.

These earbuds live up to their description.  The battery life lasts long and they charge pretty quickly.  The range is great.  It is convenient and easy to set up.  The warranty is definitely worth it just in case.  The case is hard and durable.  I expected the hooks to be hard plastic, but like that they are comfortable.

Great sound and battery life in an inexpensive product


Great sound and battery life in an inexpensive product.  I'm only at the end of week-one with Senos Active but I'm happy with my choice. The earbuds fit comfortable and do not cause discomfort after extended periods of use.  Claimed battery life seems accurate at ~8 hours.  Only thing I could want is track control buttons (Figured out after a couple weeks that a long press on the up and down volume is track control).10-month follow-up.Headset was working great for 1-2 hours of use per day until the left earpiece started shorting out. I contacted the Amazon vendor, Tekatron, and they helped troubleshoot and then replace the headset. Despite the malfunction, the overall experience has been great. This headset is perfect for running, has good audio quality, and great support from the vendor and manufacturer.

These are good sounding earbuds for the price


These are good sounding earbuds for the price.  Plenty of different sized tips for ear canal sizes, has a car charger, and nice cable that works for android or apple lightning connector.  I have used these buds since May of 2017 pretty much every day, 8 hours a day listening to podcasts or music.  You can take calls, ignore calls, etc.  Only thing I don't like is the flimsy wire that connects the two buds together.  I have one side that is shorting out, but the company is honoring their 1 year warranty, and sending me out a new pair.  Are they Beats?  No, but they are darn close, and for the person who is just using these to work out or go for a bike ride, etc. they would be fine.  As a mechanic, I am constantly in different positions, and the wire sometimes gets in the way.  Those are minor issues though.  For the money, you can buy 3 pairs of these, and still wouldn't be as pricey as a set of Beats.

Good but issues


Pros: Fits well and stays put through workouts and sound is great for the price range.Cons: Constant disconnects, like record/ cd skipping about once a minute. Did test with different phones (Apple and Droid) and issue was consistent regardless if phone was 1 foot away or 10 feet.  More testing found just tilting my head in certain positions would cause this to the point of full disconnect. Not sure if the Bluetooth receiver is in the ear buds or the connecting strap but definitely an issue that at times will have you wanting to just drop them in the trash.

Worth it for runners


Very bassy. It’s distracting for listening not during activities. The button on the side turns them on and when double tapped it dials the last number. That’s a little annoying. Call quality is great though. They stay in place quite well. The wire is a little sticky and can start to pull a little. The over ear arms are bendable and really help dial in the fit.

Great for Music BUT Bad for Phone Calls


I was attracted to this item because of the positive reviews of it's sound. And, YES, the sound is very good for music. The deep bass and snug fit provide an excellent music listening experience. HOWEVER, having a normal phone conversation is another thing. So many times the person on the other end tells me that they are having a hard time hearing me because of all the background noise. The microphone is so sensitive, that the background noise overpowers my voice and drives the people on the other end crazy. Even when I am driving in the car with the radio off and the windows rolled up, people complain about the noise. Only when I am at a stop light do they say it sounds better. Even while shopping at a store, my dad said that the elevator music playing in the back by the store was so distracting. I am just using these headphones now for listening to music and cringe every time I have to apologize on the phone for the loud sounds coming from my surroundings, which are minimal. I think it would be a great product if it functioned better on phone calls.

Only the squishy foam ear pieces don't fall out of my ears.  However, they are decent headphones for the price.  I must have my phone in my right back pocket or they skip.  And don't even think about bending over or turning your head away from your phone.  I managed to kind of fix that problem by clearing the cache on my Bluetooth settings on my phone, but I have to do it literally every single time I turn these things on.

This is not a paid review. I am a college student who uses this practically all day: on my walk to/from/between classes, when studying, or jogging. That means I use it from 9 AM to around midnight sporadically. It lasts all day and I charge it every night. Great connectivity. This works exactly like it's supposed to and while it is not the best quality it is decent. It gets the job done and for 20$? Dirt cheap. It comes with a card holding thing to stick on your phone and a magnetic car mount as well as a case and charging table.  Best Value you can get in terms of quantity and quality.

Beware...Decent headphones but constantly cuts out.


The design on these are pretty good. They stay in my ears because the ear hooks are easy to bend and manipulate so they stay in place.The sound is OK.  A little bass heavy, which I like. Kind of average over all.The biggest flaw is connectivity. I have a Samsung Note 8 and unless I'm sitting still not moving, they cut out constantly. If I put them in my pocket they cut out every time I move. I can't jog or work out with them at all. Best case scenario if I hold my phone in my hand and don't move much they don't cut out. It's a shame because otherwise they aren't bad headphones.

Good sound but heavy with floppy ear pieces


Good sound. Deeper bass than any other low priced earbuds I've tried. Great value too. It comes with a case and car charger. The only thing I don't like is that the ear pieces are just soft silicon that are non-adjustable and they don't fit me well so offer absolutely no support. The ear pieces just flop around and get in the way of my glasses. Otherwise, these earbuds feel like they are good quality and well built but this also means they are on the heavy side.

These headphones are reasonably comfortable to wear


The battery life is nowhere near what the product claims it to be, and there's no way to know the status of the battery before it reaches ""low battery"". The sound quality isn't even up to par with $15-20 ear buds you can find at Target. These headphones are reasonably comfortable to wear, and not at all intrusive. Yet, for the ubiquity of wireless bluetooth headphones these days, the price of these are not at all worth it.

Fairly disappointed in these. I have problems keeping a good connection when I put my phone in either front or back pocket. And I can't get very far from the Bluetooth source before losing connection. I had really cheap set that I got for $14.00 at OfficeMax a few years, they didn't make it through the washing machine but they would sure keep a connection. I could 75 feet or so across the gym and still have clear music with those. I wouldn't say these are a total waste but I would search around. Won't buy these again when they get washed.

This is my first pair of Bluetooth headsets so I have nothing really to base the quality of sound other than my own hearing and I'm very pleased with them. The company is by far one of the best at customer service I've dealt with on Amazon. For under 40.00, you get a quality headset,  nice carrying case, different cables and earbud sizes. The box is nice, even the instructions are made on premium paper with a glossy finish and well written english. And if all of that wasn't enough,  they come with a one year warranty.

Perfect for gym rats


I absolutely love these things! I use them primarily in the gym and after 5 months, they are still holding up very well. I sweat like a mad man when I workout, and these have handled it like a champ. Even a couple of trips into the sauna didn't have an adverse affect on them. I haven't tested the claim of being waterproof, but surviving my sweaty workouts is more than good enough for me. The ear hook could fit a little better, but that just may be due to the shape of my ears. For the money I spent verses the usage I have gotten, I am beyond pleased with this product.

Product should be hassle-free. While the setup is easy, (you set it up like any other bluetooth device), there are many downsides and reasons why I regret my purchase:1. The sound works clearly maybe 50% of the time. I am using an iPhone 6, so bluetooth capability on my device is not an issue. It cuts in and out constantly.2. Battery life: lasts a few hours, which means I am charging it everyday.3. Volume control: The lowest volume setting is way too loud, especially considering the earbuds are directly in your ear.4. Price: They advertise that it was originally $160: no it wasn't. It has never sold for more than $60.Recommendation:Buy a name brand headphone and spend a little more to have a stress-free experience.

Very satisfied!


I read several reviews on many different sites and they are all pretty accurate. These truly are the best Bluetooth headphones you can buy for under $50 if not the best under $100. These are crazy loud and have extreme bass. However, the only negative I can offer is that it does distort at max volume and there is almost too much bass. That being said, these headphones are much better all around when compared to my $100 LG headphones. The accessories you receive are just a huge bonus. I own a pressure washing business ( RinsePRO.com ) and I purchased these to use while working. I'm eager to see how they hold up to the water.

Great headphones.  Great customer service.


I purchased these headphones for my son as a holiday gift.  The earbuds are awesome and were exactly what I was looking for without having to pay the Dr. Dre prices.  The only reason I'm not giving them a full five stars is because the left earbud stopped producing sound only after less than two months of use. However, because I had followed the seller's suggestion to register the product on their website, I was able to contact them via email and they were extremely customer service friendly. They first responded with instructions to try a full factory-reset but it didn't work.  So they sent me a full replacement pair.  The whole process from beginning to end took less than a week to resolve. I understand that hiccups happen and I am much more likely to give the seller the benefit of the doubt when they provide the stellar service that SENSO did (five-star customer service).  I will wait to see if I have the same issue with these earbuds and up the number of stars appropriately if not.

but outgoing sound from the microphone was even worse. Call recipients reported horrible sound quality


When using them just as headphones, music sounded very muted and somewhat muffled. Overall I would rate the sound from these as ""terrible"". Using them to make phone calls, the sound was still muted and muffled, but outgoing sound from the microphone was even worse. Call recipients reported horrible sound quality. So to check for myself, I had my wife call me using theses and I confirmed the sound was absolutely terrible. It sounded as if she was 30 feet from the mic, no matter how loud i turned the volume up on the receiving phone, I could not hear her.I imagine it is possible that I received a defective unit since I saw many positive reviews on them. But I am unwilling to try another pair.I would not recommend these for any reason.

Good, but not the best


As an active person who uses headphones 5 days out of the week really can't be too disappointed that they wear out quick. 7 months is how long this brand lasted. Longer then my beats so that's to say something. I can no longer charge the headphones because the charging port on the headphones just wore out. Sound quality is good, not Bose quality but decent enough if your looking for something that's better then you would expect.

A great value with excellent customer service.


They're very comfortable and they stay in place during vigorous activity - even when drenched in sweat. The bluetooth range is great and the controls are intuitive.The one and only problem (and it's a big one) - the frequency response is definitely not flat (at least to my ears). Way, way, way too much bass - lacking clarity in the mids and treble - whatever, they still sound better than any other earbuds I've owned.Just don't expect them to match quality over-ear headphones (as in Sennheiser or Ars Technica NOT that Beats garbage).EDIT: The first pair of these that I wrote the above review for suddenly stopped working, and the company sent me a new pair within 2 days of making a warranty claim with no hassles.

No small ears...


I don't have freakishly small ears, but for an adult they are on the small side. I was hoping with how flexible the material is maybe the fit would work out, but it doesn't and they look ridiculous. They are not adjustable beyond the ear bud covers they come with. The sound is good, for as long as they stay in my ears.So if you have large or average size ears, these are great! If you have small ears, keep shopping.

Not enough treble


I mean, I love the fit.  But, I think it's too bassy.  I wish the treble could be adjusted...  I'll try them for a couple more weeks.  My ears aren't that great, so I'm sure these sound awesome for someone without hearing damage. More treble would be nice.  It sounds muffled.A month, or so later.  These buds are AWESOME... I adjust them in my ear to allow for a balance of bass and treble, if that makes any sense :)

Build quality is good, audio not as good


I bought these headphones for weight lifting and running. So far they are working perfectly for that. The ear ridges hold onto your ears while you run so that you don't have to worry about constantly readjusting them. The waterproofing is also really handy so that sweat doesn't end up damaging the earbuds themselves. So far they hold better battery life than any other bluetooth earbuds I have bought. The only issue i'm having is that the sound quality is lacking. The lows and mids really draw out and I can barely hear any of the highs or treble. I currently use an equalizer to crank up the treble so that I can at least hear some of it. But even then, the audio quality just seems to lack. Overall, the build quality was really thought out and is very good, but the audio quality doesn't quite match. I would still recommend these to a friend because of how well build they are.

Powerhouse Earbuds


Amazing range. I've had two other pair of Bluetooth earbuds, and both seemed okay, but the minute I so much as put my iPhone in my pocket the connection broke up. With these I can stroll into the next room without so much as a hiccup. And they can get plenty loud if you want them to. Like, really REALLY loud. A little heavy on the bass, so listening to podcasts can be a bit muddy, but if you like your music with plenty of thump, these are your new best friends.  Comes with a zippered hardcase, a couple of charger cables (one of which is a brilliant USB/mini-USB/Apple Lighting combo), a car adapter, and a nice selection of different sized ear-cushions, so if they're not quite comfortable for you right out the box, don't worry, they will be.

Very satisfied with purchase


My previous headphones (which were half as expensive) had a very limited range, so much so that I had to have my phone in my jacket pocket instead of my pants pocket or it would cut out. This lead to my phone flying out of my pocket and busting the screen on the ground so I decided it was time to up my bluetooth game.The Senso headphones not only have great bluetooth range but the sound quality is better and with the over-the-ear hook, I can wear them at the gym even while doing exercises on my back where the previous pair used to fall off and/or out of range. I happily recommend these headphones to others. They're well worth the money.

Impressed with the product!!!


Incredibly impressed with these headphones.  So I've bought a few bluetooth headphones before but there was always something I did not like.  Either the sound quality was garbage or they did not last long, or actually fit my ears.  SENSO changed that and blew it out of the water completely.  Opening the box and seeing everything included, you can tell that the company takes pride in their brand.  There are plenty of instructions and the headphones are easy.  For the price, these are the best headphones I've ever used. I train hard in the gym and do quite a bit of cardio and I don't sweat, I rain.  These are truly sweat proof and stay in my ears and are super comfortable.  The sound quality is crystal clear compared to other bluetooth headphones I've had.  These are a seriously high quality product for the price and I would order these all over again.  Well done.

So far so good.  I had a bit of trouble finding the right fit for the ear buds and I had hoped the part that goes over the ear would have been a hard plastic verses a soft bendy piece, however, I ran a 1/2 marathon in a strong wind this weekend and they worked well.  Stayed in for the most part with little adjusting.  I do find I get static while listening to music - they aren't crystal clear, but they still are good.

I've used these for a while now and can recommend the product.  I've never had a blue tooth device that could hold up the amount of sweat I produce until now.  In fact, they recently went through the washing machine.  My wife brought them to me and said if they still worked to order her a pair.  I charged them up and have been using them for a couple weeks now (since the washing) without a single problem so I just ordered a pair for my wife.

Horrible Bluetooth connection reliability


I have had these headphones for 2 months now. First, I must be fair and admit that the battery life is better than average and they are comfortable. The largest issue with this product is the Bluetooth connection. At first, the connection was sub-par, now there are 25-50 seconds gaps in connection, and mind you that I never go further than 4 feet away from the device that the headphones are connected to. If I am studying and I turn my head too quickly the connection will be lost and the music stopping and starting constantly makes it very difficult to keep my focus. If I am exercising with them I run into the same issue. I am so tired of buying Bluetooth headphones several times throughout the year, please give me suggestions on reliable Bluetooth headphones that will last a year or longer, have a strong Bluetooth connection, 8+ hours of battery life, and are comfortable to wear.

Poor connection, poor audio quality


Very poor bluetooth connection - just about anything in the line of sight will cause a connection cutout.  Sound quality is subpar.  Somewhat painful in ear ( no, I don’t have small ear canals). Don’t stay put during active movement.  Pushing pause tends to open some other random app and start playing something or dial your last call.  If you're looking for a cheap bluetooth earbud, these work, but you get what you pay for.

I've been using this daily ever since it arrived and I'm very pleased with it. The headphones come with a car charger which also includes a bonus lightning adapter which was a nice surprise. I feel it is well worth the price I paid.

Nice sound quality


Pros:Nice sound quality.Easy to connect to devices.Buttons to control sound volume and calls on right headphone work well.Mic seems to work pretty well.Cons:The light that tells you it's charging doesn't show up half the time when I plug it in to charge. It also doesn't seem to charge when I use my microusb cable for my android phone and only charges with the extremely short cord that came with it. It's annoying to carry around both when they both have the same ends (usb and microusb).When I disconnect them from my phone and reconnect them, the sound is super choppy and of bad quality. I have to turn off the earphones and reconnect manually through bluetooth for my phone.It will also not automatically detect my laptop most of the time. I have to go into bluetooth settings on my laptop and unpair the headphones and then pair them again.

I’ll start by saying the price is definitely a good starting point for these but quality is not lacking for what you pay.I purchased these for my girlfriend and we spend a lot of time in the gym needless to say these outlasted some Samsung’s I purchased that died after one day of use.Something I loved and so did she was the accessories the carrying case, and something that surprised us was when we connected it to her iPhone 8plus where the Bluetooth icon was it became a battery indicator.I recommend these for the quality, comfort, the price and the accessories soon I might be buying a second pair so I can replace my Samsung gear circle.

Good Cheap Bluetooth Headphones


I've had these for a couple of weeks. The company is very responsive. They sent me an email immediately after I received them wanting to know how I liked them and to reach out for any follow-ups (for $30 headphones I was impressed). I've paired them with my Apple Watch and iPhone 7 and it seems to work well. No complaints so far. Will take a little to get use to the wrap around earphones if you haven't wore them before, but overall they are snug and stay put. I've ran with them and mowed the yard and they stayed in fine. When I'm at work (since they fit snug in your ear) it blocks out noise so I can't hear my coworkers, so I miss requests I would normally hear with the Apple headphones. No complaining though, some times they need to be tuned out! Overall, I would recommend to a friend and my wife is thinking of getting some.

Don't Work with all Ears


I ended up not using these since they fall out of my ears easily. I've used other pairs of over-ear headphones, and the backs of these just don't hold them down like others I've used. I typically have trouble with in-ear headphones (except for Apple's earbuds, which work for me) While these do have an over-ear portion, they seem built to work primarily as in-ear headphones.I'm giving it three stars because although the headphones didn't work for my ears, the functionality of them worked great.

It is a bit of a distraction to have to keep adjusting them. With the bendable wires that shape how they are positioned, they don't stay in place and need to be occasionally repositioned.

good, just not great


i've only used these a few hours on the treadmill, but i like them so far. the ""wrap-around"" piece is flimsy, which is good. my previous pair were flexible, but stiff and were sometimes NOT comfortable. these allow the piece to just hang over the ear and the bud piece stays put with a good seal. volume can get loud. i'm not an audiophile, so i can't really comment on the quality, but i have no complaints. the connecting wire is flat and doesn't gather on one side and pull at your ear if you turn your head like a previous paid did. so far, my one complaint is the power button is on the side instead of top or bottom. you're shoving the bud into your ear to power on/off....not exactly pleasant.i do like the hard sided carry case that's included, keeps them from getting crushed in the gym bag.

These are perfect! The sound quality is great


Purchased these headphones mainly for mowing lawn and to listen to while I do woodworking.  Headphones I've purchased in the past never had a battery life to last very long.  These are perfect!  The sound quality is great, I don't need to turn the volume up very loud to hear music over the lawn mower or any of my power tools.  They are very comfortable, I hardly even notice they are there.  Only used them a few times to answer calls and have worked like a charm.  I'm not sure how long exactly the batteries last, but I have listened to music for AT LEAST 6 hours on them with no problem while mowing.  And with dust, dirt and anything else flying through the air, they have held up great and have no problem keeping them in my ears.  They have also worked great for keeping all of the dust and dirt out of my inner ear.  For the price, you will not find a better wireless headphone.

I ordered a pair of these back in October 2017. Now they won’t turn on at all. They’re fully charged and I’ve tried resetting them to the factory setting. Nothing. I loved them so much cause it’s hard to find anything to fit my small ears. So I ordered another pair. NOT THE SAME AND FALSE ADVERTISING!!! They changed the earpiece so it’s not flexible. It’s just a piece or rubber plastic and doesn’t custom fit to your ear. It’s waaayyy to big and the loop barely even touches the top of my ear loop with no way of moving it down. Soooo disappointed.

Not understanding all the good reviews


I bought a pair of these for a friend last year and she liked them a lot. So, when it was time for me to buy a new pair, I got a set for myself. From day one I have been disappointed with them. The design of the buds causes a great deal of wind sound when running with them, the do not stay seated in my ears, and the sound quality is very comparable to an AM radio. Additionally, there is no meter to let you know how much battery life is remaining. I wanted to like them, but I have actually given up on them and bought a different brand.

If you are looking for a cheap pair of Bluetooth ...


If you are looking for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earbuds to get the job done then these will work. They are not high quality in sound by any means so if you are an audiophile move along but I would imagine you wouldn't be looking here anyways. For me, there is way too much bass and not enough clarity. They do however get very loud and block out exterior noise. For the price, they are worth it but I already have a pair of Jaybirds that I will stick with for now.

2 months old and not working


I bought a pair of these headphones at the end of May and after only having them for 2 months they no longer hold any charge.  The sound would crackle and the they would disconnect and reconnect.  The voice of the lady saying that you are connected gets old after a while.  When they worked they sounded really good and I enjoyed using them.  As I read other reviews I have noticed that others have had the same problem.  On one of the reviews the manufacturer indicated that the person who bought them got a defective product.  I would get another pair but am really worried that I might have similar issues with the new pair seeing this is not an isolated incident.  If you get a pair that will work for longer than 2 months you would be happy with them.  Just hope the hold up.

and the sound quality (particularly the base) is surprisingly good. I’ve been so happy with them


The Samsung Gear IconX Cordfree Fitness Earbuds (given to me by my wife is a present)kept dropping out while I was working out. So, I decided to buy the Senso Bluetooth headphones to see if they would do the same thing. Because they were not particularly expensive, I figured it was worth a try.In fact, there has been no dropping out with the Senso Bluetooth headphones. The “signal” is strong, and the sound quality (particularly the base) is surprisingly good. I’ve been so happy with them, that I’ve returned the Samsung earbuds. A really great product at a reasonable price.Amazon, to its credit, agreed to take back the Samsung earbuds.

I needed a way to listen to calls, music, and videos while still being around other people and noises.  The SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones work great.  I am able to sync them easily to my ipad and iphone and I can move about easily.  The range is a lot farther than I would have thought...I can walk to other rooms at home or in the office and stay connected.  I can watch TV and still listen to football games or music...at the same time!  I think I will purchase sets for my sons as Christmas gifts!

Almost as good as Beats for a fraction of the price


I’ve purchased 3 pairs of the Senso headphones. They are comparable to the more expensive brand headphones. They all seem to last for about 1 year (I use them 6 times a week at the gym and when mowing my grass so combined use of about 10 hours a week). If something happens within the first year you just have to call them and they will send you a new one (I have had that happen twice). Before the Senso headphones I had several pairs of Beats. While sound quality may be slightly better it’s not enough to for the price difference. The beats only lasted me 1 year as well and they died as well. I would recommend to everyone (and have) to get these headphones. So much cheaper and similar quality as the Beats.

Doesn't work well with glasses.


I didn't care for these headphones. They are way too bulky. The sound quality was really good but not much bass in my opinion. I wear glasses everyday so the ear hook thing didn't work well for me. It was hard to get the bud in my ear and if I only wanted to wear one bud while at work, the other bud was too large to slip under the neck of my shirt. I'm returning mine for a different brand that's cheaper and smaller.

I really like these earbuds


I really like these earbuds. Connection with my phone and tablet has been seamless, unlike some other Bluetooth devices I’ve used. They sound good, and have plenty of volume available, and they are relatively comfortable and don’t fall out of my ears.  I had hoped that I could get a little more bass volume, as I play bass and usually listen to music with the objective of learning the bass line. To be fair, I have not heard many in ear type phones less than $100 that are able to produce strong and undistorted bass.Overall I am very happy with this product.

I needed a pair of inexpensive waterproof Bluetooth buds so I could listen to music in my hot tub and hear the music over the jets and not aggregate my neighbors with my choices of music late at night.  These are perfect and will serve my needs. Sound quality is very good, obviously not like my Bose headphones, but my Bose can not accompany me in the hot tub.  Ccol additional goodies that came with,  3 pair of ear tips so you get that perfect fit, obviously the charging usb cord, since little carrying case, a wire tie, a cellphone card wallet and last but not least a magnetic cellphone car vent mount.

Don't buy it! Broke immediately out of box!


The only reason I am giving this product one star is because I can't give it any less. The carelessness of the seller is beyond anything I've seen. I took these out of the box and tried listening to them, and when I tried changing the volume it crashed and stopped working. I thought charging it would help, but it would intermittently lose contact and stop charging. It went straight to the garbage can, didn't even bother wasting my time returning it. For anyone considering, buying, think twice. I've had my fair share of experience with cheap Bluetooth headphones and I can guarantee you at this price it is far better to get wired headphones.

They work but I'm not a big fan of the in-ear headset because after a while it bugs me personally. I can only wear them for a short time before I get irritated by them.

Blocks out loud gym douchebags


One week in and I really like these. I purchased after conducting a simple search for good headphones for the gym. My gym has made the terrible decision to lease out some of its floor space to a sort of boot camp training class. The boot camp people, especially the ""trainer"" really want everyone to know they are working out so they have to pound things and grunt and play their little Bose system on high to make sure they get everyone's attention (""Look at me! I'm working out harder than you because I'm throwing a ball against the wall over and over! Hear how loud it can be!"") So, I got these Senso headphone in hopes that they would:  1. Play my apple music louder than previous headphones; 2. Block out the ambient noise of the boot camp douchebags. They have worked to great success. My music plays louder and the buds fit snugglly-enough to block out the bootcamp and best of all, while running on the treadmill, I'm not constantly adjusting the buds so they don't fall out. This was the main reason I bailed on my Bose ear buds years ago.  For a fraction of the price, the Senso headphones are way better.

I read that the part that goes over your ear is a bit lose (there isn't a wire that makes it able to bend to the shape of your ear), so I was worried they wouldn't stay on my ears securely and would fall out while I jog, which is the problem I have with most headphones. I worried needlessly - I've jogged 4 miles a day for the past 3 days, and these were great! The sound is good, the buttons work, they stay on. Thumbs up.

Updated Review


I bought these a couple of years ago and was seriously impressed with the value for money. Sadly I lost my pair and had to get some new ones. The updated version has inflexible rubber bands that are hard to wrap around your ears, they sit uncomfortably around the ear and don't feel secure. The sound quality is not as good and the on/off message isn't as clear. Very disappointed. The original headphones were superior.

Great little headphones that lasted over 2 years


I've been using these almost daily since April 2017 with no problems until recently. Now when I move my head from side to side the sound comes and goes and seems to shift from one earbud to the next.  Up until the last week they were consistent and worked perfectly on my android phone and ipod.

They are too loud


My biggest problem with these is that they are FAR TOO LOUD. I've never used them on any setting above the absolute lowest, because even there they hurt my ears after just a few minutes. I've ended up wearing them with the actual ear buds outside my ear and to the side a little bit, which at least is made possible by the ear hooks. They're comfortable, and the buttons work well. I just wish there was any possible way to make them softer in volume.

Decent headphones


I use these for the gym or a long phone call, they work well.  Audio is decent enough to enjoy.  Bass could be better, but these aren't Beats and the price is perfect for what they are and what they do.  I enjoy em.  Battery lasts for about a weeks worth of gym visits, charges quickly, and when the battery is low while your listening to music, a low battery alert will be told to you.  Comfortable while running, lifting, walking, sitting, laying, etc.

Quality has gone down hill


I bought these a couple of years ago and they were decent headphones for a short jog or to listen to podcasts while working around the house. They stopped taking a charge so I bought new ones. New ones are much worse. Maybe they changed the manufacturer? Worse sound quality, terrible balance, shorter bluetooth range, and the plastic feels chintzier.

Poor connectivity.


After my previous Bluetooth ear buds failed, I thought I would go for this seemingly more popular design. Unfortunately it has worse reception (listening with my phone in my back pocket leads to stuttering audio).Also unlike my previous set when not it use it has a tendency to fall off your neck (my previous versions had a solid half circle in which the ear buds where magnetically linked onto)Won't be going back to this design of I have an opportunity next time.

Comfortable. I have tried 2 other brands and I kept getting sores in my ears.  They stay in you ear well. Would be better with a clip to clip to your clothing. I am a nurse and can only have one ear bud in. When I turn my head the other ear bud gets caught and doesn't come with me. They last a really long time. Great acessorie's that come with it. Especially like the carrying case with a separate pocket for the extra ear buds. It's not huge but big enough to put the small charger in. Happy with these so far.

Incredibly great customer service


I purchased these headphones close to a year ago.  They worked fine but just a few weeks ago one of the headsets lost sound.  I was going to give up on the item and throw them away when I remembered about the 1 year warranty.  I figured it was a long shot and there would be resistance to honoring it but was pleasantly surprised by the Senso response to the claim.  I went to their site and filled out the information on the item.  I shortly got an email on how to do a hard reset to see if it would bring the sound back to the ear piece.  It did not, so I responded back to them the following day, as encouraged if it did not work.  They advised a new pair would be shipped out.  My claim started on Wed and I had a new pair by Saturday.  Best service I seen to date on a warranty issue from any company.  I would not hesitate to purchasing another pair.

I am so glad I decided to purchase these Bluetooth headphones


I am so glad I decided to purchase these Bluetooth headphones. At first, I was worried about paying so much and then having to return them, but these things are worth so much more. I needed a pair of headphones or Bluetooth that I could turn on and off easily. The multifunction button on the right ear bud made it easy for me, despite my disability. I also thought they might be uncomfortable to where, but again, I was wrong. They are so much more comfortable that I was expecting. Not to mention, these things don't seem to budge once they are in.I also love that I was able to switch between my cell phone and my laptop without needing to put in a new set of headphones. I will definitely order these headphones again, just to have a backup pair.

I noticed there was an issue when the music sounded distorted at a low volume. Who ever tuned these earbuds cranked the bass to 11 without regard to how distorted it would make the music. I picked these up hoping I could use them for working out but can’t hear the music through the distortion caused by the poor tuning. Even EQing my phone didn’t help with the distortion problem. This purchase was a waste of money.

My main concern in earbuds is how comfortable they are with secondary focus on how well they sound and stay put. These earbuds are very comfortable and the over-ear hook keeps them in place when I run. The sound is good as well. I'm not an audiophile and have no idea how well it sounds at that level, but for my little daily workout, they sound just fine.These earbuds are wireless Bluetooth as well and were fairly easy to pair with my phone. The instructions were simple and easy to follow (which is good for me 😄).Included with the earbuds are a carrying case, multiple ear cushion thingy-s (for various sized ears), 2 charge cords, and a car adapter. One of the charge cords can become either a micro USB (for the earbuds) or a lightning port (for an iPhone) - so if you charge these two devices in the same place in your house, you won't need two different cords. It was an unexpected nice bonus.

Nice fitting, comfortable, noise cancelling buds


UPDATE: After wearing these for a couple of weeks I've gone back to using my over the ear noise canceling headphones...  The noise canceling is weak at best.  I love the controls, but I have to say the most disappointing aspect is signal interference.  Before buying these I had a set TAOTRONICS canceling buds, the noise canceling was great and the bluetooth signal was strong and I don't ever recall anything interrupting the signal.  I had to replace them after damaging them while wearing the stiff cable in front rather than across my neck.With these senso's using a Stihl trimmer if I got the trimmer near the phone the signal would cut out, it was also interrupted when I was walking by my electric fence after trimming the fence line.  Further if you lie the phone down and walk away and no lie turn your head the signal will cut out.  Once I find a new alternative I will give these to one of my children...FIRST POST: Fast shipping, nice packaging and accessories.  Nice fitting, comfortable buds.  Cable is light and soft and not noisy compared to other wireless buds I've had.  Range is lacking and the Bluetooth signal can be completely blocked at approximately 10'-15' with nothing more than the turn of your head.  This is very disappointing personally.  Noise cancellation is good considering they are buds. I would recommend these but don't wander far from the broadcasting device.

This is my second pair after the first set stopped working after a year.  This set reluctantly connects and then will drop the connection during various activities.  Apparently, I just ran out of support for this item even though it is only a few months old.  I will be looking for an alternative to these for my next set.  Even though they are inexpensive, they should still work.  I am also looking to process a refund or a replacement under the warranty provisions and will update if/when that occurs.

Amazing and quick service!


I did buy them around May and they were working perfectly  with an amazing sound until just a week ago when I started having issues with the left earphone, losing the sound, it looked like a contact or something. I wrote the seller and an hour later Kimberly Pollak wrote me back with the instructions step by step how to fix the issue. Now they work like NEW!! The funny thing is that when they started giving me issues I though they were just another piece of... Well, I can say now confidently is that they are built to last and that the seller really cares to offer an AWESOME service!

Fabulous set of Bluetooth Headphones!


Great, absolutely FABULOUS product.  I have spent over 200$ looking for a good set of Bluetooth headphones.  I finally found them in this SENSO product.  I highly recommend them to anyone....and the best part is I can wear them in the pool where I can walk with my bum knee and bad back.  These headphones sound great which is very important when you want to take your mind off of boring exercises.  Fast delivery too! Yep, get them!

Awesome!


I'm incredibly impressed by these, I was wary because I don't normally spend $30 on items like this. However, the call quality was great and the bass is amazing! I had zero issues connecting my bluetooth, and the battery life is really good as well. It came with 2 usb cables (3ft and a few inches) and a usb connector for the car, and a cool little zip up case to keep it all together. Well worth the purchase!

sound quality is good as is battery life


I purchased these for work. I work in a fairly noisy environment. I’ve used these 6 to 8 hours a day for the past three days, sound quality is good as is battery life. I have Bose at home and in comparison these do well. In a world where your expensive earbuds / headphones could get trashed easily, these are a great alternative. I definitely recommend them.

The sound quality is fantastic. Very good bass and range of volume. Maybe I got a bad pair but the Bluetooth range is just awful...being nice. Godforbide i have my phone in my pocket and turn my head, it disconnects every time. It only works if I'm standing still holding it level with my earbuds. If the Bluetooth signal actually worked, this would be been the best purchase and full 5 star.

Excellent as workout headphones


I use these headphones to work out. I have zero issues connecting (unlike some I've had in the past). The sound is actually quite good -- once you get them on correctly (and that wasn't super easy to figure out for me -- I suppose some people it would be no problem.). It's not noise cancelling, but I am amazed at how much it does cancel, and still keep me aware of what's going on around me during workouts. They are not the ones  want for really getting into my music, but they are perfect for working out.

They are becoming essential


These are quickly becoming my go to headphones for my iPad. The price is great and I love that it came with various earpieces, case, car charger, and lightning/mini usb charging cable. They stay on extremely well while I’m working out and most people just assume they’re Beats. The only thing keeping them from being 5 stars is that there is slight feedback when they are turned on and nothing is playing.

Comfortable, great sound, slightly big


These are handy, easy to use, have great sound, and resist sweat. I use them to exercise outside in hot, humid, San Antonio, TX, and I have long hair - so they get WET - and keep on going. The only con is that I am petite, with a narrow face, small hat size, and small ears, so these are a little big for me, but the over the ear portion keeps them on and is comfortable, so it is ok. If you are not petite, these will probably fit perfectly.

Best $40 spent in a longtime...


First of all, I would like to thank all of the Amazon users who left feedback on these headphones.  Had I not read their feedback, I would have been too skeptical because of the low price point.  These are perfect and stay in my ear at the gym.  I know some users complained about the telephone static on phone calls but, I don't answer calls while working out so save a few hundred bucks by ordering these headphones.

Fantastic product & fabulous customer service.


I was going to get Apple AirPods, but fear losing one or both. With the Senso connected together they are more secure & less loseable. Sound is LOUD. Much louder than my Apple ear buds with or without Bluetooth adapter. Battery life is great. And they reach out to you TWICE before the first week to make sure you're satisfied. I'm buying another as a backup to use while the other one is charging. I use them about 12-14 hours per day.

These headphones sound great for ear buds


These headphones sound great for ear buds. they have great bass and highs. If you want an eclectic sound system for your ears while you work out, you  may look elsewhere. The dollar spent value for return is very very good. To get that high end sound, you'll need to spend a few hundred dollars for the same performance it was designed to do while you are working out. Highly recommended.

Worst headphones I have bought in my life.


The sound quality was like static. Contacted the company to let them know, and they said that maybe it will work better with more use. Then they stopped working all together. All within two months.Update, 1/15/20:After being contacted by SENSO here on amazon, I spent the last few weeks having an email back-and-forth with them, they ultimately gave me a 5% off code if I want to purchase something again. Spoiler, I won't.

The fidelity has been surprisingly good, given the price and I am glad I ...


I bought these to use with my new iPhone 7 Plus. The lack of a headphone jack really made going wireless a requirement for my wife and I as we use our phones for both music and Audible, quite a bit. One of the deciding factors in this headset was the battery life and price. While I can listen to Audible through my car on my way to and from work, while I am at work I need headphones and these last me all day. Having two cords means I have one at home next to my bed to charge the ear buds overnight and one at work to charge them should I know I'm going to not be using them for awhile, such as when I have meetings.The fidelity has been surprisingly good, given the price and I am glad I got these.

They work fine when I am just sitting stationery


I got these for Christmas because I needed a pair of bluetooth headphones for when I go on my runs. When I saw them on buzzfeed and various other websites, I decided to give them a shot. They work fine when I am just sitting stationery, but when I use them while running, they fall out of my ears within 10 minutes of my starting. After 30 minutes of putting them back into my ears every so often, the sound quality gets a little weird and fuzzy even if my phone is less than a foot away and they are fully charged. The hooks are way too long for my ears, and the earbud itself is also too big. I do not recommend these for anyone with small-ish ears, but if you have normal sized or larger ears, these are a good quality lower price option

I wanted some bluetooth ear buds so I could get rid of the cord. I listen to audio books while working in the shop and the a dangling cord gets in the way.These ear buds work great. The  connected to my phone with no problem.I like the voice that tells you if they are on or off, no guessing if you hit the button right.Added plus was they have a built in mic. I must have missed that in the ad.With the mic, I can answer the phoneGreat ear buds.

Bad battery life, ok music quality.


I use these headphones almost everyday. They are not even a year old yet and the battery life is TERRIBLE. I don't know if I got a bad pair or something, but if I don't charge them the same day they're more than likely going to die on me the next day I use them. I don't even turn up the volume very high. It's usually very low.Other than the battery, nothing else is too terrible. I think the worst part next to the battery is the cord holding them. They get caught/tangled up in my hair so easily it's annoying. If you have long hair, watch out.The sound is alright, it's not amazing but it's not bad. Definitely does not have any noise cancelation at the level I listen to, but I listen to them really low.The plastic for the ears isn't too bad, they don't seem to bother my ears. I wear glasses.

Defective. Did not play more than a few seconds before cutting out constantly. Not worth the $20.


They simply did not work for exercise. They paired fine and I played a song through them and everything seemed ok. As soon as I tried to take them out on a run, they simply would not work. My phone was in my flip belt so it isn’t like it was too far away. Every other second, it would cut out. I thought it was a problem with my phone trying to connect to the wifi at my house but even well outside of that range, it was still spotty. I counted and the longest it continually stayed connected and played music was 6 seconds. Other than that it was like someone was changing the radio dial constantly. I’m returning them.

Broke after a month!


Great sound quality, paired easily with my devices, stayed in my ears without having to adjust them.  I put them in my purse and the next time I reached for them the right bud was broken. The control button for power came off and the tiny volumn button on top was detached as well. Very disappointed! The only other issue I had before they broke was they would randomly disconnect and the sound quality would come and go when connected to my computer.

Great Product....Great Customer Service....


Great product and great customer service! I use these headphones almost daily while at the gym and they work great. Even while running they have never fallen off and the earbud design keeps sweat out of my ear. I've been roughly 50 feet away from my phone and still had a crystal clear signal.When my first pair of headphones stopped working I contacted Senso and asked if any additional troubleshooting could be performed. The battery would charge although the headphones wouldn't turn on. Customer service got back to me within a couple of hours and instead of providing tips on how to fix they sent me a new pair of headphones!Overall a great product with top notch customer service. Will certainly buy another product of theirs!

Great headphones to buy!


I love these headphones. The price for them although more then some cheaper hearphones are well worth the price. I used about 5 different brands of headphones all bluetooth ranging price from $20-$40. Compared to the otherbrands these headphones sound great, a perfect if you run or workout a lot like I do, or are just wanting headphones that offer great range and distance to allow house work without having your phone in your pocket. The company overall has been great. They respond fast to emails and to help you out with any issues you may have like they did for me and will help you to the best of their ability which in working with sellers on Amazon or any company or place is great when you get customer service like they gave me.Overall I would get these headphones they're great and I even bought two pairs just to have one that is fully charges for work and working put.

Works well and with a couple tweaks, would be absolutely perfect


These earphones work well.  They are a bit uncomfortable at times with the ear tip that was on when they arrived, but there are other sizes provided so I'll have to figure out which one works best for me.  I also wish that the part that hooks on the back of the ear was a bit softer, but all in all, these work well and the sound is very good.  They synch easily with my iphone and I'm really glad I bought them.

Great Headphones for the price, but not the best mic.


After messing with these headphones, I have grown to love them! They fit perfectly, and the earbuds that they come with to help cancel out sound work really well considering that these are just earbuds. The sound quality is just what I need when listening to musing or games on my laptop. 9 out of 10 would recommend for the price. The only gripe I have with these headphones is the mic quality. Its not the best but is expected with the price.

Amazing Earbuds while they lasted


Best Earbuds I had ever owned until they stopped working properly. The right ear stopped playing ,music and the left cuts out from time to time.I'll admit I put them through a lot. I used them for several hours a day, at work, at the gym, and bike riding for miles on end,  they lasted a good 2 months of none stop playing until they finally gave in. They were great while they lasted but when I first got them I had few issues with the volume controls,or maybe the volume itself. I personally like my music at moderate volume not to high or low, but I every time I went passed 33% the volume went much higher than it actually displayed on my phone. I took as a sign that they had to be broken to get sound levels to adjust themselves and sure enough they did. Great pair of Bluetooth earbuds but maybe don't wear them athletically

As long I stay in the house or back yard (phone always on me) these are great. But in the front yard, they cut in a out constantly. I've done the factory reset and they still have issues when I'm in the front yard doing yard work. I don't know what in the front is interfering, but it's annoying. I reached out to SENSO and they have been nothing short of amazing in trying to fix this by sending me another set. Stuff happens and I'm glad they are taking care of it.

I would give it a 5 star but I can't seem to get the left earbud to stay in, no matter what size of earbud I use.  I got them for working out, so it was frustrating having to stop what I was doing to put the earbud back in, constantly.  It would be nice if the hooks that go over your ear would be adjustable so you can lock them into place better.  Other than that, the sound quality is great and I love having them.

Ball-o-mud artificially boosted bass mars otherwise good product


Bluetooth connectivity generally works very well, fits well enough, seems well-made, long battery life, intuitive and accessible controls, says in my ears even when mountain biking.  The big problem is the sound quality.  Like so many of these types of products, the bass is boosted artificially high, and not in a good way.  A bit of extra bass is fine IF it's tight, but this is muddy bass.  If you are listening to pop or basic rock I can see how these would sound fine.  If you listen to any kind of hard rock, metal, jazz, or other technical music, you end up with a ball of mud. Double-bass drum hits, muted riffs, or anything remotely fast that has some bass content will just flub out.  For me, wearing these while I bike or otherwise workout where there is extraneous noise anyway, I can deal with it just enough to tolerate it.  In isolation they sound like a big fat mess with a lot of music.  If you are an audiophile and like technical music, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

I just hooked this item up after a couple of months' wondering whether or not I'd give it as a holiday gift. I didn't realize what a good value this is: It contains everything you need for charging via wall charger or automobile, a total of three pairs of earplugs in sizes, and thorough instructions for set up and troubleshooting. Sound quality is fine for jogging or walking, though not ""audiophile"" quality. I would recommend this item!

Great quality for the price.


I just purchased the Senso S-250 runnibg and working out.  The $38 price on Amazon seemed very reasonable considering the IPX7 waterproof rating and the noise cancellation feature.  The earbuds arrived very well packaged complete with a hard case, 2 charging cables, 3 sets of eartips, and a duel port car charger.  A lot of stuff for the $$.  Now to performance.  These earbuds are are some of the most comfortable that I've ever used.  The soft over the ear silicone wings keep the buds securely in place when running which I love.  The controls and microphone are on the right earbud housing and they take a little getting used too.  The power/pause button is on the side of the earbud which is convenient but I found that I occasionally press it accidentally when adjusting the earbud position.  Not a big deal.  Overall the build quality is great although the sound quality is average.  Highs are tinny and the bass is muffling.  In generally the music is not super crisp but more than adequate for running and working out.  In all fairness I'm used to a pair of fairly expensive Shure wired earbuds that I travel with.  Again, probably not a fair comparison.  Bottom line:  I'd buy these earbuds again.

Bought one. Liked it. Then bought 3 more.


Only used them once so far just to see how they are, and they're good. Really nice sound. I'm totally happy with the value, price, and sound of it. I can't really hear the difference between these and the wireless Beats that I had on in Costco. A friend was here and listened also and he bought one out of my batch of 3 that I added on. I have one to my wife to use with her new iPhone 7plus instead of the $250 Apple Air buds. Works fine. And one more for a gift to someone down the road.

So far so good! I usually have the volume all the way up, or close to it, when running outside, but that’s just because I like my music loud to pump me up. No issues yet. Hopefully they don’t start to lose sound quality or volume like others have experienced! My ears are pretty small so the ear hooks are only somewhat effective, but I put a headband over them and they stay perfectly in place! Definitely better than traditional earbuds.

Second try was the charm, but otherwise seems a good value


The first unit went belly up after a few days. Customer service was quick in its response and a second pair was sent out within a day. This pair works reasonably well. I only use these headphones at the gym to listen to podcasts and watch videos while exercising. This hardly tests the sound quality, so all I can say is that the volume is adequate. The fit is fine in one ear, but not the other using the large ear bud. I'm in my 70s, so maybe it's the fault of my parts, not the headphones. The UI is kind of clumsy with one button doing all of the work, but maybe that's true of all wireless units.Seems at this point (about a month) to be a good value.

Great pair of wireless headphones that in my opinion are much better than the beats headphones that look like these.  The reason  I say this is that I bought a pair last year and spent the 150 dollars on them and had them break within two months of going to the gym everyday.  I looked after them as best I could and the only moisture that came in contact with them was sweat.  The same amount of fatigue was given to these headphones as well and they are still working very well.  The battery longevity is also better with these as well. I should also note that I am not a sound snob and cant tell you about the finer points on bass and etc.  I just use these everyday to listen to music for working out for at least an hour.

Also in the box you will find 2 different charging cord, an adapter for charging in your car, different sized ear tips and a very nice case to hold the earbuds and accessories. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear. The hooks that keep the earbuds securely in place are soft and don’t hurt my ears!

Good wireless headphones


Good wireless headphones. I did not like the fact that they do not seem to loop around the back of my ear very good, I think it should be adjustable. Also, the placement of the of and on button is awkward and I seem to always push it when I am trying to adjust my headphone on the right side, then it pauses anything I’m listening to. The sound is pretty decent. I really enjoyed all the extra accessories it came with.

I've used these for several hours now on the same battery. These headphonesAre Amazing! The buttons and mic work great with my iPhone, the sound is superb, they stay in your ear, and they were only 35 bucks! I'm ordering some for my wife. Work great for at the gym (sweatpproof) or as a handsfree. And they come with two different charge cables, car charger, a nifty case, and different sized ear tips. Did I mention that they're only $35?

So far I like the product


I recently received the SENSO Bluethooth headphones after shopping around and comparing several bluetooth headphones.  So far I like the product; good sound quality, and lightweight.  What I like about this specific headset is the bluetooth receiver is on the actual earpiece instead of the cord, like other headsets.  They are also very lightweight and don't dangle too much while running.  The only thing I have experienced so far is the headphones loosen up a bit while running.  I've tried using the different earbuds supplied, and seem to have the best luck with the red foam earbuds (they seem to create a better seal), but still feel a bit loose after a while.  The over-the-ear hooks will keep the headphones in place, so there is never a worry about falling out.  Overall, these bluetooth headphones are perfect for the price, and so far have held up pretty nicely.

This is the (last thank God) out of 4 attempts at buying good sounding, comfortable, durable, bluetooth buds! These have Great sound, they are comfy and stay in!! Yay Senso, yall knocked it out of the park!!Now 4 weeks later---- the only downsides are: the range.  seems to only be about 10', the 2nd thing is where the ""controls are ""plug-ins"" are.For those reasons, i gave 4 stars instead of my previous 5

Useless for workouts but good for work


I bought these to use for running, but they're basically useless for that since they won't stay in my ear. I tried the different sizes of silicone inserts, but they don't stay in well when you're moving and sweating. I've had cheap Panasonic and expensive Etymotic wired earbuds that stay in much better, so I know it's possible. However, they pair easily (with my Nexus 6) and have good sound quality and battery life, so I'm happy with them for indoor use.

Overall, these are pretty good Bluetooth earbuds.


TL:DR ReviewSound Quality: 4.9/5Comfort: 4/5Battery Life: 4.8/5-annoying buzzing noiseFull Review:I almost gave these Bluetooth earbuds a five-star rating. They sound quality is great if you are listening to music on anything above 20% of the maximum volume. When listening to anything lower than 20% max volume (podcasts, breaks between songs, soft songs), the left earbud will emit a pesky electric buzzing noise. The buzzing noise will overpower the sound of any soft music or podcast that you may be listening to. I would not recommend these for non-music purposes because of the buzzing noise. Also, I'd like to point out that the right earbud does not emit any buzzing noise whatsoever. The ear hooks are not adjustable and are too big for my ears, I typically let them dangle on the outside of my ears because of this.

Nice headphones with problems.


Very nice sound with this headphones but they do stick out on the side of your head if you are looking for the aesthetics as you are wearing them. I have had several issues with them losing signal with my phone in my back pocket and when I bend over. I had to do a factory reset but then it happened a second time as well. Definitely a great pair of headphones for the money.

I really like these wireless headphones


I really like these wireless headphones.  When I saw all the good reviews I decided to give them a try over some more expensive models.  Good decision.  First off, they are plenty loud with my Android phone.  Second, the fidelity is pretty excellent.  They are replacing a decent pair of wired Sony headphones.  They stay in my ear nicely, which is always a problem for me.  They have 4 different kind of buds for different size ears.

Sound pretty darn good!


These are very comfortable to wear and sound just fine.  Hey - they are ear buds - so I was surprised at how good they sound.  I am not an audiophile, but I know what sounds good, and these do.  I use them to listen to music on my iPhone while I am mowing - they seem to block outside noise pretty well.  They are very comfortable and lightweight.  I would buy another set should something go wrong with these after the warranty period.

Surprisingly awesome


These headphones are incredible. This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and I have always been skeptical of what the sound quality would be like on Bluetooth. These headphones are SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive than my BOSE headphones (which are not wireless) and the sound quality is just as good if not better. They are truly noise cancelling and the ability to control the music from the earpiece is fantastic. This is the best purchase I've made in a long time and I would highly recommend them to anyone.

For example, the case it comes with is very nice and sturdy, it fits into my purse well and it has tons of charger adapters and 3 spare sets of  ear buds. The instruction manual was clear and easy to follow. Best of all, the the sound quality and reception around the house is excellent.  Thank you!

I got these earbuds for my boyfriend to use at the gym because the music they play there isn't his favorite and like most people good music motivates him to work out harder and longer.  He loves these and is so happy he isn't dealing with the cord being ripped out of his phone and having to plug it back in.  The battery lasts a long time and once it runs out it charges up pretty quick, too.  Two satisfied customers here.

Not picking up reception


I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to using these headphones during my workouts because I wanted hands free where I could place my phone in a location and walk around ""at least"" 3-4 feet away and still get the reception I need to listen to my music. But it seems like when I turn my head to the left or to the right while working out I lose reception.  If I have my phone in my hand and start walking I lose reception.  I could be sitting at  machine at the gym and the phone is on the floor, and I would lose reception.  I'm having to place the my phone inside my sports bra to be able to get the reception I need when listening to music while running on treadmill or working out.After reading all the reviews I was excited, and there are a lot of reviews on here.  So I'm not sure if this is a defect or if anyone else is experiencing the same thing?

Lightweight, comfortable, sounds good.Have been told that the microphone doesn't sound that great by some others.A little hard to operate just because they don't have many visual indicators.They can pair with other devices and start beeping when you get out of range, so operation can be a little tricky.But for what I wanted: they do the job well and I'm glad I bought them.

I, just like thousands of you read the reviews and made your decision based on your reviews you had read. Well I'm really glad I bought these Headphones. They work great. The range is really awesome. I was outside and my phone was inside and I was about 35' away. Inside my home the range is even greater. I'm just going to sum it up like this... Great product, works and sounds great and it's over half the cost of  headphones that my wife bought. So it's win, win win for me.. Buy them and don't spend $200 on Beats.

Great Customer Service


The SENSO bluetooth headphones have made exercising a lot more comfortable. I used to get annoyed by having wired headphones bounce around and snag on things when I was running, but the bluetooth earbuds work great and I rarely have to fiddle with them in the middle of a workout. Unfortunately my first pair suddenly stopped working after about 4 months so I contacted SENSO's customer service reps and they were very helpful. They responded to my email in under 2 hours and gave me a few things to try to get the earbuds working again. It turns out they were a defective pair and SENSO let me know they'd send me a new pair right away as the earbuds come with a one-year warranty. I'm excited to get my new pair of earbuds and hope the replacements work well.

Second set of Senso headphones that stopped working within a few months


I previously owned an older set/model of Senso headphones that lasted about 2.5 years. Once they stopped working, I decided to buy another pair of Senso headphones since I liked my old ones. However, this new pair is much larger in sizing with regard to the part that wraps around the ear lobe. So, it is much harder for these headphones to stay on my ears while I am running. This second set stopped working after 6 months.

Don't stay in


I bought these because I really wanted something that would stay firmly in my ears while working out. They don't. It's nice that they come with three sizes of bud covers, but they aren't grippy. The loop over the ear is *huge* and doesn't actually even rest on my ear. I might cut them off. They just add more weight that pulls the buds out of my ears. Last, the sound quality would be pretty good if they stayed in, but when they hang halfway out you don't get very good sound. Disappointed.

We just received them, and so far we have been really pleased.  Everything has exceeded expectations- the accessories that come with the product are much more than they even advertise.  The buds themselves are extremely high quality.  For the price, as compared with other market offerings, they are an incredible value.  I guess you never know how well a product will hold up until you've had it a while.  But these seem to be everything that is promised, and much more.  I'm going to buy another pair.

Definitely worth the price. HD sound, loud speakers, a company worth supporting


Fantastic headphones, great sound quality, and awesome customer service from the company. I am totally satisfied with both Senso as a company, and with the earbuds I got from them recently as a gift. The first pair I received seemed to have a slight buzzing noise coming from one earbud, which I thought was odd but perhaps normal. I emailed the Senso support team anyways, and was guided through a couple small self-repair steps before determining it must be a manufacturer issue. I sent them back and just received my replacement pair a couple of days ago. They work fantastic, there's no more buzzing, and the sound is loud and true. I really like the construction, as well. It's only plastic, but it feels lightweight on the ears, and like it would be comfortable to wear for many hours of listening.I would definitely recommend these for anyone in need of some great-sounding, solid earbuds. Also, shout out to Kimberly Pollak of the support staff: you rock.

Solid Product - Solid Customer Service!


Solid headphones!  But so was the customer service!  I've had the headphones for about 10 months and they've been very durable. I must admit, I'm probably hard on them in the gym.  For example the cord might get pulled when I have a barbell on my back doing squats, as sometimes I forget to flip the cord around to the front.  Not sure if that was the reason they were malfunctioning, but at some point one of the speakers wasn't working properly with the sound going off and on whenever the cord moved.  Senso crushed it with their customer service though.  Kimberly asked me to do a factory reset.  That didn't work.  She immediately apologized and shipped me a new set of headphones which are now on the way, since I've had them for about 10 months and they are under warranty for 1 year.  But just to be safe with my new set, I'll try to remember better to flip the cord around to the front when I put a heavy barbell on my back.  So even if you're really tough on them in the gym, Senso has got your back!Thank you Kimberly and Senso!

Have been using these headphones for about a month. They work as advertised and look very robust. I get about 4 hours of steady TV watching on from a full battery charge. Would give these headphones Five Stars if the ear-loops could be removed because my family tells me that they look bulky when I wear them at home.

Amazing customer service and great headphones overall!


I bought the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones August 2017 and I use them on a regular basis at the gym and at work. They hold a charge for around 5-10 hours (hard to say exactly, but I usually use them for an hour and a half a day and charge them a couple of times a week), they are comfortable to wear, and they stay put even when I'm running and jumping and sweating heavily. Sound is good in my opinion as well, they cancel out a lot of outside noise, they were easy to pair with my phone, and I can walk into another room away from my phone and they still connect with no problems. But honestly, the best part about them is the customer service. I was caught in a heavy rainstorm during my run this weekend and one of the ears lost most of its sound. I emailed customer service and they were very responsive. They gave me a couple of solutions to try, and then sent me a new pair, free of charge, all within a 24 hour period. Thanks again SENSO!

Not too bad but has a short battery life and ok sound.


I do like that these are wireless and still stay in place when i run. They last maybe 4 hours on a charge which is a trip and a half to the gym for me so i have to charge after every use. They are a little clunky on your ears but not uncomfortable.  The sound is weird. It seems to be louder and clearer from the left side than the right side. Its not a deal breaker, just unfortunate.

Update: 2 months later they don't even work anymore.These came in 6 days ago. Took them out, they looked great. Made sure they were fully charged and started using them the next day. First thing I noticed was the sound quality was a little off. Any music with bass sounded awful. Today, 6 days in, I get a “power low” notification. I check and it’s at 30%. A minute later they shut off. I turn them back on, still at 30%. Shortly after get power low notification and they shut off again. Would not recommend these headphones.

When you get your headphones, replace the red sponges  (shown on the right), with one of the three pairs of ear cushions (shown on the left). Attach the small, round, black wire tie to create an adjustment loop in the middle of the cable. Also note the location of the charging port on the right ear piece.

Great first 3 months, now won't turn on


This is my second pair of Senso wireless headphones. The first pair I had lasted quite awhile but unfortunately I lost them. I ordered a new pair in May and they worked fine until the last few weeks (August). They started randomly turning off while I was using them (no warning whatsoever). Sometimes I'd be able to turn them back on but usually they wouldn't connect to my phone after that. In the last week they won't turn on at all. I can see that I have a full charge and have tried a factory reset to no avail.

I do like them, they are a much more affordable alternative to the Beats but they have room for improvement. For almost $40 they aren’t bad at all. My biggest complaint is the calling feature, whenever I call someone they can’t hear me and I’m on the phone A LOT. They could also use an eq feature too, I looked in the manual for anything pertaining to the audio and found nothing...so I’m giving them 3 stars.

Great headphones.  I already used them at gym and there excellent.  It has hardly any inner echo . What I mean is like hearing ur heart beat or when u move them around u hear all the inner movement in ear. 1 important thing is u need to use ur music players eq to adjust sound quality.  If not everything will sound flat. Great way to save money and still have good sounding product. The scale of 1 to 10 . I give a 7..

I only had for a few days but shipping was fast and senso was very involved in the purchase. They emailed me to make sure all was ok and how my purchase was. I recommend the product as of now due to only using for a few days. They are well worth the money and I was happy to order from senso. I would order from them again with no question.Update haven't used for a while but won't charge didn't use very much. Probably wouldn't buy again because they didn't last.

Frequently unpairing and repairing


CONSThey are constantly unpairing and repairing, so you miss sound and get the obnoxious “pairing” voice all the time. The microphone quality is poor - it sounds like you’re in a cave. They are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. My husband refuses to wear them, they are so uncomfortable.PROSThey stay in your ears even when upside down in a yoga pose. The sound quality is good. They hold a charge.

Great headphones!!


Great price for what you get! I love how these come with multiple size buds, a car charger, multiple charging cables and the headphones themselves are made very well.  They work great too! I have very sensitive ears and even wearing glasses hurt, so I was nervous how these would feel.  Because they are made of silicone, they don't hurt the top of my ear.  They hold in place very well and the sound is awesome.  I bought two of these for my husband and I.

Happy happy happy


This is my first ever wireless headphone device. I used them for the first time today and am VERY happy I purchased.I noticed I can walk about 2-3ft away from my phone before the “signal” gets staticky. I’m not electronically savvy and I had no issue connecting the ear buds to my phone.... however I can’t figure out how to turn it off so my phone doesn’t always go to Bluetooth lol

Good quality cheap, no complaints for headphones


The Bluetooth headphones are comfortable and profide a pretty good sound quality given its price. Should anything ever happen I would definitely buy another one. It also comes with a magnetic adhesive metal plate to connect to your phone and a fan magnetic thing to connect to your fan so your phone would hold up.My only issue with it is that after a day or two of using the adhesive metal plate it came completely off my phone case and didn't work anymore as the adhesive didn't maintain the amount of sticky ess as initially

Incessant Beeping and Unbearably Loud


They pair easily and stay on my head, and the sound quality is decent. The negatives are even the lowest volume setting is very loud, the design hurts my ears, on the lowest setting text tones and keyboard sounds are unbearablly loud, and there is this incessant beeping that occurs when switching apps, sending messages, and randomly that replaces normal audio feedback. I will not be keeping these.

Excellent product. The buds fit smoothly and stay put even while running.  The outer ear holders are barely noticeable, very comfortable and do their job perfectly.  BT range is as advertised and no drops or skips.  Controls are adequate and function well. Sound is good, not excellent but good and for BT, that is itself an accomplishment.  Extremely happy with this purchase.  Might just order another one as a spare or for work.

Undervalued! Great product and better price.


These are steal for just over $30. After doing my review research via Amazon and YouTube I was convinced. I am very satisfied with the headphones now that I have them. I actually very impressed with the quality of the earphones themselves. The most important, the sound is great. I'm an audio tech for my church's AV team and these get my stamp of approval. They are very comfortable to wear. They hold very well in the ear. The noise cancellation works well too. Talked on the phone with my wife she said she could hear good and she sounded pretty clear too.  Amazon's shipping was super fast. I chose 2 day shipping and I got it the next day. Overall it truly is a 5 star product and a 5 star service form Amazon.

A woman at the gym was wearing some bluetooth Beats headphones, which she said cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $150! I hopped on Amazon and found these at a fraction of the price. I'm super happy with them! The sound is good, they fit well and don't slide around, and the on-ear controls are very handy. I was really pleased that it came with multiple types of chargers. This is a great value! Highly recommended!

Great price for good wireless headphones


I am enjoying my new headphones, bought a pair for me and my wife as we wanted to have hands-free music while we ran and rode bicycles. These headphones provide great sound and at the greatly reduced price are a good value. They are a bit bulky and I am still learning to connect and disconnect to Bluetooth conveniently. Thus far I have to go into my phone to disconnect or cannot return to normal sound/audio on my phone when I'm not using the headphones. Further,  it is easy to turn the headphones off while pushing the earbud further into the year, I keep forgetting that the red button on the outside will turn the headphones off.

Sound great


I've had these for about 6 months now. They work great once they're paired up with my Bluetooth device. However, therein lies the issue. They are very difficult to pair with my iPad. iPad says they're connected and the little voice in the ear piece says they're connected, but they're not. Only way to know for sure is if the little headset symbol is displayed in the upper right corner where the Bluetooth icon would be. I have to go through this pairing iteration several times before they actually ""pair."" Very disappointed

Meh....


Works well at the gym and around the house... there is ALOT of background noise when wearing outside and it's windy or when your running outside. You can't make a call by pressing the multi-function button. People can't hear me when trying to use the phone option unless I am indoors and in a quiet area. I wear glasses sometimes and the part that goes around your relationship isn't thin enough for the glasses and the headphones so they have to hang off the outside of my ears when wearing glasses. The good... well, the sound is decent... If you are looking for just something just to listen to music.. it might be for you... if you are looking for a product that does more, buy something else.

I LOVE these headphones!  I do have other wireless headsets, but the main one I was using naturally goes around the neck; well after wearing these in the gym for 2 hours then going to work and using them all day long while working that weight on your neck (even though ever so lightly) tends to weigh on me and eventually leading to a headache, neck ache that never really goes away everyday!  So this is a MAJOR PLUS for me because it feels like you don't even have these on!  Sound is great...would definitely recommend these - great price!

I've waited a year before posting a review. I've bought the same headphones 2 times and each time they stopped working before the year ended. The headphones pair easily and fit great but they just dont last. They work great at first but then the ears start to go out. I really liked them so I tried to buy the same ones a second time but ended up with the same issue 11 months later. For the money they are fine, just dont plan on them lasting a long time.

The sound is great. They work wirelessly with my phone. The ear piece that wraps over the ears is not adjustable and fits me a littlw big, but i ran with them on and they stayed in place. The piece that is used to tighten the cables behind the neck comes off easy and it is frustrating to put it back so i threw it out. Good for the price. They come in a nice small case and also comes with chargers.

Poor performance with iPhone 6


These headphones do not work at all with my iPhone 6. They pair.  But I have to hold the phone within an inch of the headphones. I like to keep phone in my back pocket when walking or working out. If I do that I lose contact with the headphones.  I will get music for one second and then static for two.  They are really irritating.

Comfortable, stay in my ears (which was a problem with other wireless headphones!), sound great, come with cute case and a lot of accessories. The pairing to my iPhone was simple and they charge very quickly. What a great deal! I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for comfortable wireless headphones that stay put. (Written in April 2017)UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW:It is now July 2018. I noticed that I was having more and more difficulty connecting to my iPhone and iPad; they finally stopped connecting completely. Too bad. They are comfortable and sound good. I guess at this price over a year's worth of use is not unacceptable, but I'll be shopping for another brand.

Easy to use & well designed


They are packaged extremely well and I really like how easy to use they are. I seem to have trouble keeping the left one in my ear, but perhaps I need to switch the size of earbud attachments. My only concern is that the User Guide says that I should have gotten a ""wire tie"" and I don't think that I did, unless I'm misunderstanding what it is. It looks like something that I would be able to wrap the earbuds around when placing in the case but I need them for traveling and running and don't feel like sending them back for that reason. Otherwise, so far, I really like them! (Have only used for music so far, no speaking on the phone).

After I received them the other day,I charged them up, easily paired them with my iPhone and wore them for 2 1/2 hours walking and listening to music.  I was surprised and how good the sound is!  I was also easily able to work all the buttons on the earpiece to answer the phone & talk which was another positive surprise.  Best of all after I figured out how to put them on correctly they stayed in comfortably and did not fall out!  Also I love the case that came with them and the directions are very clear and easy to follow. So I am very happy with this product.

Best value in earbuds I've seen in a while!!!


These earbuds are the best I've had in a while. They connect with ease to pretty much every Bluetooth enabled device and have continued working well after the time I've had them for. Most earbuds I've had in the past have broken withing a few weeks because I use them 24/7 but these are quite durable. The sound quality is pretty good, not perfect, but good enough for you to easily enjoy music without hearing flaws. the design is great and they stay perfectly on my ears. The case it comes with is really nice and also the extra ear pieces have proven really handy. The foam ear pieces have been my personal favorite. The ear pieces do not come off very easily and I've only lost one this far. All in all a great value for the price you pay!!!

Bad fit, not a good product.


I thought these sucked. The over-the-ear hook is way too large, and the only tips that will hold them somewhat in place are the foam tips - even then, if you sweat a little, they will work themselves out of your ears without much motion to help them. The sound quality is okay, but those two issues were dealbreakers for me. Look for something in the $40 range, and forget the over-the-ear hooks.

Just what I've been looking for: affordable, comfortable, stay-in-place, easy-to-use-and-adjust earbuds. Wireless, too. The sound is just fine. Not noise cancelling for those who need that but using the best size bud-cover for your ear helps diminish extraneous sound. Easy to pair with devices. Location of sound/track buttons very convenient. A nicely designed item tucked away in  a small but substantial round case.

I was so looking forward to new ear buds.


So far I like them. However I'm unsure if the concerns I'm about to mention are normal or if it's just my pair. The right ear bud gets very warm within the first 20 minutes of use also there is a small hum in the right side while playing. Additionally I believe the quality of the right side is not nearly as good as the left. Now they have been fully charged and within 2 hours have told me the battery is low. I do believe this pair is faulty. And I was so looking forward to a new pair of ear buds. I'm not a happy camper seeing as I got these days before I'm headed out of town and in desperate need of ear buds.

Cuts out constantly if you're actually doing any physical activity


Worked fine if I sat down and didn't move.  If I did anything other than that - like any type of physical activity - these would cut out constantly.  Super annoying - I mean unless you like your music starting and stopping every 10 seconds in a workout.  Maybe these will work for you if all you do is sit like some bro lifting weights and trying to hook up with fake blondes at the gym, but if you're actually doing any physical activity I'd suggest a better product.

I bought a pair for my son at college to replace his PowerBeats which got squished/broken in his gym bag.  He needed something to replace them, and I was looking for decent quality at a MUCH lower price- since the expensive originals didn't seem built to take much abuse.  He's had these for a couple of weeks now and reports that they are 'bad ass'.  Can't get much higher praise than that from a 20 year old.

I have normally hated earpods, but I really wanted to find a pair to make me like them. I have since loved these even though I have only been using them for about two weeks. Battery life is pretty long, I used them for an 8 hour shift at work and then some the next day before the Low Battery warning came up. I compared them to the beats equivalent and for the price there is just no reason to get the beats.TLDR: If you want a damn good pair of headphones for a damn good price, these are it.

Good but...


Super excited to tries these out today when I got home today after reading the great reviews... only to hear humming in the left ear piece as a few people have recently mentioned. Maybe there is a bad batch out right now, I'm not sure. One thing I am sure of is that it's pretty annoying between songs or if I'm listening to speech. Not bad if you have a constant stream of music going though. They were comfy during my workout and they didn't budge while skipping rope which was nice. Would have rated higher without the annoying humming/buzz.(Edit) dropped to two stars for the highly annoying buzzing and no resolution with the confident solution provided in the comments.

Just stopped working. Won't power on. I go to charge them and all I get is a blue light (that means full charge).

AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE


I would like to start out by saying I have purchased these headphones about 5 times, mainly from me losing/smashing/ or giving them as a gift. I currently own two pair that I use interchangeably on the daily. I do often times have some technical issues with them, but for the most part they provide what I need from $30 headphones. Why I am writing this review is that this company has the best customer service I have ever experienced. Their tech support runs 24/7 and clearly explains how to fix an issues you may be having, or will help setup replacement headphones to be sent. Not only this, but a REAL human being answers the phone IMMEDIATELY after calling, they don’t even transfer the phone. Simply the easiest, most stress-free, kind customer service/ company experience.

The work just fine and sound very good.  I do not know what people really expect from ear buds because the quality is somewhat limited due to the design.

After a quick phone/headphone reboot everything seems to work perfectly fine.

Dont buy this version; wrap around too soft.


The wrap-around ear pieces are so malleable that they don’t hold the earpieces in; since these earpieces are relatively heavy, not holding them firmly in place is a major design flaw.  Sound quality is passable,  but I really couldn’t get an idea of how good it is simply because the earpieces would not stay in place.  This device is sold under multiple different brand names; I had two others, both of which work adequately, but avoid the Senso brand. The other ones of this particular style are okay

I can't believe it was such a high price before. Also, I couldn't find the original price info from other website.Thus, my three star was because of the suspicious original price. If someone show me the proof of the $160, I will change my review.

Great product


I've been using them daily since I got them a week ago, and my experience has been positive so far.  These headphones work great and feel great, just like what my friends/coworkers said before my purchase.  I haven't pushed the battery life yet so I can't comment on that.The only complaint I have is the volume control isn't as fine-grained as I would like, meaning it's either too low for the background noise, or too loud that I can't stand it.  This may very well be a limitation of my phone's Bluetooth volume control, but I just wish there's more volume levels in between.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for Bluetooth headphones.

I have only been using them for a few days but I already think they are awesome. I got them because the original earphones that came with my iPhone kept falling off when I'm using them and I use them only when I'm sitting down at my desk in the office. These Senso ActivBuds don't fall off because of the over the ear hooks. Both the hooks and the earbuds are very comfortable. Now I will be able to use them when I go hiking with our dogs. I'm also going to buy a set for my daughter. Did I forget to say that the sound quality is also fantastic? Yes, it is!

Solid, long-lasting headphones


I've had these for about 14 months and am not the least bit careful with how I use them--I wear them while working out (and get super sweaty), stuff them and rip them out of my bag, and sometimes accidentally leave them on. Considering that, these headphones have held up exceedingly well! I just bought a second pair for my husband to wear running. They DO NOT come off during weightlifting, handstands, gymnastics, etc. The audio quality might not be the same level as bose, but they are crystal clear for bluetooth headphones (and especially for the price). The bluetooth works great within about 25-30 feet, even with a case on my phone or if it's in my pocket/bag. Easy to pair, and holds charge for quite a while (can usually get through a week of workouts, which is about 8 hours). Get these!

I've been testing and testing all sorts of earbud headphones and some were really nice but after a while something would stop working ... so far these have had the best sound quality and the memory foam ear piece is comfy...

Good sound and great battery, but it's larger and I have trouble keeping it in my ear


I use this while exercising at home, and wanted something to be able to move freely without being teethered.I decided on this one, but it's larger than the old one that I had, which had no battery life left.Despite trying the different size silicone tips, I find it doesn't stay in my ear super well.  I find I'm always tweaking the shape of the over the ear lobe piece, but it doesn't retain it's shape real well, and no matter what I try it doesn't sit tightly around my ear.

They work but don't impress


These headphones do their advertised job but not much more, which for the price, is totally fair. My biggest gripe is that all three sizes of rubber tips did not fit my ear and I frequently found myself re-adjusting the headphones mid-workout. A minor nuisance sure, but when you're running at more than a jog it can become annoying. Other than that, great sound and a sturdy earbud. If you want wireless headphones but don't want to pay over $100 for Bose or Apple, this should work for you.

The sound quality is nice.  For a small company the style, comfort & look is sleek, modern & plus the case is likened to  BEATS and other top shelf brands.  Easy to use and very practical.

Great headset, great price!


I've had a hard time finding a pair of headphones that don't fall out while I'm working.  These fit snugly (after putting a smaller earpiece) into my ear and the best part is the way you can mold the piece that goes over your ear to fit firmly.  They can be a little troublesome to get on but once they are on they work great! Getting a second pair for my husband who works in construction

Great value for those on the go


I needed to replace some BT earbuds after my dog chewed them and thought I'd try these.  Great value and they stay in my ear no matter how hard I exercise.  They don't get in the way and connect seamlessly to my iPhone.  Only have had them for two weeks now, but they seem to be holding up well.  Unless my previous earbuds, I haven't  gotten a battery low message yet and use them for 2 hours at a time almost every day..

This product is a good purchase.  I purchased these to have to listen to music while I workout.  The sound is good and ease of use is top notch.  The only complaint that I have with these is that the headphones I received are not ""sweatproof"".  If I sweat for more than 30-45 minutes I have found that these headphones begin turning off and changing songs randomly through the volume up and down buttons.  This also is not a profuse sweating just normal strength training sweat drips.  Last night 30 minutes into my workout, they powered off with a mostly full battery as I charged them yesterday morning.  I tried and tried to get them to power back on but to no avail.  This morning however they powered on like nothing ever happened. It seems after reading several reviews this may be an issue with my specific headphones I am not sure.  But it is quite annoying when they begin acting up midway through my workout and I am not able to listen to music for the rest of the night.

Really good sound when listening to music


Really good sound when listening to music, never cuts out, BUT if you don't have any sort of music or background audio playing and you start typing it makes an unbearably loud noise for some gosh forsaken reason, probably the reason it is discontinued. When trying to connect, if it is a saved device my iphone has a wonky time connecting to it, but once its connected it stays connected. Very very good battery life and charges super fast so 5/5 stars there. really only complaint is the loud noise it makes when typing without background audio, if you can deal with that then this is a very good priced bluetooth headphone, but i wish i knew beforehand it made the noise. I would rate 5/5 stars if it wasn't for the noise that's how bad it is.

Quality and Service


I purchased this Senso headset for my wife as a Christmas gift and this one is a hit!  We are both amazed at the quality of this product, right down from the packing that the unit came in, to the build and sound quality, and all the accessories like the carrying case, extra ear buds, etc.  My wife uses the headset on a daily basis and she notes the battery lasts for several hours on a charge, and I’m thankful for the noise isolation when I’m sleeping and she’s watching a movie.  Lastly, their customer support is just AWESOME!  The carrying case had some stitching issues, which was no big deal, but I decided to contact their support.  I gotten someone to respond back within minutes, and was shipped a replacement case instantly!  Overall, just AMAZED with this product and service!  :)

Only worked for a few  days


The first time I used these headphones the sound would cut in and out when paired with my iPod. I could sometimes turn the iPod and earphones off and on again a few times and usually I could get a fairly solid connection. After only a few days, however, the headphones stopped working entirely. They appear to be junk, or at least the set I received was.

Great pair of headphones.


I bought these to replace my old Yur buds I bought some years ago. The sound quality is solid. They lasted throughout my marathon training program and held up for the most part from excessive sweating.One downside is sometimes  a drop of sweat would get into my ear canal which would release the suction of the ear buds. Probably could be prevented if the wrap around part had a little more rigidity to it.

Used twice and died


I first synced the set to my iphone and loved them.  Used them twice and then tried to sync to my new Bose stereo in frontroom - would not work.  My husband then tried to sync to his iphone and they would not sync. I removed from my phone and tried the Bose and 2nd iphone again, still would not work. When I tried to sync to my iphone a second time it would not work.  I checked to make sure they were fully charged and tried the steps several times.  I never was able to get them to work again. I know how to use bluetooth sync and have other devices that sync - so I do not believe it was my problem - just a defective pair. Too much time passed for me to return them - very disappointed.

CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE CHARGING LESS THAN ONE HOUR


Where should I start. THESE CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE CHARGING IN MY CAR. I was driving while charging these - they'd been plugged in for about half an hour. I smelt something like burning plastic and thought something was wrong with my car. A few minutes later I see smoke coming out from below. I didn't know what it was so I pulled over immediately and saw these burning up. I was using the charger that came with these headphones. This could have caused a major accident, caught my entire car on fire, etc. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES.

Multipurpose button


I ordered these headphones and I loved them! Great sound quality and awesome for the gym! A little over a month after minimal use, the multipurpose button became defective. I couldn't power the headset on to connect the bluetooth and the button was just loose. It didn't click when I tried pressing it so I couldn't use it anymore. The indicator light still worked but it was still useless with a defective button. I decided to contact the seller and see if they would exchange it. I was willing to give it another try because I was satisfied with the headphones until they decided not to work;(. I was mindful that sometimes products have defects. The seller was awesome and immediately sent me a new pair. I didn't have to deal with the hassle of returning the defective headphones either so that was MUCH appreciated. Thank you Invotek for excellent customer service! I would definitely buy from them again.

Doesn't work consistently


Only used the headphones for 1 day before I started having issues. They skip even when my phone is less than 2ft away from they. They also don't connect to my phone right away sometimes, and my bluetooth is always on. I have to turn my bluetooth on and off and the headphones on and off multiple times for them to connect. Not worth the price for these issues to start after only one day of usage. Also, these are incredibly loud and uncomfortable. They are so loud, they give me a headache even when the volume is very low. I also have small ears, and the buds often hurt after a while. I commute an hour and a half to school and they start to hurt within an hour.

Bought these headphones recently and I am very happy with the purchase


Bought these headphones recently and I am very happy with the purchase. First things first, these headphones are not for anyone searching out audiophile quality in their headphones (however, this is to be expected for most bluetooth headphones). For wearing in public, working out, or casual listening however, these headphones get the job done very well. In these settings, the audio quality will not be noticeably different than slightly more expensive headphones. The battery life is very impressive, and the headphones themselves are reasonably comfortable. For 35 dollars, these are about the best headphones you can get. I have only had one or two pairing issues with my iPhone/ Mac Book, and these were solved easily by forgetting the device and re-pairing with it. These headphones can get VERY loud, so i recommend not going above the halfway point on the volume, or turning down the sound on the program you are listening to (for instance, if using Spotify, turning the sound separately from the sound on the headphones). All in all, I am very happy with this purchase and would buy these again if I needed another inexpensive pair.

I purchased these headphones because it looked like a deal too good to be true.. well it was. I changed out the ear tips and they don't cancel out noise. Because I can't get them to fit properly they make a popping sound when I run, which is extremely irritating and makes me hate cardio more than I already do. They also don't cancel out noise effectively when I lay down while lifting weights. I bought them several months ago and thought I could stick it out but I purchased another brand of headphones today and will see if my boyfriend has the same issues with these.

I'm somewhat a headphone snob


I own three pairs of Bose headphones, have owned Klipsh and Polk Audio, so I tend to steer toward higher end headphones. That being said, for the price, I would say these are very good.  First thing I noticed is they are extremely comfortable.  I've used them to run and they are comfortable to wear and don't slip out at all.  Immediately paired with my iPhone with no issues.  Sound wise, they are good.  Don't quite match some high end earbuds, but as I said, very good for the price.  The sound is a little base heavy and you sort of lose the high end just a little.  If you like Beats, you'll probably like these.  I prefer a more even sound, but they are still good.  Battery life is as advertised.  One big positive is the accessories that came with them, a nice hard carrying case, two port USB car charger, and a cord that has both a lighting connector and a mini-USB connector.  Overall, great quality for the price.  I've enjoyed using these on my runs and have had no issues.  UPDATE:  I had some issues pairing these with my Apple Watch 2.0.  Followed the troubleshooting instructions.  Reset the earbuds to factory settings, turned both the earbuds and the watch off.  Powered on the earbuds and then the watch.  Did the pairing process and it worked fine.  So, a little difficulty pairing with the Apple Watch, but the troubleshooting instructions worked.

This product is not at all as it was described. The headphones are extremely heavy and do not stay on even when stand, let alone when you try to move at all.

I have an armband for my ipod and in order for the blue tooth to read the head phones, I need to keep the ipod at my neck or nigh. This was absolutely not worth the money and I do not recommend that anyone purchase it. The $10 headphones are a much better investment.

Decent - not great


Sound is decent. About what you would expect at this price point. The build quality falls short in my opinion.  The ear hooks are very flimsy and upon dropping the set less than 2 feet, the protective outer cap popped off resulting loss of the volume control part.  No, I don't expect this to survive any and all unreasonable punishment, but for a device targeted to active persons on the move, it should, at a minimum, be able to withstand a drop of a very short distance.

These are my first wireless earphones and I was very excited when I got them. For the price it's actually really great headphones but there are some issues. 1. It says it lasts 6-8 hours it's more like 5 hours for me. 2. When walking outside if you have your phone in your pocket and your arm gets between the earphones and phone the sounds breaks off a lot so It probably wouldn't be a good product to jog with not like I'd know since I don't jog. 3. Battery low announcement comes on every minute when headphones are dying making it really hard to enjoy the last 5-10 mins of my music.Update: after a year and a half they don’t work anymore. Fully charged, hard reboot. They won’t turn on for more than 2 seconds if they do. Really mad.

Amazing for this price!


I've always had issues with bluetooth headphones while working out, either they weren't comfortable, or they wouldn't stay in my ears. These are very comfortable, and stays in place during any workout. Sound quality is amazing considering the price, usually you have to boost bass to get balanced audio, but with these I had to reduce bass for the first time ever and audio quality is just great. Battery life also seems in line with what is claimed. Extra accessories that came with the headphones, lightning cable and car charger also work great and is also a huge plus!

Nice Headphones, Great Customer Service.


I ordered these headphones about a month ago and like the sound and fit.  I've always had trouble getting Bluetooth Headphones to stay securely in my ears while running.  These are the best fitting Bluetooth headphones I've tried.Unfortunately after about a month the cover on the earphone broke off.  Things happen, I get it.  Sometimes you knock it just right, or there is some flaw that wasn't detected on inspection.I contacted the seller about an exchange and they responded within 10 minutes of my original email.  After a couple of emails back and forth with some follow up questions they had a new headset shipped to me that day and two days later I had my replacement.Very impressed with their customer service.  Will be buying a second pair for my wife.

If you move your head.. you will love it.. Great for Boxing


Awesome product. For the longest time I was looking for a solution for heavy bag workouts and shadow boxing where your head moves around a lot.The bluetooth around the neck didn't cute it. Over the ear models were a bit bulky, but this is just perfect without being ""Beat"" down with a really pricey model. Sound quality and paring is top notch.It comes with a variety of accessorizes. I found a winner!

Too big, tinny sound


These are much larger than they seem. The part outside the ear, with ""Senso"" on it, is two inches long and 1/2 inch wide at the cord connection. This makes them heavy and highly noticeable. I didn't want that ""I'm so busy I have to wear a bluetooth just to keep up with all my many, many calls"" look. The sound is also incredibly tinny. The carrying case is nice, though.

Great head phones for the price


Great head phones for the price. Works as they should and charge lasts for a long time.  I can't say exactly how long the battery lasts but I use them several times for a couple hours before I charge them.  sound is pretty impressive for the price.  They do not have bass like beats but are still full sounding.  Definitely recommend for workout headphones or a cheap alternative to more expensive ones.

Satisfied customer


Just bought these headphones and I'll be honest I was impressed by the way they sound and the way they fit. I was skeptical at first before buying since I wanted some alright headphones not too expensive not too crazy and these were great in sound and the comfort level. For the price its amazing the bass isn't mind blowing but it's there and these have a crisp clear sound. I'd recommend these if you're looking budget replacement headphones they're awesome. If you're looking for better bass though I wouldn't recommend these and are better off shelling out more cash.

Just what I was looking for


These headphones are great. Overall I love them, and they are exactly what I was looking for if not more.Pros:- They stay in my ears, which was a huge issue with more other headphones.- The battery lasts a while without being charged (I’m not sure exactly how long, but it’s lasted me 3 hours so far)Cons:- They aren’t noise cancelling whatsoever.- The sound quality isn’t great, but it is still pretty good.

For their price these Bluetooth earbuds are hard to beat. No, they don't sound like high end earbuds, they don't have some sexy charging case, but what you get is a decent headphone that performs accetablely and is a great compainion for the gym. I would recommend these to anyone that needs a good pair of beater ear buds to use at the gym with no regrets!

Uncomfortable fit, difficult to wear, poor sound quality


I couldn't hate these damn things more if I tried. They are uncomfortable, difficult to get to set properly in the ear. In all fairness I can run on the treadmill without them falling out but spent a couple weeks messing with them before they didnt just fall out. They have maybe a 10 foot range with my phone, if that. So forget about leaving your phone at the back of the room with your jacket, connection will be lost quite easily. Sound quality is garbage, treble is incredibly loud over the bass. Would NOT recommend at all. I'll be trying a different set once these give up the ghost. They are (okay at best) for weight lifting and i'll continue to use them for a bit given the money spent. Honestly they are incredibly cheap feeling and sounding for the price.

The Bluetooth connection is choppy - not worth the money


Theses are just okay. They are inexpensive and have okay sound quality. My biggest issue is that the Bluetooth cuts in and out. I use Bluetooth speakers at home and have no issues even when I am inside and the speakers are outside, but when my phone is even in my pocket these headphones will cut in and out, which is very annoying and ruins my listening experience.I really wanted to like these at this price point, but they are essentially unusable.

Great Product for a Great Price!


These are great! Not sure what others are referring to when they say it's too loud unless my ears are bad. When I work out I like extremely loud music too. These are a perfect solution for anyone that just wants hassle free music while working out. I'm not into the latest and greatest so these were perfect quality for me personally. It does take some time to get used to them and figure out the best way to wear them in your ears. I messed with them for a while until I figured out what would be most comfortable and now they are perfect! Great price for what you get in my opinion.Thanks!

I was very happy with the response and the customer service and went ...


I bought the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones in August 2017. They worked well until February 6, 2018 then they just stopped working.  They would not turn on or charge.  This was very discouraging because I used them every day.  I went to the website and saw the headphones had a year warranty.  I contacted the seller and was able to talk to a live person.  He helped me make some tests to determine if they were dead or if there was another problem.  He determined they were in fact dead, so he verified my name and address and said they would send me out another pair in 7 to 10 days.  I was very happy with the response and the customer service and went away feeling good about the experience.  What really excited me was when I received the new pair only 3 days after the conversation.  I am impressed with the responsiveness and customer service I experienced.  I would recommend this company and product to anyone.

These headphones have fantastic sound just as advertised! The bass is great and treble is clear! However, like so many reviewers before me (that I ignored since these were at such a great sale price) said, they ARE SO LOUD OH MY GOODNESS!! Way too loud!! I had to put it at the lowest volume level possible and set the equalizer to ""Late Night"" just to be able to safely listen to them! Even with some songs they are too loud!

Weak adjustable earpieces


I love the high volume, specially when I'm running now the problem is the adjustable earpieces, its so weak, it keeps falling. I have to keep stopping my cardio session to adjust them back to my ears.I'm not sure about the noise cancellation because my family always complains the noises and I hear it as well.

I hope they last a while because these are exactly what I have been looking for at a reasonable price.

There's better earphones out there


I dislike these earphones , I got them because i thought they were gonna be better but I felt them loose when working and the wire that goes behind the head was uncomfortable when sweating , I tried using the clip to shorten the length, It made no difference , the sound quality is great but the earphones are not to comfortable . I ended up giving them away . I do not believe that the price was set up to $160 and discounted to $39 they're simply not good enough to have really been at that price.

Great balance on price, design and sound quality


This is by far the best ear plug style head set that I have ever purchased.  I bought this for its strong bass support and I am not disappointed.  The quality of the sound is very good.  I wear it for work out and the design allows the head set stay on my ears all the time.  Granted, I don't shake my head much.  So if you move your head a lot with it, you may need to test it yourself.  But the sound quality and price is great.  With that said, I did run into an issue where the led light won't shut down and it continues to drain the battery.  I bought this back in Oct 2016 and it is now Apr 2017.  So this does concern me a bit.  But when I file a customer service issue, they walk me through a reset process and it didn't work.  So they ship me a replacement one because I am still under warranty.  So their Customer Service is very good in taking care of my issue.  Overall, I am happy with the device and their customer services.  Great product.

one of the best amazon purchases I've made


This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I've had apple earbuds, headsets... and they really can get in the way when you're a university student constantly pulling out stuff from your bag (I've destroyed many earbuds because the strings get tangled or get stretched). This is a compact set of headphones that don't need to be charged often, stay in your ears and around your neck, really light while also sporting a pretty good audio quality. Also, the bluetooth system is really nice, and the design is pretty nice. Overall, very, very satisfied and am considering buying a pair for a friend.

I normally dislike ear buds because they are uncomfortable for me but for the price I figured why not.  Got them and was impressed by the case, extra ear pads, car charger and two cords.  Charged them and listened to them and they sound nice with good bass.  I haven't had a chance to put them to use while I'm working to see how well they stay in place but there is no way they can be as bad as the headphones I had previously.

Works Great!


These headphones work great! I wanted a headphone so I didn't need to carry my phone with me everywhere while listening to a pod cast or music and that would also cancel outside noise in the process and these headphones did just that. They came with a stylish case, and charging cable. They also came with some fun accessories which is a nice touch. Easy to use with a variety of ear size adapters which make them easy to fit in your ear. You can also switch them out for others to use them without using your specific ear plug. Nice!

I've had these headphones for about a month now and I absolutely love them. The sound quality is good for what it is, but the volume is impressive. I usually have headphones on max volume and I dont have to with these. I go to the gym and workout so they stay on great.

Great wireless headphones for the price!


I really like these headphones. Bluetooth works great and the earpieces are incredibly comfortable, including the silicone-type flap. The sound is alright, but what more can you expect from $34 headphones? It said they were originally over $140ish but I don't know if this was just a simple markup or if this was a consistent price. Anyway, I think they're well worth the price... at least for now.Will update in a few months if and when sound goes out in one earpiece :)

They are comfortable to wear


Still somewhat undecided. They are comfortable to wear.  But I give three stars so far because I don't like the weird high pitched background sound that occurs when you turn them on -- and although it say ""up to 8 hours"" of playback, I think it's more on the 6 hour range, they are also bulkier than I thought they would be.I don't get that high pitched background sound with my other blue tooth head phones.The price is good and I am interested to see how durable they are with burpees.

I love the SENSO Bluetooth headsets


I love the SENSO Bluetooth headsets. I have purchased plenty of products on Amazon and read hundreds of reviews over the years while doing research. However I have never written a review. I bought the headset for working out, I run and lift weights so I wanted something light , comfortable, sweat resistant, and inconspicuous. I landed on the SENSO based on reviews from users who had a similar need.The design is perfect for active users as it fits snuggly and is secured by the over the ear hooks.The sound quality is very good. I don't have the most discerning ear for music so , I may not be the best judge in that regard but the sound is  crystal clear with deep base response.  I have not had a chance to use them on a call but is not my primary need. I mostly work out indoors but did hear some wind noise while outside. Wasn't major but was noticeable.Invotek, has been the most responsive seller I have dealt with. Their customer service  and follow-up is top notch. I  recommend them highly  and would definitely purchase from them again.

Every once in a while, you get to do business with a special company.  Senso is that sort of outfit.  Everything about this purchase was just....right. The product packaging was easy to open, yet nicely protective of the headphones.  The ""kit"" included everything I needed.  Ever bought something and find out that the cable or battery or some such is not included?  Not these folks.  Each component was nicely engineered for usability.They kindly sent me a video in my email that has nice little tutorials on usage.  The manual was laminated so that it will last.  The USB charger has nice caps to protect the ends.  The headphones are easy to put on, light on my head, and clear to the ear.  I could go on.  Seriously ---you need to buy something from them just to experience their clear commitment to excellence.If these folks are selling stock, I'd be interested.  They are going to do well.

Very low quality. Save your money.


I bought these to wear for running outdoors since they were advertised as sweat proof and active headphones.The Bluetooth connectivity on them is terrible if attempting to put your device in an arm band or anything else that would obstruct absolute path from the headphones to the device. Just placing my phone under my arm while the Bluetooth is connected causes the headphones to start to skip and lose connection.Wearing them outside on a breezy day makes it sound like you're in a wind tunnel and requires turning up the volume nearly all the way to hear the music.I have a similar looking pair I paid twenty bucks for that have much better connectivity and don't have any issue no matter how windy it is outside.Skip this brand and buy the $20 pair at Walmart that look similar to these but are just black. They're much better quality.

I love the no cords to get tangled as I work around the house! I also enjoy being able to answer the phone with just a click of the button while listening to a book.  I wish the ear bud portion could be adjusted to point either straight into the ear or slightly to the rear instead of to the front.

Not really sweat/water resistant


The sound on these is good. However, there are a few problems with them that are important to point out. First, they are very sensitive to being within line-of-sight of your phone or music player. I ran with them on my left arm, but the control bud is in my right ear (that is also where the controls are). This seems to lead to the connection being broken. After I switched the phone to my other arm, the connection was more solid. Second, despite being sweat/water resistant, once they get wet from sweat they are also susceptible to losing the Bluetooth connection. In that case, it cannot be re established until the buds dry out...which obviously is not happening in the middle of a run. So, good sound, affordable price, and no cables is great. But general unreliability in terms of connection is regrettable.

but a bit less comfortable (sorry, i dont have a link to them)


These headphones have worked perfectly for the job that I enlisted them for, as workout headphones at the gym. I had a very similar pair of headphones before this, which had a bit of a tighter earpiece so they were a snugger and more reliable fit, but a bit less comfortable (sorry, i dont have a link to them). Unfortunately, I put those ones in the main pouch of my backpack and forgot they were there, so they got smashed up and broke. These Senso ones were the replacement.I think they sound a bit better than the other ones, which is a plus, and the Senso ones come with a nice soft shell case which would have prevented the other ones from breaking. Pretty much the only negative is the slightly loose earpiece. Its difficult to run while wearing these, because the earpiece is too soft and gel like, which doesn't really give enough of a fit for these heavy headphones to handle the bouncing that running brings.Overall, I love them, and they are easily worth the roughly $35 i spent.

The sound quality isn't as good as default apple headphones


The headphones do what I want them to do. They stay in my ears while exercising, stay connected to my phone via bluetooth without losing connection or making weird noises, and they have decent noise cancellation. The sound quality isn't as good as default apple headphones, but that's to be expected from headphones this cheap. I'm really annoyed by the really loud ""paused"" and ""power low"" notifications, but it can be avoided. I've been using them for 4 months and they haven't broken or stopped working at all, which is a good sign.

Just over 3 months of use everyday, the volume piece started coming apart and 4 months later the battery wouldn't take a charge (neither covered in warranty). So I decided to try other wireless headphones that weren't as expensive.  I tried several from best buy that were $50 to $70 dollar range and their battery charge was much less than advertised (I couldn't finish an hour workout!)  So I returned them and tried these.  So far so good!  3 workouts in and still on same charge.  They are about the size of the beats and the buttons work well and seem logical.  Sound to me is similar to my beats.  I'll update if I have any future issues.

Not bad, but not great


Purchased product to try and rid the hanging cords while running. I charged them up, put them in my phone arm band for a run, the headphones were cutting in and out the entire run. Since this incident, I have only ran with the phone outside of the armband. The headphones seem to do ok. They occasionally still cut out during my run. Additionally, when i turn my head, the headphones seem to come out of my ear a bit. Not bad, but not great. I'll get something better.

They don't make them like they used to!


This is the second pair of these Senso headphones ive bought. The first pair came in September of 2017 and i was actually very satisfied, the sound quality on those first pair, the ease of use, fitment, packaging all left a great first impression. Through wear and tear they ended up breaking and thought hell, why not get another. This second pair is NOT of the same quality of those that i purchased a few years back. The sound on these sound muffled, terrible in fact, theres no EQ or anything that can help them either. The physical product is all the same, but unfortunately times have changed and so did the quality of sound on these.

These work great for a few months, then quality quickly fades. Bluetooth and battery flaws. Read the fine print!


These work great for a few months, then quality quickly fades. I used these daily for about 4 months without problem. Now, my bluetooth connection is intermittent, and battery life has been reduced to about 2 hours. Essentially making these worthless. There is some fine print within the instructions that tell you not to use a 'fast charge cable'. My god, what charger out there is not quick charge now? Might be worth another additional $30 investment for an updated bluetooth driver and better overall quality pair of headphones. Disappointed.

Looks good, but...


Had high hopes for these and was disappointed in light of all the positive reviews. The first thing I noticed when pairing them was that there is a low level electronic buzzing or whining in the left earpiece when it is receiving an audio signal, like music and such. Mind you, I'm not an audiophile by any stretch. It's particularly noticeable with tracks where there is a fade in our out to a track or if there is a slight break in the audio. It's also more noticeable with spoken word audio, like audiobooks or talk radio where there are natural breaks in the speaking, not to mention classical music. I tried a number of things to remedy the issue, such as restarting my iPhone, resetting the headset, eliminating any other competing bluetooth signals, and even different devices. The whining/buzzing was still present. I even ordered a second pair and found the exact same issue. For whatever reason, the issue is not present in the right earphone (yes, my hearing is fine in that ear) on both sets of headphones.The issue, as I see it, rests in the likelihood that this is not a product that the company actually manufactures itself. You'll notice a variety of different headphones on Amazon that basically look identical to these but have a different badge on the side. A review of online overseas sellers reveals that headphones/headsets that look just like this one are sold frequently by way of China and have the same specs, while selling from those markets for around half of what this and other Amazon sellers charge for their branded versions. It is perhaps a lesser known aspect of the manufacturing juggernaut that is China. While seeming to be a high tech product for the casual consumer, headphones like these with personalized branding on the sides is a bit like the custom made pens, mugs, etc. that you can get at any number of local office stores.Long story short, I don't really have an issue with a company reselling items like this under their own brand, but in my experience, it doesn't bode well if there are technical issues with the product. e.g., Does the company/seller have any sway in getting the issues corrected if they are simply one of many resellers and are not actually directly involved in the manufacturing of the product? Or, are they basically stuck reselling the item as-is and left hoping these issues don't crop up or are noticed by consumers?With all of that said, I am debating keeping one of the pairs that I purchased? Why? Because one of the primary uses I bought these for was for listening to music or radio streaming while I'm working, with a key emphasis on staying in place. For example, if I'm working out, mowing the lawn, chainsawing some trees, or even just assembling furniture with some degree of physical exertion, then the low-level whining and buzzing sin't likely to be noticed. I'm guessing that a fair share of reviewers are probably not sitting around quietly either, which might be why the buzzing/whining isn't noticed by more owners/reviewers. So far, they do stay in place pretty well, with the earbud basically staying in place regardless of what I've been up to. I did expect that the earpiece would be adjustable, which isn't the case, so the fact that it stays in place as well as it does with a one size fits all approach is good to see. In sum, I would say that this is a functional headset that will probably work for most folks if they are actively doing something while using them. For anyone who has had more expensive wireless headsets like I have (Jaybird, Pantronics) and that don't have a hearing impairment, then its likely that the buzzing will be noticeable. If you're buying these to be a pair of beater earphones to workout or do yardwork with, these will probably work for you. Don't expect, however, that they will be of the same quality as the brand/model they are patterned after, the Beats Powerbeats earphones. As it is, I will very likely be picking up a pair of the Powerbeats 3 headphones due to the impression the Senso headphones have left me with, assuming some markdowns occur with Black Friday this year. :-)

Light, good battery.  But pairing issues.


These have a longer battery life than some of the other bluetooth headphones, but they often don't like to pair.  It can be frustrating as, at times, you have to unpair it from another device so the new device will pair with it also.  Yet, I believe it is supposed to be able to pair with more than one device at a time.  Technically it does...it just won't work on the newest device until you unpair it from the other.

Won't stay connected


I have had this headset for a few months with light use (I haven't sweated in them) and it won't stay connected to my phone even though other devices do. I only needed a headset for hands-free driving. I could have gotten an $80-100 set for the price I will have spent after replacing these.

Ok for low activity use


Bought these to use while running, lifting, and doing HIIT.Pros: Light weight, buttons are very crisp/solid, decent sounding audio, lots of accessories (duel port car charger: 1 and 2 amp slots, 2 charging cables: one 3 foot cable, one 11 inch cableCons: They do not stay very secure while running and moving around (I wore sunglasses and had to put the arm of the glasses over the ear hook to keep them steady while running), the audio did cut out intermittently like my phone was several rooms away even though I was wearing it in an arm band only 6 inches away, the wire tie does not stay on very well so there if you try to adjust it while wearing the headphones there is a good chance you will just end up pulling it off.

Durable and high quality for the pricing


These headphones are a decent pair of headphones for those who don't want to invest in high-end brands, and who don't mind replacing them more frequently. I used these for a little over 1.5 years, which is longer than any other pair of headphones I've used (possibly due to the bluetooth aspect - less tugging on the cord). The price was also higher when I purchased it, so I'd recommend them. They're tough enough to take to the gym, and they lasted a long time when you consider how much I threw them around without using the case. My only complaints were that they're a bit loud (the voice telling you they're on/off), the occasional syncing issue, and that they're bulkier than regular earbuds so those with small ears might be uncomfortable after long uses. Overall, the sound was still good quality and consistent. They've only now after a year and a half stopped working (sound is okay, bluetooth connection issues).

Not so good.


Well once again I learned you get what you pay for. The bluetooth keeps disconecting constantly. I had read that in other reviews but thought I would be better. So its not. And if you use them with something loud like a Lawn mower the engine interferes with the bluetooth as well. I have more expensive ones that work all the time but i wanted a cheaper pair for yard work. They don't work so good.

Definitely worth it


I've been looking for a pair of wireless headphones for a while, and after a Kickstarter not delivering on their product, I started looking for a cheaper alternative. For $30, these are definitely worth the price. While they look a little bulky, they're really lightweight and the sound/connectivity is surprisingly great! At a medium volume and the correct sized earbud, they block out a good amount of sound. I have smaller ears and my daith pierced on each side and these are really comfortable sitting in my ears for some time on end.

Purchased these for active wear and they work pretty well.  They come with a pair of foam ear tips which you can compress a little when putting them on--kind of like foam earplugs.  These are nice, but they also have the standard s/m/l rubber ear tips like just about all other earbuds come with if you like those.  The ear clip/loops are OK, they are not at all stiff so you cant really adjust them to hold the earbuds in place; however, they do keep the earbuds from falling all the way out.

Incredible sound for an incredible price.


The short and sweet is you are getting a great pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound phenomenal for their price. Obviously, they will not compare to the high-end models, but they certainly do the job well, even in the bass department. It is easy to use and sync and stays connected fairly well when staying within expected Bluetooth range.The only complaint I have is the low battery alert. It is maddening for a voice signal to trigger what seems like every thirty seconds. A visual or longer interval would be nice.Aside from that, I would certainly recommend purchasing this.

They are a comfortable fit. Sound is great. Bough then because of a few things first of all read the reviews which were good. The price was reasonable and they had blue tooth. I paired it with my iPhone7. No one ridiculous cord in my phone. Plus I use the ear buds for hours while I was sewing and didn’t have an problems. No sound problems provided u keep the device that they are paired with close by. Walk to far away and gets a little staticky.

My husband and I absolutely love these little headphones. They work better than most of the over the head wireless headsets.  I also love the fact that even if I turned the volume up the person next to me is not hearing my music. The only issue I have is that when I'm working out and sweating the cord sometimes sticks to my neck or shirt and pulls the ear plug loose from my ear. But overall they are a perfect fit for those who like bass.

They are very okay


Pros:- Price is right(ish)- They stay in my ear very well- Mildly noise cancelling (better than I expected)Cons:- Noise cancellation goes right out the window if it's windy (as is the case with most headphones)- The buttons are right on the side attached to the earpiece (as opposed to on the wire) so it is a little awkward to change volume/go to next song without moving the earpiece uncomfortably in your ear.- The sound quality is a little worse than I was expecting. I have a pair of $15.00 earbuds which have slightly better quality, and an $8.00 pair with slightly worse quality.Overall I'd recommend these headphones if you are prioritizing headphones which stay in your ear during a run or eliminate noise at the gym, but I would NOT recommend them if you are into super clear sound quality or you like to skip songs often during a run.

but that light is useless unless you’re continuously looking in a mirror


I’ve been using these earbuds for about four months and agree with the positive reviews except for one shortcoming: the time duration between the first audio signal of low battery strength and the actual shutdown is only about 20 minutes (the user guide says it is several hours, but that’s not been my experience). There is a red indicator light on the ear buds that indicates low battery, but that light is useless unless you’re continuously looking in a mirror.Otherwise it’s a great product, especially for the price.

Excellent battery life, comfortable, works exactly as advertised


Other bluetooth headsets have left something to be desired. I've used these for 9 hours straight at work (construction industry) without so much as a low battery warning.  This was at a medium-low volume level, which is the only way to not sustain hearing damage. You get :-4 sets of earpieces of varying sizes including a soft closed cell foam set, which I imagine would make these work as passable hearing protection. Ill test this at work with a 130db hammer drill and update.-2 different charging cords including a USB to lightning port adapter-nice zippered caseUsed them in the rain with no problems. No issues connecting to device. Mic works fine. After wearing them all day they remained comfortable. And i can't help but extol the great battery life. Would definitely buy again.

This is my first purchase of Bluetooth headphones. I have always been unwilling to give up sound quality for the convenience of Bluetooth. Regardless of the number of pairs of wired headphones / airbuds I would destroy, I kept going back to them. When I decided to take the Bluetooth plunge I spent hours of research, looking to find the best bang for the buck. I will say without a doubt that Invotek's SENSO Bluetooth headphones are absolutely amazing. I find that I am now listening to music, podcasts, etc. at times that I never used to because the wire would get in the way. And the sound quality from SENSO is incredible.

Stopped working properly within about 4 months of use


Wish I could give these a better rating but no can do. Sound gets cut off randomly when riding my bike or sometimes even when walking. I've owned them for about 4 months now. They worked well at first but over the past month the sound has been getting worse especially in the left earpiece, as it has progressively gotten quieter leading me to have to play my music louder. To cap things off, the left earpiece has now completely gone bad to the point where I could barely hear any sound coming out of it if any at all. Tried resetting but didn't help. Having owned multiple different bluetooth earbuds like this, these have so far had one of the shortest lifetimes, in terms of how long I've owned and used them for, before they stopped working properly.

Top brand quality sound and fit.


Was looking for an alternative for powerbeats and came across these.  Just exactly as described and exactly what I was looking for.  I use these for mainly weight lifting and casually use while cleaning house.  The fit is real nice with the extra set of buds to swap out had to go with the smallest.  What I was really surprised at was the clairty/loudness and the quality bass with these headphones. They have never slipped out of my ear one time even during hard sweaty workouts.  I use a galaxy s7 active and all controls on the ear piece  including volume works well with.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the fact it wants to cut out and skip like a broken record sometimes  when my phone is in my back pocket.  Front pocket or in hand no problem while I'm listening with the headset. It also does this when I first connect to phone but disconnecting the Bluetooth on the phone and reconnecting fixes this issue fine. The battery is also great so far charged them one time before my first use and still going strong on their first charge. Will definitely buy another pair if something was to happen to these.

Great until they broke...


I was about to leave a great review (5 star).... but then they broke. They were perfect. The price, sound and mic quality, battery life, comfort, were great. It hasn't even been 30 days yet (almost 30 days) and the ear bud detached from the housing. I'm hoping they will replace them. I really did like them up until they busted. I have used them constantly since I have received them and would maybe understand this happening after a few months even since I use them all the time but not after a few weeks. Delivered Oct 8th broke Oct 30th

Good but can be better


The price is right, the headphones come with a cool carrying case and other items most do not. I like that they are blue tooth... the downfall is the sound QUALITY. They are loud enough but the quality isn't there. They also don't fit right. I think it is the angle the headphone itself is offset at. I've tried all of the extra size fittings and it is either a hastle to get them in to where they fit or they just don't fit right. I do like that the blue tooth can stay connected from about 25-30 feet away. It's a decent product but obviously for around $30 you can't really beat it. If you made a product with better sound quality and that fit a little better for 40-50 $ I would be all over it. This company has strong potential to do more. Thank you for your product

Great Headsets!


I love these headsets. I use them in the car (when I remember to grab them from the counter in the house), when I mow the yard, and sometimes when I ride my bicycle. I have purchased several different Bluetooth headsets over the years and I always stopped using them eventually. These are definitely my favorite yet. Sound is good. There is enough bass for me to be happy. I still need to use someone else's phone to call mine with a friend using these headsets to know the quality of using these for phone calls. They sound great from my end, though.

I would highly recommend these for anyone wanting a durable long lasting bluetooth headphone.


Great headphones for any sort of sport enthusiast. I use mine for mainly gym use, they sound great and are very comfortable drowning out any unwanted gym noise. I did use them at home and fell asleep with them waking up 3 hours later thinking they might need to be charged so I plugged them in and it wasn't about 10 mins later they were fully charged and ready to go again, so they have a great long lasting battery life.

Solid for the price


Purchased these in January 2017. It is now March 2018 and the Bluetooth connection is really spotty now. There had always been some connectivity issues but now, no sound plays from the left ear piece. Nevertheless, I’d say it was a decent purchase for less than $40. Lots of accessories included for the price and the sound and battery are pretty good as well. Decent amount of bass. I would recommend sticking to a more well established electronics brand here on Amazon.

These are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased


These are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased. I never invested in any of my headphones until I got these and I am very pleased. They have already outlasted my previous ones. I use them for running and lifting and I never have to adjust them throughout my workouts. They have a decent battery life - I charge them every 3 - 4 workouts, which usually last about 1:40 minutes. I ALWAYS have my music blasting. They also conceal outside noise and sometimes I'll even wear them to focus a bit more and detach from everything when at school. The little back piece that loops around your ear is rubber and flexible. It is attached to the ear piece and fits nicely around my ear lobe. I never had an issue after getting sweat on them. They are pretty nice and worth the investment!

I got these because I wanted to listen to music while I practice shooting hoops. I was worried they were going to be loose or come off as I ran around the court but day #2 and they're steady and haven't slipped off once.I'm running around like crazy, doing lay ups and cutting to the basket and these stay on.I have a iphone 6s and I can walk around the half court with my phone in my bag on the side and there's no issue with the bluetooth.I sweat like crazy so I'll update this later to see how long these last...

Solid pair of gym headphones


Good overall sound quality. Still wondering how waterproof they are because I sweat a lot at the gym. They can last about 3 2-hour gym sessions before needing a charge, but they use the same microUSB as my phone. This allows me to charge them during the day when my phone is not being charged. I do get interesting feedback occasionally, which makes me worry about their long term reliability. Sound quality is good overall for earbuds.

I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about these. I've run with them a few times and each time had a different thing I don't love. First of all, I can't get any of the plugs to stay in my ears right. I sweat a lot and they just slip out. I've tried all 3 sizes. Also, sometimes the Bluetooth is spotty even though my device is only 3-4 feet away at the most. Hopefully I can find a way to at least keep them in my ears while I run.

Why spend hundreds when you can buy these?


My favorite headphones ever. While there are certainly headphones with better sound quality, there is no more comfortable, cost effective, and easy to use headphone. I wear them around the house, working out, out around town running errands, everywhere.There is the annoyance of running into the wind where the sound quality is diminished but other than that I can't fault the headphones.

Not great for working out. Spotty Bluetooth reception


These are good for general use but they have a very limited blue range. Often they don’t work in colder weather too at or below 40 degrees. While running the reception is spotty and i’d often hear my music cut out which is not something you want during a run. I had to buy a different brand after all that.

This was a gift for my husband and he's very happy with it! The ear pieces are nice, it comes with foam on them, and then alternate sizes of plastic earpieces. The sound buttons are easy to find. He likes it because he can wear them at work with one side in, and he works in a clean environment, so the ear hook helps ensure they don't fall out, or dangle, and cause contamination. He also noticed that the bass is really good. Thanks for making me look like a good wife.

Good for 41/2 months,then pooped out!


Bought these in the end of April 2017, and now they have completely stopped working. Only 4 and a half months later. They first started skipping in one ear and then just stopped working all together. Prior to them malfunctioning they were awesome. So  dissappointed.I received a replacement pair and now 14 months later this pair has completely stopped working. Even though the warranty is two months over they will not replace them!If you want earbuds that last less than a year then get these it’s planned obsolescence in my opinion and throwing good money away!

The headphones are solid. Good bass, good sound. The battery life is to be expected. The buttons feel really good to press and the connection boots up great with my phone.

I have only had these ear buds for a few days, but WOW!!! So far I'm loving them, they were super easy to pair, the sound is fantastic and the noise cancellation is superb. My husband called while I was wearing them and even he was impressed with the sound during our phone conversation. It's not an easy feat to impress him either. And it's very easy to switch modes to take a call.Also, I have recieved two emails since I've had them from the company making sure I am happy with my purchase and offering to make it right if I'm not. If these things keep working like they have I hope to never have to contact customer service, but it sure is nice to know that someone still cares about the customer and wants to make sure their happy!!

Decent in all ways except not very durable


I was so excited when I ordered these because I had not trouble getting to connect to my phone or computer via bluetooth, and was impressed with the bluetooth range (I could walk around my apartment no problem without compromising sound. However, within weeks of using the headphones, one of the earbuds fell off. I was able to place it back together, but it was such a drag to have to do it over and over. Pretty soon after that, sound stopped playing from that ear bud, and then the front end of it fell off, so I was running around with just one work ear bud. I was excited because these ear buds were recommended for runner and did not break my budget, but I now realize it might be better to place down more money for a sturdier, albeit more expensive, product. Very frustrated!

Overall great headphones! Stay in my ears and get the job done. I was simply looking for headphones to use while I work out because I was tired of normal wired ones falling out. The only complaint I have (and comes from me being a musician/picky sound guy) is that they are very bassy. I had to mess with the eq in my Spotify app to get the highs more clear in the headphones. But that's me being picky! Overall great for the price.

Probably OK for working out in Gym, but not while riding a bike


While I wasn't expecting much for $37, I still returned them. I use them while riding my bike on a bike path. There is a constant wind noise coming from what sounds like the microphones. It forces you to turn up the volume to compensate. That in itself may have been OK, but the connection kept dropping out while riding. The phone and headphones were no further than 4 feet apart.  I never had that issue with my previous Bluetooth headphones (Plantronics) which finally gave up after 4-5 years. Too annoying to keep

I really like the design


I really like the design, alal the stuff it comes it and all. But the audio quality isn't very good. Which was a big turn off as soon as I put something on. I own an Ncredible One, which is a cheaper version of Beats, but the audio is just great. So buying this wasn't the best thing I did. I know it's a 35 dollar piece compared to 100 dollar headphone, but if like me, audio is a big deal for you, I wouldn't recommend it. Ah, the battery is also very annoying because it let's you know it's low when it's reaaaally low. So before you reach an outlet it's already dead and no more music for you.

I've bought several different sets of ear buds on Amazon because I am cheap and won't pay for Bose or other name brand ones.These are by far the most comfortable. The bass is the best I've heard out of sports headphones. They are really quite comfortable. The Bluetooth covers a long distance. They have a great battery life.  Most importantly, they stay in when I run and work out! Add to that it comes with multiple chargers different size buds, etc. I haven't found any negatives yet.

Meh :/


I needed some good wireless headphones, and after doing some extensive searching, I found these and purchased SPECIFICALLY because it stated high definition audio with a wide audio spectrum sound in description (also listed as ""Amazon's choice""). However, the audio is, in fact NOT high quality or a wide spectrum of sound.The low frequencies are fuzzy and cut out the rest of audio, and the extra high frequencies you can't even hear. Makes all music and movies sound like almost 8 bit ""lo-fi"". Unfortunately, I can only use these now to make phone calls. Not a good sound experience with these. If I would have known this listing description is not as described, I would have just bought the cheaper ones. Bummed and out almost $40. I stongly recommend  to either buy the cheaper ones or the more expensive ones. I would avoid these.

Deep deep sound


I use these to work out 5 days a week. They have done well so far. They have about 7 hours of use and charge fast, but the sound is deep. Like they wanted extra base but also added in a cavern. Changing the settings on your phone didn’t add to the quality to me. If you can get past that the case, variety of ear pieces, malleability of the behind the ear parts, and the easy functions make this a good buy.

Not a bad Bluetooth headphone


I received the headphone a day before and is in the process of testing it. As advertised, the headphone stays on your head even under a lot of motions. The overall sound is decent, with clear mid/high, punchy bass (little muddy) but you get what you pay for.However, I noticed a buzzing noise when the headphone is on which can be quite annoying if there is no music playing. I have tested it with both iPhone and Android, same buzzing sound so I don't think my phones are the cause. It would be nice if there's a solution because I love the look of this headphone.

UPDATE: After speaking with the Support Team, they are sending me another one. I'll update later if the headphones don't work; however, A+ for support.I'm very sorry for this rating. Truly I am. I loved these headphones when I first received them. They worked perfectly (unlike any Bluetooth headphones I used before); however, about three weeks ago, they started to randomly turn off or lose connection. I thought it might be my phone, but it happened with my laptop as well. In the middle of the video/music, it turns off. Or sometimes when I tap the multifunction button to pause music, it will shut the headphones off altogether. (I'm not holding in the button. I'm only tapping it.) Sometimes even tapping the volume buttons turns off the headphones. I have factory reset the headphones four times now to no avail.What's wrong with these headphones?

I have used these maybe 15 times total and the right ear is already cutting out and not working properly. While I'm running the cord bounces some and it cuts out in the right ear every time the cord moves.

I bout the SENSO Bluetooth Headphones three months ago and couldn't be happier.  The stay in my ear without constant adjusting and fidgeting with them.  The ear pieces are very comfortable.  The best features are the long battery life - a whole week at the gym without having to recharge, and the volume control.  Highly recommended.

Excellent choice for earbuds!


These Invotek Senso ActiveBuds are excellent! Bought my husband a pair first. We go to the gym often and our other ear buds just don't stand up to our exercising. The ActiveBuds not only stay in, they have quality sound and are great for phone calls! The charge lasts my husband's whole entire work day in which he has numerous conference calls, he charges it on the way home and it's ready for the gym! Very happy with the product. Ordered myself a pair and will order another pair for our 16 year old son! Maybe even for our older girls as Christians presents also!!

Love my Senso bluetooth headphones


My Senso wireless bluetooth earbuds stopped holding a charge after a few months of use. The amazing thing was how quickly The company responded to my message. They got back to me within hours on a weekend. I tried their suggestions for getting the earbuds to charge but without any luck. Within a day, they had honored their 1-year warranty and are sending me a new pair. This company has a good product and incredible customer service.

Amazing sound, great battery life and the customizable fit / ear buds were perfect! Right out of the box, which comes with a few extra little cool items including a nice carrying case, I powered these up and mowed my lawn. They stayed perfectly in place even with the sweat and I couldn't even hear the noise of the mower. The sounds are crisp, clean and not overpowering.

Perfect for sports up to a point


The overall I enjoy the headphone but they have their limitations. I bought them for working out because I got tire of my phone falling out of my pocket; I do a lot of plyometric workouts (MMA, jump rope, crossfit, etc).-The headphones solved my phone falling problem. However, they are prone to being knocked loose after a minute or two of jump rope, any intense heavy bag work, etc. I think the issue could be resolved if the plastic that surrounds the ear were a bit firmer.-The range on the headphones is great, probably like 30 feet through a few walls. I had one instance where the signal had become spotty even though the phone was less than two feet from me, but that might have been due to low battery.-Lastly the headphone have great acoustics up to the point where there is an extreme amount of base. I would say about 95% of music is fine, but you love to blast dubstep or extreme base music than these probably wouldn't be the best fit.

These are great blue tooth earbuds!


I've only had them for 3 days but I have used them 3 times and I am very happy with the sound quality while I'm running.  The big test will be on my motorcycle.  I've been told they have good sound quality for phone calls also, so overall I'd have to say I'm very pleased so far.So, after using them for 6 months the right speaker stopped working. As they are under warranty I contacted Invotek. Within 36 hours they had talked me through an attempt to do a factory reset and, when that failed,  had a replacement in the mail.  Excellent value, excellent sound, excellent customer service!!

Great product!!!


I am truly blown away at how good these sound. The bass is very full. The packaging comes with extras which are nice. Also the case it comes in is great. I also have a pair of Powerbeats and these hold their own against them. If I had to make one complaint, it’s that the ear piece that goes over the back of your ear seems a little too soft. However, for the price this is easy to live with.  Connected great with my iPhone XS Max.

Crappy bass quality


I'm not sure if this product is really as bad as two stars however I bought these because they are rated 4 and 1/2 Stars over so many people and I needed to balance it out because I think the base quality is absolutely terrible if there is anything with a lot of bass it sounds like a bad speaker and I feel it's totally unacceptable if I knew this is how they sounded I would not have ordered them

The headphones just quit working after about 45 minutes.


I was intrigued by the reviews, and I wanted to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that fit over the ear. I was concerned about the size for use while running, but they were comfortable. I charged them up and connected them to my phone. The connection was constantly dropping in and out from the moment I first used them, but after 45 minutes they just quit working. The phone was never about 12-18 inches from the headphones at any point. I have owned a few Bluetooth headphones, and these are by far the worst.

High quality bluetooth headset for workouts and hands-free calls at a great value


I've owned mine for about a year. They're comfortable, loud (adjustable), and have a good battery life. Mic is good, I haven't had remote callers complain. These earbuds stay perfectly in place during workouts. I don't often write Amazon reviews for consumer electronics, but this truly is a wonderful device, and the best I've ever owned in its class. Highly recommended.

Wow, I have been very impressed with these headphones. They are my third pair of Bluetooth headphones I have owned, and they rate at the top. Everything has been great about them from the very quick shipping to the packaging and all of accessories you get with them. They are very well built, and the quality of them for the price exceeded my expectations.  The clarity of them is incredible for the cost. They appear to be very durable and I feel confident they well last a long time. They paired up the quickest of my three Bluetooth headsets.

Not even six months


I bought these for my son so he could lift weights without having to deal with wire earbuds. Not even six months and they are broken. He charges it all night and the buds don't even respond. He doesn't use them for sleeping and told me that they don't even start. Who knows, to be objective, I have one that has lasted for almost a year. But it seems too late to return for an exchange. Next time, I will get him a better pair.

Lasted five months


Update:It's been five months and these suddenly stopped turning on.  I really loved them, so I'm super disappointed that they only lasted a short time.  I originally thought they had just ran out of batteries. They recharged just fine, and still wouldn't turn on. I opened it up expecting to find corrosion on the circuit board and nothing. I have no idea why they quit working. :-(I decided to go with an IPX8 and different brand instead. I think they're supposed to arrive today.My earbuds just arrived.First of all, I have very small ears and have ALWAYS had to switch the rubber pieces to the smallest ones. But, I didn't with these, the medium sized pieces are perfect.I paired them with my phone to test out the audio and distance. WOW!!! I put on a movie and the sound quality is amazing!! Great bass and not too much treble. My ears are sensitive to high pitch sounds.I set my phone on one side of my house and walked everywhere. My house is really big and there was zero interference with walls between my phone and me.I'll be testing it out in the shower tomorrow morning. But, the waterproof rating says it can go under 3 feet of water and still be fine. So, I don't foresee any issues. If there are issues, I'll add to this review. If there's nothing below that says ""Update"" you can safely assume wearing these in the shower went perfectly.I have two other pairs of Bluetooth earbuds by a different company and these blow those away in audio quality and comfort. These are about the same price as my others, maybe $10 more. But, absolutely worth it.Note: I chose these earbuds myself, the company didn't offer them to me for free or at a discount. This review is just me raving about a great product.

Takes some adjusting


When I first put the headphones on I thought they were going to be much too big to be useful. It didn't feel like I could get a secure fit on my ear. It took a few minutes of moving and twisting but once I found the right way to settle them they've been great. I went for a jog and they didn't dislodge even a little. I've worn them while cleaning and had no issues at all. It's a great product that just requires a bit of patience at first.

The sound quality is great BUT the part that hooks around your ear is too big even after trying to bend them to fit.... so it won't stay on my ears. I'm constantly adjusting them...and I haven't worn them to workout yet, this is just around the house to test them before I go to the gym. The packaging is nice, quality is nice but I had to give 3 stars because I will have to give them away to someone who has larger ears.

I bought these for myself, but my son liked how they looked and thought they looked better than the headphones I had bought him for Christmas, so these now belong to him.  He had told me that they stay on really well while he exercises and he cannot get over the sound quality.  So, they seem to be really good and now I'm going to have to buy myself another pair. I may just go ahead and buy one for my other son and my husband to decrease my chances of losing the next pair too.

At least 40 minutes listening without battery problem.  Before I purchase this product, i borrowed my friend Boss headset.  It was good for noise cancellation but I was getting too hot wearing.  This ear plug type is perfect for me.  Bluetooth is also working nicely.I lost my first one last month.  I bought my second set.  Meantime my wife also bought her own set.  This is good product to listen music.

Great sound, great customer service


I bought these in September 2017 and they sound great. Everything was fine until they quit working recently. I contacted the Senso customer service since they were still under the one year warranty based on the purchase date and I had the order number, which you can find in your archived purchases. I tried to reset them as advised to see if it was a Bluetooth issue, but that wasn't the case. I contacted them again and they made sure my address was correct and they quickly shipped a free replacement that I received in a couple of days. Since I have worked in retail before, I know great customer service when I experience it. I'm very happy with my experience. Thanks, Senso!

Sounds ok / minor problems/ not sure of cause


Sound was good. The bass sounded mushy rather than distinct. But good enough for me. It will take me a little time to get down the controls. I've accidentally started playing music without the Apple Music app being active by touching the volume buttons as I was putting it on. It was quite annoying because I had to open the app to stop it. Not sure what's going on there. Too early for a final review but here is the initial.

Not suitable for running...Floppy hooks!


Sounds are good.  Plenty of volume.  Several ""inserts"" to fit your ear.  The ""hoops"" are SO floppy that they don't stay in place very well when running.  Very annoying to continually be tweaking them to get them to stay in place.  If you're stationary, they're fine.  But if you expect to run in them, I'd look elsewhere.  Glad I only paid $35 for them.  I'm probably going to try and return them.

5 star so far!!!!


I just ordered and received these in mail 2 days ago.  I decided on these particular ear buds based on other reveiws, and for the time being im thoroughly impressed!!!! I did have a slight issue with registering my product, but when i sent an email regarding this issue they promplty registered it for me.  It pairs seamlessly with my samsung galaxy 7.  I haven't had a chance to run with it or do yard work yet ( still winter here in wisconsin!!!), and these are the main reasons I decided to go with Bluetooth earbuds, hence my reveiw title ""5 stars so far"".  They fit great, but I haven't worn them long enough to determine how they feel after a few hours.  Ill do a future update, once I've had enough time to use them,  but so far im very very happt with them......p.s. they have high quality sound and thumping base for the price.

Comfortable, flexible, and--yes-- rubbery!


You know how some electronic cords are higher quality than the cheap stuff? The better cords have a sort of rubbery, strong feeling. That's what these ear buds are like. In fact, the bands that fit around the ears are that same sort of rubbery, flexible and comfortable material. I use these buds exclusively now, my other pair, similarly styled but not as comfortable, remain an unused back-up. I bought these buds at full price from Amazon.

Decent head phones, but didn't last


I really liked the head phones while they lasted. Sound quality is good, they fit well and stayed in my ears, charged quickly and lasted a while. However the charger port in the R ear piece broke loose inside the unit at only 2 months old making them unable to be charged. I do use them 4 days a week in the gym, at work, and for hands free talking while driving, and changing every night, guess they just could hold up to the heavy use.

Quality has declined?


When first bought these headphones, I loved them (good sound, easy to use, decently long charge).  My first set last almost a year, which, for the price seemed reasonable. However, subsequent purchases have lasted less long (the next two lasted six months each, and my most recent set lasted only a couple of months). The problem is that the earphones stop working, and/or die early (despite being recently charged) and/or the functions (pause, skip track, turn on/off) stop working.  I'm sad, as I really liked these, but the short life is becoming frustrating and I will be buying another brand.

Although I have only used these earbuds for one day, I like the fit, the ease of use and the simplicity of pairing them with my iPhone 6.They performed as expected while I was on the elliptical but while on the driving range I noticed that they frequently cut out momentarily. This is not a huge issue for me as every pair of wireless earbuds I have owned has had the same issue. I'm hoping that as time goes on this problem will work itself out.

Like any new product, it has to be broken into. It sounded better after a few hours of play. Good, sturdy construction, and great packaging. I personally don't like hooks over the ears and a wire hanging behind my neck. The only reason I use it is workouts at the gym. They did not come off. Were intact the entire time. The sound is clear and crisp. But don't expect punchy bass. Very light weight. Never felt it was weighing down on me. At this price point it is a great buy !

Best earbuds on the market!


Had Amazon not offered such a painless return policy I would never have come to own this amazing product. These are my fourth set of wireless ear buds and are BY FAR the best I've ever owned. Very high volume, great bass, east to pair with both my i-Phone and my lap top and, most importantly - they are extremely comfortable and stay put. I use these daily during my workouts. Nothing makes me more aggravated during a set than my ear buds falling out. The past products I've had never stayed on, never sealed comfortably against my ear canal and after a while would hurt my ears.  These things can barely be felt. Totally comfortable, secure and easy to put on. I'm not a big review writer, but this product is more than worthy of praise. The company also offers tremendous customer service. I had a problem pairing them to my Mac Book Pro and contacted customer service. My problem was addressed in less than 24 hours with an easy to follow and effective fix to my issue. Best product on the market, especially for the price.

I am not an audiophile. These sound really good. My only qualm is that the part that goes in your ear that it came with, while pretty comfy, reminded me of earplugs. They had visible ear wax on them after about a week of use. I make a normal amount of ear wax, in case you're curious :) The ones I replaced them with really are not as comfortable.

Lost recharge ability; otherwise a great product


I purchased this awesome Bluetooth headphone back in February.  Unfortunately the device is not charging anymore.  If not for this issue, I would give a five star rating.  About to contact SENSO to hopefully get another one under their 1 year warranty offer.Since contacting Kimberly at SENSO customer support, I now give them a 5 star review.  She was extremely helpful and quick to reply.After going through the trouble shooting instructions (which, unfortunately, didn't fix the issue) a replacement has been shipped to me.  Thank you SENSO for making my experience with this issue quick and stress free...

Excellent Value and Performance


Excellent value and performance. I purchased these headphones because my wife works from home and I didn't want to disturb her.  I use these headphones to,listen to music and watch tv.  They work beautifully.  Pairing is a cinch and the packaging is also excellent.  The sound quality is very good.  Considering the price, you can't go wrong purchasing these headphones.  I would definitely recommend.

Great for phone conversation. Sound is clear for me and the person at the other side of the line. Playing music, it makes the job, not an amazing sound, bur good enough for training time. Actually a good product with a low price.Today i’ve changed the eartips, and sound is awesome, deep and clear bass, mid and high frequencies are crystal clear. I rated this product with 4 stars, now I think it deserves 5.Now I have a problem with the microphone, the sound at the other side of the line is not clear and with a lot of noise.I need to contact the seller, by email or something like that

Good quality


Arrived on time. Work great, pairs easily. Sound is really good! It does block out most noise. They fit better than my last pair. I adjust them way less when I'm running/at the gym. They do not slip either. I did not rate the battery life, only because I've had them about a week. I also haven't lost signal with them yet, took a little bit to pair this morning at the gym, but nothing to serious. Overall good product for the price.

Stupid ""Battery low"" voice at 30% every 5 minutes.


The sound is great and the battery life is great, but the only thing that is the most annoying thing about these earbuds is when it reaches 30%, every 5 minutes it has a loud voice that says battery low. Not sure if this can be turned off but it is a stupid feature. It also means the earbuds are about to turn off when it reaches 30%. Seems that it miscalculates the battery time.

Sound quality is better than expected.


Can’t beat the price. My first wireless headphones. The ear attachments could be more durable. I spend too much time adjusting to fit just right. I use them during my gym workout. I wear glasses, which also contributes to a poorer fit. Overall though, I like them and will use until they wear out.

Cheap product


I just don't think these sound very good. Also, the Bluetooth connection gets kind of choppy and will go through stretches where it cuts out about 4 or 5 times in a few seconds. That happens every few minutes when I use these. I use three different Bluetooth speakers and have used four different wired earbuds on my phone, and these are the only ones that sound bad enough for me to have to go into the phone's equilizer and try to tweak it to make it sound decent. Even after tweaking they still don't sound as good as stock earbuds.

I made the mistake of ordering these a few weeks before I joined the gym.  Now that I'm using them, I find that I do not like them.  They do not stay on my ears.  Several times during my workout (walking on a treadmill) they fall off.  The fit is terrible, so I don't hear the music very well.  But it's too late to return them.  Now I begin the search for a better product.

Good warranty and does what it says it does


Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend who is very picky when it comes to Bluetooth headsets. A lot of research went into choosing this brand and they did not disappoint. Not only did my boyfriend rave about the performance of these headphones, the company actually provides reliable support for their warranty. After heavily using the headsets for approximately 9 months, one of the earpieces began shorting. I got a prompt response from a representative who gave me troubleshooting tips after which they accepted full responsibility for the issue being experienced and sent a replacement.

There are amazing for the price.  Buying earbuds online is a trick and the best info are the reviews and knowing if you like  the bass, voice or melody  parts of music.  These are mid range headphones very good for audio books less good for the bottom thud of say movie music.  Great how they fit, adjust and stay in your ear.  If you have bought a few paris in your life here is a key.  The cord is a perfect length and durable.  A great buy.

The sound is fine (not great, but fine), however the quality of the product itself is very very poor. In the one year that I've had these, I have had to order replacements 4 times...the warranty is now up so, that's the end of my run with senso. I can say that their customer service was prompt, and they always sent out replacements without question when my headphones would break. that's worth two stars for sure. i definitely would not reccommend these headphones though

I was really happy with these headphones and used them for about two months until they would no longer turn on or charge.

I've had a number of bluetooth headphones and was never fully satisfied. Some were uncomfortable. Others had short/poor battery life. And still others had a 1-3 second delay in voice transmission when trying to watch TV without disturbing others in the house.

almost sound like a scratched CD


For the price the headphones are okay I guess. They stay in place when running but they do cut out, almost sound like a scratched CD. I thought at first it was because my phone was too far away but when running I keep my phone on my arm with a workout band so I don't think that's the issue. They serve their purpose. The only really bad thing I would say is that they came with the wrong charger- which was really weird. These literally came with an iPhone like charger even though they have the port of an Android. Luckily I have extra Android chargers so I didn't see the need to return them.I would say if you can afford better, spend more, but if you just need something to make due these are a good choice.

Physician recommended, tested, and approved.


TL;DR - Just buy them.Senso... never heard of them.  In fact, I'd never have bought a set of earbuds from this company had it not been for my wife who took a chance on a rather inexpensive Christmas gift.Best. Earbuds. Ever.For the price, this is an absolute steal.AUDIO:  The audio quality, which is excellent for a set of earbuds, out-performs my wired Bose earbuds and only underperformed in the lower pitches (as a physician, no set of earbuds is safe if they have good bass - no room for the sound waves to escape and only damage your middle ear).  I wouldn't use these earbuds to record audio (I do podcasts and digital recording), but I wouldn't recommend ANY earbuds for that.COMFORT:  I hate earbuds.  They HURT.  The only set I can use for any extended period of time (on an airplane, for example) is my Bose earbuds.  However, Senso's set is a close second and doesn't seem to cause the residual pain other sets (Apple) causes.NOISE CANCELLATION:  I'm not certain how the noise cancellation works... I believe it's passive.  Nevertheless, I have an Autistic daughter that only I seem to be able to calm and when she's screaming, I can plug these earbuds in and drown out her painful screams without completely drowning out all noise. When I'm playing music, it really does seem to work better than my Bose earbuds.  I'm not sure how it works, but it does.VALUE:  How is this possible?!  HOW?!  This set came with two charging cords (one micro USB and ONE WITH A CONVERTING LIGHTNING/MICRO USB!!!), a car charger with TWO PORTS (1.0A and 2.1A!), replacement ear pieces, and a hard clamshell case.  Did I mention it was only $30?!The closest to this I can find on Amazon is a similar set (eerily identical) by Blayz (RobinTronics is missing several items [car charger]).  HOWEVER, that set does not come with a convertible Lightning/Micro USB cord and, while it is currently $3-4 cheaper, this cord more than makes up for it.CONCLUSION:  FIVE STARS -- If you want a decent set of earbuds, get this one now.  It is well worth it.

Not Good For Narrow Ear Canals


Nice features but not good for people with narrow ear canals.  I have very narrow ear canals, so even the smallest tip won't stay inserted in my ears.  If the tips won't stay inserted, then not only do you not get the noise-isolation feature, but you also won't get any bass.  Unlike, say, the earbuds that come with an iPhone, these have to create a seal with the ear canal in order to produce any bass.

I got these on 12-20-17 and didn't need to charge them until 12-25-17 with 5-6 hours a day continuous use, that's pretty dang impressive.

I love these headphones!  The sound is very high quality and the volume and on and off switches are intuitive to use.  Ordinary earbuds don't stay in my ears, but with the over-the-ear flexible plastic piece, I have no trouble keeping them where they belong.

Add to cart and hit buy, don't even read the review.


First I was afraid, I was petrified. No not really. After those apple headphones you get when you buy an iPhone kept falling out of my ear when on any cardio machine, I said forget this nonsense. Next move, amazon and hit bluetooth headphones  > sort 5 stars and SENSO appeared like a mirage. Took a gamble, added to cart and the rest is history. I have been using this headphone for 3 weeks solid at the gym and it's solid, it's clear, it's totally worth it. This headphone is your perfect gym companion. Heavy sweater? No problem, Senso is like sensei guiding you to finishing your required 30 minutes of cardio. Hit the buy, you won't be disappointed. Don't waste your money on those high end headphones. Use that money you saved for a post gym burrito or burger.

If you are looking for great noise cancellation, this is not it. But if you are looking for a portable bluetooth earbud for a light workout, this would be perfect.

Great headphones for the gym!


Great for the gym because I can move freely away from my phone and still follow the workout videos I use. I don't like that once it gets close to running out of battery it starts repeating ""battery low"" every minute until it dies. I had to get different headphones for more every day use, but I'll continue using these for the gym. They're also a little difficult to wear with glasses, but it doesn't bother me too much.I've had some difficulties getting it to connect smoothly via Bluetooth on my devices. I've found that removing it from my Bluetooth settings and then adding it on again solves the issue but I've had to do it a few times.

Great For Serious Runners


These were purchased for me as a gift and work wonderfully for running. I am a serious marathoner and use the headphones for running easy, hard workouts, or long runs. The headphones stay seated in my ears and sound great even with all of the movement.  I am very sensitive to changes in my running gear, therefore, I was concerned about the cord irritating and bouncing on my neck and shoulders, but this has not been an issue. I don't even notice the cord when I run.The only reason I gave 4 stars for the material quality is the cord clip to adjust the tightness between the headphones detached and is lost.The battery life is awesome and lasts as long as the manufacturer states.

So far so good


Thus far, after a few runs, all is well. They come with several sizes of buds to accommodate most including a pair of foam (I'm assuming more of the noise canceling type). The loop is a bit large which means that it doesn't fit as snugly as I'd prefer when running but if that's the greatest issue they're pretty good. I've not had the pleasure of running in the rain with them yet to test their water rating but sweat has done nothing so far. I also like that they came with a clip to hook the cord to my shirt to shorten it up.

I sweat like crazy and have had no issues at this time with sweat.My only concern right now is the right earbud is heating up to where it is noticeably warm in my ear and to the touch.

WOW! AMAZING! Heres Why.


I kid you not, these sound better then my power beats 3. The fact that I payed 36$ is crazy! Let me just say, this product doesnt feel premium as you would with other high end brands (beats, jaybirds, b&o, etc...). The cable feels to ""everywhere"", like ""spaghetti strings"". And the hook around the ear also feels very everywhere as well. It should have been a more firm grip and more customized fit as the (my) powerbeats do. If Senso can fix those issues and make the product more premium, Im not even kidding, but I'll be more then welcome to pay over 130$ for these. Im giving this product 5 stars because I payed less then $40 and because they sound awesome! Regardless if they do have that almost cheap feel to it. Also I thought the car charger it came with was funny, it had this metal look alike part to it, I thought it was legit solid metal but its plastic lol. Hopefully this review was thorough and well made. Also I hope SENSO sees this to know what to do with there future projects for this product.

Former PowerBeats2 owner. Lost them & DID NOT want to spend another $100. Saw these had great reviews so I decided to go for it. So far, so good. Compared to my beats, I can tell the SENSO has a cord with lesser quality BUT it’s not a dealbreaker at all. Really, the only issue I’ve experienced with the SENSO headphones would be the microphone. When I am on the phone, they can never hear me bc the microphone is at the bottom of the ear piece instead of on the cord near my mouth. Usually I have to speak loudly when talking on the phone, but again, not a dealbreaker.

I am on my second set of headphones, not through any fault of the headphones. I was getting out of the car and they got caught in the door, the charging mechanism was crushed though they did still work until the battery died. They work well and have good battery life. I bought 2 pairs to replace that one so I will have them if I make another mistake. The new ones have a slightly different over ear piece though they are the same model. That being said it seems comfortable and the sound quality is just as good as the last pair!! I would definitely recommend these headphones!

I was excited to get these headphones but upon wearing them they are entirely too large for my ears and I don't have small ears. The loop part that goes around your ear doesn't even touch my ear and the smallest bud doesn't fit in my ear canal. I'm very disappointed as they seemed so promising.

this headphone is roughly 10$ more than most other adverage devices, but the value is so much more.the sound is incredible, however it is a little lacking in bass...but for 30$ it sounds so so so much better than other devices that cost around 17-22$.

Good fit, noise cancelling is a bit much


I bought these for my wife and she says they're great:-Fits well and don't fall out while running-Sound quality is good-Don't need to keep adjusting while running-Controls are intuitiveShe also said the noise-cancelling feature is a bit too much, sometimes making her nervous that she can't adequately hear her surroundings.

Great comfortable noise cancellation headphones


This headphones surpassed my expectations given what I paid for them. They fit well in my ear: works better with the connecting cable placed in front and under the chin instead of the back of the neck).It does cancel noise completely so that is something to keep in mind when buying this product. Sound is not top notch but it is definitely not bad at all. I like the design and look of it.It is also very practical with up and down volume setters and a function to click on the right side piece once to pause sound.Overall exceptional product for the price!!!

They are super comfortable. Never even come close to coming out


They are super comfortable.  Never even come close to coming out.  Pairs with my iPhone 6 and iPad Pro very easily.  Nice sound too!!  Only issue I have been having is it breaking up when playing music when phone is only in my pocket.  So that does suck.  But only when using my iPhone 6 which i can't be sure isn't the problem since it needs an upgrade.  I also just did a factory reset on headset as I read that can help.  So here's hoping tonight at the gym I have uninterrupted music since they truly are beyond comfortable

Poor fit


The sound quality was better than expected and the earbuds are relatively user-friendly. Wind noise during runs was noticeable but not a deal-breaker.Speaking of deal-breakers ... they are difficult to get onto my ears and do not fit my ears snuggly. During my workouts, they shift frequently and fall off occasionally - I ended up trying to pin the plastic arms under my sunglasses temples to hold them in place. For me, they are too bulky, which may be part of the reason they don't stay put.The inconvenience of fitting them onto my ears, along with their tendency to move around during wear, means that these earbuds are being returned.

Overall excellent value. Really pleased. Sound quality ok.


For they money you get a lot here. Easy to set up. Listen time is strong and buds are comfortable. That all said the sound quality isn't great. It's good but they lack a decent bass note and even when I change EQ on phone it doesn't help. Would not compare them to noise cancelling devices I typically use on the plane. I'll use these when outside and save my Bose for air travel.

I can honestly say that the sound quality of these are just as good, if not better than any of my Beats


I am very hard on headphones and I have have 3 pair of ""Beats"" similar to these. I can honestly say that the sound quality of these are just as good, if not better than any of my Beats. There really isn't much of a comparison on the bass. These Senso's are much better there!  Also, they come with a set of noice canceling ear bud covers, which is awesome! I have only been using these headphones for about 2 weeks. So, only time will tell about the wear. I can honestly say, save your money and buy these instead of ""Beats""

Great product. Phenomenal support


All I can say is Wow! Since purchasing these headphones in May, they have been my Go To headphones. I wear them every day, all day, until they need recharging and I sadly have to switch to a different pair while the Senso recharge. Recently, the Sensos developed a pairing problem.  Would not pair with phone or laptop. I was bummed. After a couple of emails with Senso support, who were incredibly responsive, it was determined there was a problem with the headphones. I offered to return them. Instead, they sent me a brand new pair in less than four days and just in time for a 8 hour plane ride! Great product. Phenomenal support! Senso, you have a customer for life! Thank you!

the sound quality was terrible. The bass drown out the actual music


These were my first set of wireless earbuds and i wasnt impressed. After all the 4/5 star reviews i thought id give them a try and wasnt impressed at all. First off, the wires are way too long, who needs 4 feet between headphones? So i could either tuck them in my shirt or let them get caught everywhere. Secondly, the sound quality was terrible. The bass drown out the actual music. My wired earbuds are way better. Now ill be on the search for something more adequate. I suppose for the money these will do but not for me.

They were easy to pair with my iPhone


Received today, and overall, I’d buy them again. They were easy to pair with my iPhone, and they’re very comfortable. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that the part that loops over the ear seems to be really big and it’s not adjustable. I was hoping for a slightly tighter fit. The sound quality is good and they’re easy to use. I only use these to exercise, so I can’t speak to phone call quality.

Highly recommended.


I bought my son two sets of Philips wireless earbuds. The first set stopped working after two weeks. The second set kept disconnecting from his phone. I did some research and saw the good reviews of the SENSO headphones so I thought I'd give them a try. He uses them every day and loves them. Great sound, strong signal, never disconnects from his phone. We actually had to buy two sets because the first one was chewed up by the dog, and haven't had a problem with either.

I'm not the most technically intuitive person but I could not get my headphones to pair with my Mac-book air.  They paired easily with my I-Phone and the sound is great.  I'll just need two sets of earphones for my devices.  That's a little disappointing but I'm not sorry I bought these.

These headphones sync pretty well and fit great!  I did have an issue with the sound seeming distant when syncing with the PC.  However, the next day, without doing anything differently, the sound was perfect.The sound does sound good when connected via the iPhone 7 Plus which is the main reason I got it.I was able to test the mic on a call and the person on the other end said I sounded good.

Best earbuds ever!!


The best I've tried: 1. Way louder than necessary volume. 2. short recharge time. 3.quick pairing. 4. Very comfortable.The overear hooks really help. 5. Long playing. 6. No unnecessary weightier object on in-between wire whose swinging could cause earbud to dislodge from ear; they stay in place. 7. Very little build up of lag time between video and audio streaming.8. Awesome audio frequency response on high and low end. I can't find anything wrong with them, maybe wish volume could be muted more, the source can be muted also, anyway, and I like the extra power if necessary.9. Excellent go-the-extra-mile accessories, including a case which actually is small and protective. 10. Range from source is good or better than others. 11. And did I say they look cool?

Short Life Span


I purchased this product in the beginning of January 2018.  The sound quality was good and the fit was nice?  I sweat A LOT when I exercise, but the buds stayed in place.  The cord would stick to my neck at times, while running, and eventually would tug off one of the buds - oh well.The reason that I'm giving this product two stars is because recently the headphones would die after only 2 to 3 hours of use.  Today they completely died on me while at the gym 5/8/2018.  I only got 4 months use  out of these headphones.  SMH.

MUFFLED SOUNDBUT music sounds absolutely terrible. Muffled beyond belief. Its like you put cotton balls in your ear and then put mediocre earphones in after. Stay away if you want to listen to anything other than talk programs.It is true that it is very comfortable. Even more comfortable than Bose in-ear headphones. But ignore my previous warning at your own risk. Who wants to deal with the hassle of a return? I thought I did, but still have not got around to it. I wish someone would combine the comfort of this design with higher quality sound.

I'm not so hot on these. The loops are too big for my ears so I can't get them to sit right. And I can't wear them anywhere that other Bluetooths are broadcasting because it tries to pick up everyone. Out in the middle of nowhere they work great, but at the gym or on campus it is like listening to a skipping record. I actually bought a different pair as soon as I saw a good deal.

Great headphones at the price point


The product is exactly as advertised and came with all the accessories necessary. The included charging cable with a lightning/micro USB head is very thoughtful , convenient, and useful. I'm leaving it in my car so passengers can use it whether they have an iPhone or a phone with a micro USB port. The ear buds fit in my ears perfectly and don't fall out while walking/running. Only thing that I don't like is how the LED indicator is a bit small. But you'll get over it once you get used to the power on/off mechanism and pairing. The sound Quality is definitely an upgrade to iPhone headphones and this will be future proof if I decide to go to a headphone jack less phone without dealing with a dongle.

Worked well...a few times...


When I first used these, I was very happy with the quality--especially for the price.  But after about 5 uses now, I am not as pleased. I mainly use them when I walk my dog outside and for running--I love the fit, and they do not fall off of my ears even when I run.  However, after the first few uses, the sound has started to cut out regularly.  Even after fully charged, they connect just fine, but when I am listening to music they cut out and back in.  I have tried them with a different device to make sure it was not just my phone, and they do the same thing.  I will likely be purchasing some higher quality ones instead.

Not good for cycling


These are a little chunky and plastic, but if they worked well it would be overlooked. In this case, they do not work for cycling as the wind nose renders them unusable. It sounds like someone is blowing in to the microphone and drowns out whatever you're listening to. Also, the controls are not easy to use with gloves.

I own a pair of the  Sol Republic that I paid almost 3 times more for. While they do sound great they were no good for heavy exercise. I came across these while looking for workout headphones. They are perfect for working out, as they move very little and sound just as good as the Sol Republics do. The functions are much easier to use and the fit perfect. These rival any of the more expensive headphones for less.

After two weeks, these seem to be a good deal for the price I paid (bought them on sale). The case they come with is just a little too small I think which has lead to the headphones turning on by themselves a few times. Now that I'm aware of the problem, I haven't had any repeats.

Not worth any hype or you money, pay more for better.


I do not know what the hype is for these headphones.  While there is no background hiss, there is a mostly muddled over bass heavy sound that really misses out on clarity. I'm glad they are just for the gym and not my main listening device.Weirdly they supplied a lighning cable inside and not a mini usb cable which is what is actually needed.  Lucky it came with the short cable also.Connecting it up was OK, plenty of choice for ear pieces, but not that comfy really.  They are OK but not super comfy like I am always hoping for from headphones.Overall, I am left with a sense of disappointment based on the sound quality.  I would not recommend these

Dre Powerbeats 2 Wireless In‑Ear Headphones because they were the best wireless earbuds as some suggested


I used to have the Beats by Dr. Dre Powerbeats 2 Wireless In‑Ear Headphones because they were the best wireless earbuds as some suggested, and yes, I totally agree with them. I only bought these because I misplaced the beats so I need a substitute pair. The price of these looks way cheaper than the original price of $160. But honestly, they are really worth $40 with the low sound and texture qualities. If you don't care about the sound quality and just want something cheap for gym; or something that you don't mind losing, these are absolutely the best for you as they come with bunch of other charging supplies in the box.

Poor performance while walking.


These worked great for me when I was sitting at my desk and tried them out initially.  When I got a chance to use them for a daily walk I ran into all kinds of dropouts and choppiness.  I have a Samgung Note 5 and play music with Spotify and use the Zombie's Run to motivate my exercise.  These headphones stutter and drop out constantly.  I thought it was a bad network connection so I turned off my wireless  and that didn't help at allWhen I plug in wired headphones everything is OK.I wish I had found this out before the return-period had passed.  Now I'm stuck with them.  Glad I bought them on sale.

No more cords!


I bought these after seeing all the positive reviews.  I was looking for a good inexpensive set of bluetooth earbuds with mic.  Although the over the ear rubber seems too loose and can fall out, I have not had that happen yet.  The fit in the ear is very comfortable, and I feel as if I could wear these for a couple hours without any discomfort.  The sounds is amazing!  It is very clear, and it is clear when on a phone call as well (both for me and the person on the other side...a big criticism of other bluetooth earpieces).The only this I have had happen that I didn't like is that the cable connecting the earpiece sometimes gets caught in my shirt, causing the earbuds to dislodge from my ear.  However, this is still far better than having the cord connected to the phone!The company had great communication with me after the purchase and made sure the product was to my satisfaction.  This is a great product!

1. After 20-30 minutes they become uncomfortable2. The loop (behind the ear) that holds the earbuds is somewhat flimsy, when the back of the wire (even with the smart clip) gets stuck due to turning the head, the ear loop gets pulled off.3. The sound quality is inferior.4. The headphones arrived and same day an email from vendor asked for a 5 star feedback.Would not recommend them.

If you tire of having them in your ears, they will not stay on your neck, you need to have somewhere to put them.Have had several complaints of people being able to hear themselves during a phone conversation.  To the point, I have to turn off the blue tooth function and use just the phone during phone conversations.  Inconvenient for both party's.

No voice dial ability


I chose this product to replace the one I had purchased two years ago that served me well until I closed my car door on it. I replaced it with the same model however upon receiving the newer version, it did not voice dial. I thought that was poor marketing. They were both the same S250 model. I have since then sent it back for a refund and bought a more advanced model.

For a little money a lot of ear buds


These are really very good for the money.  I wear them in the gym and on the trail. They stay in, sweat and motion doesn't bother them. The instructions say not to charge them over night, but I do almost constantly and they still work. They're easy to turn on and off and they pair instantly with my Apple Watch 4. Its also easy answer phone calls.

Best headphones I've ever had!!!


These are amazing! They are a gift for my husband for Christmas, but I wanted to try them out first. They are beyond comfortable for my ears. I have tiny ears and struggle with finding ear buds that don't hurt my ears. These are the perfect fit! The sound is amazing too. I had the TV on (fairly loud too) and I couldn't hear it over the headphones (even at a lower volumn). I'm contemplating getting another pair for myself (or stealing his lol)

Would've been 4 stars if they lasted.


Sound- Comparable to Beats.Fit- In ear fit was great. Over ear hook was very loose. Still, stayed on during running.Wouldn't adjust volume on my Galaxy S8, or let me answer calls. Meh, annoying but not deal-breaker.Cost-effective alternative to Beats, but after 2 months the earphone completely broke off. Since I can't be sure how it happened I don't want to leave 1 star, but still seems like I didn't get $30 worth of wear.

INCLUDES A TON OF S**T!


These are awesome earbuds with a great ""boost"" effect that makes the sound more immersive. The actual buds are earplug-type material so the sound-cancelling in pretty good. The hooks are flexible so don't expect them to break off any time soon. The range is as good as my Sodrop 2.0 headphones. I went downstairs to my garage and it STILL maintained perfect sound quality. But that's because it was only the floor separating. If you went 2-3 rooms away from your device, since there are so many walls, the sound may become glitchy. The BEST part about these earbuds is that the battery life is very good and it comes with:1.) Wire Lock2.) Car Charger3.) 3ft micro usb/iphone charger4.) Travel Case5.) Short backup micro usb wire6.) And of course, different sized eartips

Good Headphones


These headphones have good sound and I really like not being tethered to my iPhone when I walk. They easily paired with my phone. Only down side is that, because the weather is cold now, I always wear a close-fitting toboggan hat when I walk, and these earphones stick out, so that it makes my ears very uncomfortable wearing a hat. I have had to go back to my wired headphones for now, but will return to wearing the Sensos when a hat is no longer required.

These are excellent.  Comfortable with decent sound quality.  I use them to run, they are stable and fit well. Pairing is easy, daily on and off and pairing, easy.

I synced the earbuds to my TomTom Spark and could not get a good quality, non interference connection. I even switch the watch from my left to right wrist thinking it would help, which it did slightly. So far not impressed. Tried connecting to the computer to see about a software update, but no luck there either. Not sure if it's just the TomTom Spark but I'm not trading in the watch because of the earbuds.

Doesn't adjust to your ear


Didnt care for the ear piece that goes over your ear. It's just flimsy rubber. So unless your ear is already that size you can't adjust it at all. Most of these have an adjustable wire in that piece so you can move it to fit your ear. These just kept fall off of me. Plus I'm mad they took out 10 dollars to ship it back. ***update*** My refund is 23something and I paid 36. Where did the 13 dollars go?

I had originally ordered a pair of Phaiser BHS-730 and at first loved them.  However, after I started running they kept hitting against my body which created a lot of noise.  Additionally, they are heavy.  Long story short, I returned them and purchased these Senso which are half of the weight. They fit perfect, are super light, comfortable, and pair perfect with my G3 Bluetooth watch!  Much better product!!!

As much as he loved the 1st pair, he actually likes these even better because it comes with an additional pair of foam  buds (the part that goes in your ear) that compress and expand to fit your ear perfectly.  His exact words were ""the inner ear gription is top notch.""  He also loves that they connect to both his personal phone and work phone at the same time.

Very short critical battery warning


Overall, decent for the price. Limited features, but not unreasonable for the price. Battery usually good for several hours. Biggest disappointment is that the only way to know the battery is getting low is when the intrinsic voice notifies you, and that's literally thirty seconds before they die. If you don't have backups, be ready to finish up your workout like right now.

Great headphones for the money spent.


I just opened and started listening. First I can tell by the packaging that the creators take their product seriously. For then being $20 I expected them to be in a bag or something. Boxed well and came with other goodies I didn’t expect. The sound so far is good, bass is a little weak but they do well. I’ve never owned noise canceling headphones before so I don’t have anything to compare them too but I don’t think I’d hear someone talking next to me with them in.

I wasn't feeling these buds, at all. I was going to return them. However, I found that replacing the ear pads with a pair from a different pair of earbuds that I was using made all the difference in the world. Plenty of bass, plenty of highs and spatial sound. It's really all about the fit. If you can find ear pads that fit your ear canals, well, you will not be disappointed.

I have had these wireless Bluetooth ear buds for 2 weeks now and they have very crisp, clear, louder than most for sound. The only thing so far that I find disappointing is the distance range that they lack; it seems less than 20ft from where my phone is set down. It is a little bit of a inconvenience if I need to walk 21 ft from my phone, the buds will beep out and ""hibernate"" until I walk over to my phone and hit the play button again, they will not automatically play again until this is done. Otherwise they are very comfortable to wear and do not fall out of my ears like most do (even my bose for high impact sports & runners fall out) when I am doing high activities such as running, jumping, etc.

These headphones are a fantastic value and from what I have found the best battery life on Bluetooth wireless headphones for under $40, you cannot beat these no pun intended when you pair the price, quality, and customer service. I have use these headphones now for about 9 months, and they were used heavily. And itafter all that time and the thousands of hours of podcasts one of the ears actually died on me but with this company their customer service was so prompt and all they did was make sure I actually ordered the headset and sent me a new one no problem.Long story short, you are not going to find better headphones for the price, quality, and awesome battery life I can confirm it is upwards of eight hours and the sound quality is superb especially for the value. Do not waste your money on crazy high-end Bluetooth headphones When these headphones do more justice.

Works well for the most part but there are some major connectivity issues at times. Like riding a bike the audio will constantly cut out. If you cup your hand over your right earpiece it will cut out completely until you remove it. I cant connect it to my computer without any major major lag and inconsistency with the audio. Cant replace it seeing how there is no option to do so. Maybe there is a bait and switch going on here selling defective products.

The sound quality is good and the range is pretty far


These headphones are alright during weight training. The piece that goes over your ear is too flimsy so sometimes they'll fall off your ear. Also for some reason when I initially pair them, they make this skipping sound when I play the first song. It last for 5-10 seconds and then plays normally.The sound quality is good and the range is pretty far. The good thing about these headphones is that I can put my phone in my pocket and it won't skip.I took a star off because of the backing of the ear is too flimsy.If these headphones broke I wouldn't buy them again.

Great headphones, phone call audio needs work


I have has these headphones for about a week as a way to he able to listen to music while charging my phone with my iPhone 7 and also to be able to better ignore my roommate. So far these headphones have been great only two things keeping them from being 5 stars. One is the fact that although audio with movies and music is great the audio when doing phone calls and quality of the Microphone is far below par sounding pixelated and hard to hear for both parties. The other is that for me personally although it could just be i need more time to adjust to them they hurt your ears after awhile of wearing not the same as the entrance to your ear hurting like other headphone more along the top of your ears like the weight of them takes some getting used to. But that could just be me. All in all great headphones and great for the price if they fix the way the audio sounds on a phone call then it would be 5/5 stars but I would recommend these to anyone who was looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones for working out for a good price

Great battery life, never fall out


This is really 4.8 stars, I've had these for over 6 months with only a minor quibble. My last bluetooth headphones warned of low battery about 45 minutes before powering off, but they had shorter battery life and fell out frequently during workouts. The Senso are great -- sound is fine, they never fall out, the battery life is long. But the low battery warning is only 5 minutes before they turn off. Previously, I could confidently go to the gym knowing the battery would last the entire workout as long as the low power warning had not sounded before I left the house. With Senso I have to pay too much attention to how long its been since the last charge, or charge more often whether it needs it or not.

I love these headphones and have bought them twice now. However, right around the 3 month mark, something always happens to them. The first time, the entire earbud actually fell out of the headphones, exposing the wire. The second time, a large amount of feedback started and the headphones started to overheat to the point where I couldn't wear them without risk of burning! These are great short-term headphones, but if you're looking for something more long term, I don't know if I would recommend.

They didn't bounce around or come loose and the small connecting cable on the back of my neck didn't noticeably bounce around and irritate me. The sound quality and volume is pretty good.

I was surprised to find by pushing the button on the right earbud you can cycle thru the last number dialed, the music on your device and another Bluetooth option.  I’m very glad that I got these and not another set!

Best customer service possible ...


Best Customer Service EVER ....I have two of these headphones that I bought in April 2017 - and I LOVE them.Recently one of them had a minor problem in one of the buds and I reached out to Tekatron.Even though it was a weekend they replied withing a few hours; suggested a few things that might fix it and when those suggestions did not solve the problem, on their own said they would ship a replacement pair - I did not even have to ask them to do it.I would buy this product without any hesitation because it is a great product (very good sound and very hardy) and because it is supported by a great company.I wish them great success.

Worked perfectly for 6 months


I bought these July 2017 because I needed a Bluetooth headphone I can use to talk on the phone.  These worked great at first.  They deliver nice sound and stay in my ears while running, but by January 2018 the microphone in the headphones no longer worked.  I could hear the caller on the other end, but they could not hear me.  You get what you pay for.

Headphones worked fine until 2nd night when plugging the charge cord into the port to power up.  The port mechanism loosened and disappeared into the earpiece.  Returning for a replacement.

I don't know but its rather annoying. But he likes them


I ordered these for myself.  Old school I guess but tired of having to charge it and just bought a different connection to hook up earphones to my iPhone.  No need to charge anything.  So I gave these away as a gift to a friend.  He loves them but when I talk to him while he is on them I hear myself 'repeating'  through the phone which is annoying.  Maybe he has his volume up to loud.  But he likes them!

Terrible Sound Quality


Pros: Seem well built; all the buttons operate well and as advertised, and the voice confirmation is a nice feature.  I also like that they connect to my iPhone 7 Plus easily.Cons: 1. The sound quality is absolutely terrible and quite muddy and makes all my music sound like it’s being played in a closet.  None of the equalizer settings in my phone are able to overcome the poor sound.  The setting that improves it the best is called “Bass Reducer”.  I honestly don’t know where all the 5-star ratings are coming from(?). I tried resetting the headphones as the company recommended but that didn’t work.  The sound quality is my biggest complaint.2. When running, the wind noise is picked up by the microphone and amplifies it, I think.  It sounds like I’m sticking my head out of a car window at 40 MPH…while trying to hear my music.3. They wiggle loose in my ears when I’m running (I bought them specifically for running) and I constantly have to keep jamming them back in which is annoying.4. The flat silicone cable connecting the two sides sticks to my skin and/or shirt so if I turn my head, the wire gets pulled to one side and when I turn my head back or to the other side, the wire stays put and pulls on one of my ears so I have to continually reach around my neck to center the wire.  This is a pain.  They give you a little rubber clip to cinch the cord up but that doesn’t work at all because the cable came mal-formed in the box and the permanent twists in the flat cable prevent the clip from staying on.  I could try another way to hold the wire off my neck but I hate these headphones so much, I’m probably just going to toss them.5. Lastly, when I put my hand to the right earbud to operate the buttons, it seems to interfere with the Bluetooth signal and the music cuts out while my hand is near the headphones.This was my first pair of BT headphones and I chose them based on all the 5-star ratings.  Now I don't know what to do since Apple appears to be forcing its users to use BT headphones over the wired ones.  By the way, my $30 pair of Sony wired headphones is my go-to favorite but since the last iOS update, they no longer work...  Good luck.

Better than expected at this price point


I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. I was looking for an inexpensive pair of wireless headphones for use at gym and during yard work. These fit the bill. The depth of sound lacks a little compared to higher end brands but overall the sound quality is satisfactory. Nice fit and design. Purchase came with case , car charge adapter two cables long and short.  I will mention at the gym with phone in pocket I have on occasion heard static when I remove phone from pocket it goes away.  I will have to see how this goes. Loving forward as I have only used them a few times. Over all satisfied.

Good Headphones, well worth the price.


The sound is excellent, these are the most comfortable earphones I've worn, battery holds quite long, well-made quality product with a lovely case and wire accessories.  The only minor shortcoming I can report is that the Bluetooth function is a little weak, i.e., I can't stray too far from my smartphone when I loose contact (max 10-12 feet in a straight line).  That aside, I would purchase these again and would highly recommend.

Great for music, but not for talking on the phone


Been using these for a few months now. I get about 1 week on the battery life, using it about 1 hour a day. Great for listening to music while working out at the gym or running, the sound quality is not like a top-tier headphone but it is very good considering the price. It actually blocks outside noise really well. My only complaint is that the microphone does not pick my voice well, especially in a noise environment like a gym. If you try to have a phone conversation with it, the other person may have a hard time understanding everything.  But I still give this a 5/5.

These have worked where many I've tried have failed. I'm still using them at home and at the gym with no issues. They actually appear to be sweat proof and are not totally noise cancelling, so you can hear a little while running. They fit well and don't fatigue my ears after an hour of wear, I don't wear them much longer than that so I don't know if they would after a longer period of time.

A decent buy


I bought these headphones for working out because I was tired of putting the apple headphones back into my ears constantly while at the gym. They were easy to setup and I also haven't had any issues with taking phone calls with them. The sound is good and when they are turned all the way up, the sound is still nice and clear.  I waited to give my review because I wanted to see how they held up. I purchased them in january, 2017. There seems to be a short in the left earbud, which is frustrating when I'm trying to listen to music, podcasts, etc. These were a good buy for what I paid but I do wish they were a little more durable. UPDATE. I contacted invotek with my issues and they responded very quickly. They confirmed my address and I will be receiving new headphones in a few days. I hope the new pair is more durable but I can give them 5 stars just for their customer service.

Useless after 12 months


I purchased the wireless headphone in April 2018.  The product worked well until earlier this month (May 2019), when the left side no longer played audio.I contacted Senso’s customer service, who instructed me to perform a factory reset.  I do so several times; however, the left side still didn’t sync or play audio.Senso informed me that it has been 12 months since I purchased their product, so they couldn’t provide a replacement.  I was provided a 5% (five percent) discount code for purchasing another set of Senso headphones instead, so that’s something..

Suddenly stopped powering on


As I have seen with many others my ears too are  small and I’ve always had a problem with ear  buds. I was happy that these not only fit comfortably but actually stayed in during workouts.  Sound quality was also pretty good and overall I was happy with the purchase until they suddenly stopped powering on.  I’ve kept them in their case, I’ve never gotten them wet and they weren’t even used that often. There is no explanation for why they suddenly stopped working.  Initially I thought the battery was just dead but during the last few times of trying to charge them, the blue light appeared as if they were charging but nothing would power on. They won’t even power on when connected to the power source.  Since they’re from a third-party the only thing Amazon was able to do was give me a $20 credit which I appreciate but these were more than $20.

Awesome All Around Until...


Got this almost 2 years ago and it had worked well. Sounds nice, good battery life and a sufficient amount of ear pieces. I don't use it too much and I'm pretty gentle with all my headphones. However, right before hitting the 2 year mark, the wires started peeling off right where they connect to the buds on both sides. I've wrapped a tape around them for now until I find a new one, but it won't be another Senso, that's for sure.

While I was really high on these earbuds initially, now that the third pair has failed less than five months after they replaced them.

the treble isn't as crystal clear as what I get from the beats solo but it makes up for that in the volume and depth of the bass output. i love it because it drowns out the surrounding noise and makes me focus on my workout. i'm giving it a 5 star because the sound difference dissipated within minutes of listening to full track and getting used to it.

They are better than you expect for sub-$50 headphones. Everything works as advertised. So far I have used them for weightlifting and some light cross-training.

I love these!!!! I am big into running, and I've bought numerous ear phones. I've tossed earphones that have been cheap and stopped charging, or they continued to fall out of my ears during runs.The biggest issue is finding earphones that STAY in your ears during runs.

Little sad about these, but they are low in price, so you get what you pay for. They could be great, the sound is actually pretty great, but one hour into use and the Bluetooth connection is choppy for me (my phone pairs well with other devices) and the around ear fitting is far too large for me and you can’t adjust it.

The foam bud covers really do adjust to size of the ear canal and they adhere better than the rubber ones


Just used them twice while working out.  This is the first set of ear buds to stay in place for me while I'm on the tread mill.  The foam bud covers really do adjust to size of the ear canal and they adhere better than the rubber ones.  The sound is great.  Outside noises are blocked fairly well.  The louder the volume is turned up, the better the ambient noise is kept out.  If there is any drawback, I found that once the sweat accumulated on my neck, the rubber covered wires stuck to my neck.  No big problem when I think about the plusses and the price I paid.

Best headset I've owned


I just received these headphones this weekend, but so far I've got to say I'm very impressed. The sound quality is amazing, and being able to control the volume and song selection from the ear buds is great. The package included chargers for both the headset AND my phone, which was also fantastic. Charging the headset was quick too. It took less than an hour to get a full charge. I did read in the instructions to be careful not to over charge the battery as it will cause the battery to lose its effectiveness. Glad I read that since it would not have occurred to me. Bottom line here is that I love this headset, and the fact that it doubles as something I can answer my phone with with one easy touch just makes it better. Truly a great item. Hopefully it'll last for a long time. 5 star rating was a no-brainer.

Just as good as Beats Wireless Headphones


I’m so over the Beats by Dre wireless headphones because the ear piece breaks every time. I sent them back to Apple & they broke a month later in the same spot but on a different ear. This has also happened to my friends. I bought these Senso pair about 3 months ago & there just as good as the Beats but they only cost $29. Why waste money on Beats when you save money.

Great headphones until they burnt...


I've had these headphones for about a year and they worked great - paired with my phone without issues, stayed in during workouts, and had decent sound quality. They aren't necessarily sound proof, but they worked for working out.The reason I'm giving it one star is because I plugged these in after a workout, and woke up to the headphones melted onto the charger. The headphones (as you can see in the images) came apart at the site of the port. My outlet and charger itself are fine and luckily this didn't start a fire, but this is definitely a safety hazard.Overall, I was content with the product, but this is definitely concerning.

Love Them!


I am not an expert on headphones or ear buds, but I absolutely love these.  I have big headphones that I was using prior to these.  The quality of the sound of my ear buds is not as good as the headphones, but pretty close, and I  can use them inside or outside.  I can also talk on the phone, which is so nice for hands free in the car or doing other activities.

Definitely worth it.


Great so far. Mainly used for the gym. Have only had them about a week or two. Haven't had to charge them yet with moderate use. The earpieces that go around the tops of your ears are slightly flimsy, but overall stay in place well. Sound quality is very good, especially for wireless. The bluetooth communication over the phone is okay, some people say I sound good, some say I sound not good. I dont really need them for talking on the phone so I dont really care.Only problem I have with them is a slight buzzing noise in the left earbud. Only happens every so often, and I can only tell if I don't have anything playing on them.For the price point, I definitely like them and would recommend to anyone else.Update: Less than a year later the left earpiece quit working. Now I only have sound in the right one. Disappointed, but they worked well until today.

Great sound, easy connect-ability, good range, great value for your money, comfortable - however, it says 8 hours battery life...I don't think that's true. I don't use it for that long for the battery is drained and it powers off. Anyway, overall I am happy with the quality for the price!

Just what I was looking for!


Just what I was looking for. I wanted wireless headphones that didn't cost $150+, fit comfortably, and sounded good. I thought the Powerbeats were the solution but man those things are expensive. My girlfriend and I ordered a pair of headphones and they are amazing! They fit really well with the original ear pieces. There are two other sizes for different sized ears. I ran on the treadmill and felt it was very secure.The sound is really great! I don't have it at the maximum setting and it's still very loud.If you are thinking of getting headphones that are inexpensive yet high quality, buy Senso!

I absolutely LOVE the headphones.  They are perfect for working out and can stand up to sweat without falling out my ears.  I was laying on my back lifting free weights and would always have to adjust and readjust my headphones.  Well not this time, these are the most comfortable and great sounding headphones I've owned and I've owned the best.  But for the price, value, quality and can stand up to a tough sweaty work out get these headphones...trust me you will not be disappointed.

I bought these earphones because my ears are really small and the normal shape earphones do not fit. At first I bought just to try them out, but I've had them for almost 3 years now and they are really, really good. The sound is clear, they are light and easily adjustable.

These headphones are great. I bought them after being frustrated with a different pair i bought on Groupon that were horrible. These keep a charge for a long time, I workout everyday for an hour and they last two weeks. I do turn them off after each workout . If I don't use them everyday they last about 4 weeks on one charge. The range is great too I can walk pretty far away from my phone and still have connection that is clear. Would recommend these to anyone. Good value for product and price.

Great, while they worked. - but SENSO madethings right.


I bought these 3 months ago. They have already stopped working. I charged them and they won't turn on.Before then, they were great. They canceled noise well, they held a good charge, and they sounded good. They also fit in my ears well.I hope Senso contacts me to repair or replace my headphones. I'll update this review if Senso contacts me.UPDATE: SENSO immediately made this good. They sent a replacement pair. Updated from ** to ****. I docked one * for the failure in the first place, but they are a very good value.

Manufacturer stands behind product


Great customer service! Stopped taking a charge during the one-year warranty period, after heavy use, and manufacturer immediately replaced the headphones upon request. They're comfortable and sound quality is excellent, with a higher volume than another brand I've used. I'd go 5 stars but the signal often cuts out when I keep my iPod in my pocket for a run, to the point where I'm buying an armband for this purpose (the other brand doesn't have the issue, so I can't blame my iPod).

Great depth of sound and ease of use.  After debating over getting Beats for a while, I found these to be just as good at a fraction of the cost.  I would highly recommend these!  The only downfall is that the part that fits over the ear is not adjustable.  It will keep them from falling off your ears, but won't keep them glued to your head if you decide to do high intensity exercise.

NOT good for calls, pretty decent sound AND


*UPDATED* 1 month in...Q: ""How's the CALL quality""?A:  DO NOT rely on these as a main ""talking device""... I don't believe in their 'noise interference cancellation' statement what-so-ever. The calls are NOT thorough, nor are they clear. Yes, the wind gets in the way & YES the static is strong!!! Period.Q: ""Comfortable"" ?A: Nope. The ear ""holes"" that go inside the eardrums are extremely uncomfortable (3 other buyers I know personally, agree). So be careful with long uses.A handful of dropped songs/calls this far but not horrible. I love the fact that they automatically power off if they're left not in use for over 10min or so.[But other than that]...(ORIGINAL REVIEW) don't doubt all the negative and ""dramatic"" reviews like I did. I'm happy I clicked ""add to cart"". I mean c'mon. Can't complain too much. These are $40, not $250.

Don't Buy These


After using these at the gym for about 3 weeks, the music started cutting out while I was listening to them. I made sure they were charged, tried them again and still had some crackling, and then the next week they started to automatically shut off about 45 minutes after using them. Even with a full charge, they did this every day. I asked about returning them and it was conveniently 5 days after the return window closed. So basically, if you have any issues with these more than a few weeks after you get them, you're screwed. Save your money and do not buy these.

New version sucks


I had the old version and it last me for about 5 months for the price sound quality and materials they were great after that one earbud stopped working so I bought another one but it was different from the previous one POS the charging button is not so har to open , the sound button is very responsive . Cons the thing that goes around your ear now is like a type of wire and is hard to ajuste, and the on off button doesn’t click no more like if it is stuck (but I still can use it , but one day all of the sudden they don’t turn on)

Hard to beat for the price


The sound is rich and the controls are very simple to use.  The earpieces come in 3 different sizes and they are soft foam that conforms to the ear instead of hard silicone.  The case is a nice hardshell to protect the earbuds while in a gym bag.  Thr company emailed me shortly after delivery to make sure I was satisfied and reminded me that these have a 1 year warranty.  I'd rather spend my miney in thesr than any of the Plantronics earbuds that I've used in the past and stopped charging after a few months.

Still survived for a good two years before one year stopped working. I mean, what more can one expect! Absolutely amazing earphones and even better service!

The sound quality and battery life was great! I grabbed these for work because i have to move around alot and its too easy for a headphone cord to get snagged. However this became a problem with these as well, it says 30 feet, but really it means 30 feet if angled the right direction. Besides leaving my phone(fully charged) on the table top while walking around the table I also tried leaving it in a hip pocket with the top poking out and I still got a choppy signal. Icant carry my phone in my hand while working, back to cords for me I guess.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS


These are terrible headphones. The bass is outrageously overpowering. They had claimed on prime day to sell for over 100 dollars, however this was a classic case of trying to make the consumer think we were getting a great deal when really the ear buds cost 2 bucks to make. The ear clips do nothing, they float above your ear and have no structure in them to mold them around your ears. Listening to these bad boys pretty much kid like listening to your music underwater. If you value in any way shape or form what your music sounds like, AVOID AT ALL COSTS

They promised to replace my ""defective"" headphones, but did not fulfill their promise....last SENSO purchase for me.


Used these a few times and then they would not connect at the gym (where I need to use them and why I bought them.)  I contacted SENSO and they recommended resetting to factory settings.  I tried it with no luck.  They then said that they would follow up on these ""defective"" headphones and arrange a replacement pair.  There has been no follow up and no responses to my emails since that promise.  They talked a good customer service story, but apparently do not honor their customer service promises.

Awesome product and EVEN BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE


I bought these for use on my bicycle.  The first time I used them I was impressed; they were easy to use, sounded great and were comfortable; but I detected a loss of signal causing an interruption in the right ear piece.  I tried them on a second ride and noted the same problem.  When I bought them I received an e-mail from the manufacturer complimenting me on my purchase and outlining the return and warranty procedures urging me to contact them if there was a problem.  I did.  They recommended that I take some steps to ""reset"" their headphones and with a GREAT deal of skepticism I did.  I was rewarded with exactly what I wanted when I bought my headphones - trouble free, great sound in a very comfortable and easy to use product.  I can and do heartily recommend both the product and the after-purchase customer service.  Buy these headphones with confidence and enjoy!

I was little skeptical while ordering the Senso earphones. The reason I ordered is due to the great avg feedback by over 5000 users.

Friends were talking about this because of the great price .  I needed a head set so I looked this up and got one. Very easy to set up charged the set then after that started using it .  The Sound is GREAT and was happy to now be able to hear the true clear sound from HD movies, music and wow talk about the baise.  It also came with a car charger which I didn't know I was getting and two charge cables one smaller which I pluged into a charger at home and then a Longer one which I used in my car. Found the right ear buds to fit my ear and when I was all done using it I put it all in the nice case that came with it.  I am very pleased.  I am using this with my HTC phone and Samsung tablet.

The sound is fine, the charging is fine. The only drawback I have seen is that the earpieces seem to fold over when it is in my pocket. I then have to straighten them out to use them. I like they are soft, but perhaps they are ""too soft"". This is my second pair of senson headphones so I do like them. The first set, also soft did not break but I needed a second pair so I could have them where I was working out and at home.

I liked the earbuds at first. I don’t normally like earbuds but I found these very comfortable when the right earpiece was used. My problem came after about a month and a half to 2 months. It started to behave like it had a loose wire. It would cut in an out I one ear bud until finally it just stopped connecting. I haven’t been able to use them since. They won’t connect to my phone or do a factory reset. It will power off and power on but not connect or do anything else.

I found that if the sound seems a little muffled, changing the equalizer on my phone to something like “acoustic” brings out more of the mid and upper ranges to compensate. The battery life is outstanding- the longest stretch I’ve gone so far was 6 hrs, and they still had battery life left. The only thing I’d change if I could is to make the cord that connects them to each other (that goes behind your neck) thinner/more flexible. It tends to pop out of the adjuster-snap-thingy. Overall, I’m quite happy with them, and am considering getting a second pair to use at the office.

Don't waste your money like I did!


I am writing a review to express my frustration over the quality (or lack thereof), since it's way past my return window. These earphones have been spotty with volume in the left ear... and now, there is ZERO volume, ZERO sound in my left ear. I am tired of hoping something will change. These are destined for the trash, and now I must spend more $ money on a competitor's brand. I will not consider this brand again.

After researching bluetooth headphones I decided on this product.  I was a little unsure about buying them for my daughter's birthday because the price isn't as high as other good headphones.  But this product is great!  The stereo sound is clear and they are super easy to set up and enjoy.  I've  since bought another pair for me.  Yeah!

A Great Choice!!!


I had been looking for a pair of wireless headphones but didn't want to break the bank, these are perfect!! The sounds quality is great and they are very comfortable.  I originally got these to use during my workouts and have not had a problem with them falling out or being in the way.  But I have also found myself wearing them around the house while cleaning.  I love that I can leave my phone in one room and just go about cleaning without having to worry about having my phone with me at all times.  The range they stay connected is pretty impressive!!  I would definitely recommend these (and already have) to anyone in the market for a pair of wireless earbuds with good quality at a great price!

Great headphones, excellent value.


Had these for a week, will change my review if I becomes necessary in the future. Until then, these work great! I live in a townhouse, so after syncing them with my phone, I listened to music while upstairs (phone downstairs) and it was fantastic. The real test will come at the gym, until then I give 5 stars. Also, I didn't know, but you can't sync them while charging.

Very good Headphones at a very good price.


The SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are wonderful and at a very good price. They are very comfortable, easy to put on and have a very nice sound.  I use mine around the house as my wife doesn't enjoy (euphemism) sports talk and I do. After using them to a point where the batteries are used up (I fall asleep to movie on my iPad), a complete charge only takes about one and a half hours. Very pleased with SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.

Great sound at a great price!


I've never used wireless headphones before. I had some old noise cancellation wired headphones that went bad on me. I replaced them with the Senso Bluetooth Headphones & I am not disappointed. They have a great sound and are easy to use. My only complaint is that I prefer foam earbuds that are moldable to your ears, where I feel I can get a deeper bass response and a better protection against noise.

I cannot believe how comfortable they are and the AMAZING sound


Given the very low price, I was nervous about buying these.  I cannot believe how comfortable they are and the AMAZING sound.  They do last about 8 hours, connect very easily via bluetooth and I could not be happier.This past week I forgot to charge them up and had to use my old earbuds - which I thought had great sound.  After using my Senso headphones, I will never, never, never go back to my those hard-wired earbuds - they sounded ""tinny,"" aren't nearly as comfortable, and I constantly get the chord caught on things.Senso, THANK YOU!!!  I am currently deployed in Afghanistan and your headphones make things much more bearable!!

Best gym earphones you can find without spending 100$


Just had my first workout with these on and they are awesome. Here is my feedback. If you are looking for inexpensive Bluetooth earphones for your gym workout, go for these. They are cheap and they sound really good for the price. I use them for my 1 hour long runs. Usually my ears pain if I use earphoned for that long. Nothing like that happened here, sound quality was good and they fit really well. As soon as I got them I got an email from the company where they just wanted to check about their product, so 5 stars for customer support as well.Cant really say much about durability and battery yet. But sound,fit,price and customer support all aspects call for a 5 star review.

Middle aged can actually sync these!


I love these and bought a second set, which were taken by my best friend!  They’re very easy to sync (and I’m middle age).  I use an iPhone and it was just a button or two and viola!  The sound is great.  I’m not tethered by a cord constantly.  There are multiple size ear pieces, which is good because I’m a femal with smaller ears.  Definitely worth every penny.

Great headphones!


These actually stay in my ears!  The sound is very good, with both speaking and music.  It is easy to connect with my Iphone.  The button to turn it on and off is just the right size to touch when they are still in my ears.  I like that it tells me when they are connected and when they disconnect.  The part around the ear is very flexible and does not bother my ear, even when I am wearing my glasses.

The earbuds are light weight, provide clear sound and just enough noise dampening to help me ignore outside distractions without totally cutting me off from what's going on around me. I used them in the gym for a good two hours and they never slipped out my ears. Better still, they were comfortable to wear from the beginning to end of my workout. I'm looking forward to using them on my next plane flight to listen to music and watch videos!

I like them


The first thing I did after removing the headphones from the sturdy box is to lose the instructions manual. BTW, Amazon, putting a small box carrying electronics inside of a larger box with a wad of brown paper to protect it seems dumb. Paper compresses and stays compressed, leaving the contents able to bounce around inside of the external box.That said, the headphones are nicely nestled inside of the sturdy, padded, zippered clamshell carrying case, and Senso's packaging is a small, hard box. I found the instructions manual online.The sound is quite good. These are not ridiculously-overpriced-rhymes-with-Dose-you-would-sell-your-toddler-to-the-circus-if-he-flushed-them-down-the-toilet headphones. No tingles-down-to-your-toes bass nor the sound-of-a-pin-dropping high notes. However, the sound is crisp and clear. The headphones are very comfortable. They come with a variety of squishy earbud thingies for a custom fit. The noise cancellation is good. You can hear an emergency siren, but not the drunk with Tourette's yammering away to a captive audience on the bus. Bliss.I personally would not wear these while riding my bicycle because I think it's dangerous and makes me kind of clueless to people/cars/bikes around me. Use your common sense and do what's best for you.

These headphones came when promised. I did not use them this weekend - sadly just after the return window closed. The audio quality is absolutely terrible, terrible, terrible. I was not expecting Bose but, music sounds shallow, hollow and has an echo.  No bass whatsoever. I would gladly return these if I could.  They were not soooo inexpensive that this quality is justified.

Great and much cheaper than I was expecting.


Been very happy with this. The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is the buttons don't match my iPhone functions. For example, with Apple headphones, if you press the button once, it advances to the next song. With this, if you press the button twice, it redials the last number. Not what I was trying to do. With you could change or sync up the buttons. Not a big deal after you realize the diff functions though.

Best pair I've owned at this price


These are great earbuds.  Good quality sound.  Deep base is a little raspy, but good overall quality, especially for the price point.  Very little issue so far with connectivity or wind noise, but I wear my phone in an arm band when working out.  My only concern is the cover for the charging point seems loose and flimsy, I am concerned that at some point t will fall open and sweat will invade the space which is fatal flaw in all wireless earbuds I've ever owned.

Great buds and great customer service


Ive had these headphones for a few weeks now and they are great!  Seamless bluetooth connection and great sound quality.  Im very active and they can handle everything i have already put them through.  You wont find a bigger bang for your buck.  Trust me!  I own 4 other pairs of varying styles and brands.Also, they have one of the best customer service departments ive encountered.  I ripped the cord from one side biking yesterday.  I sent them an email asking if i could warranty them.  It was an almost immediate yes.  Within a few hours of that email, they have already processed and shipped a replacement.  When they say 'hassle free', they truly mean it.  You can tell they genuinely care what you think and they genuinely want you to enjoy their products.  I have a feeling that if you dont like what you have received, they will gladly make things right.

They fit/ will stay in your ear!


This product has really added to the enjoyment of my runs. Bluetooth was easy to pair with my phone, allowing me to listen to music and hear updates from the running app I use while running. Battery life is long and they charge surprisingly quickly.The best part about these headphones is that they fit perfectly in my ears and STAY in my ears while running. There are several bud sizes provided, and I was able to select the ones that work (turns out I need one size in one ear and another for the other) the carrying case and wrap card are excellent additions I, Unfortunately, haven't had a chance to use yet.My only complaint is the ""door"" that covers the charging port is flimsy, and I just know I'm eventually going to break it off.

They work great majority of the time. Occasionally the connection is weak and requires turning off and on again. Not a fan of the over the ear piece but I bought it for the price. The sound is nice.

I love the packaging - the case is great


Just got these yesterday. I love the packaging - the case is great, the cable is ingenious with the lightning cable and adapter for charging the headphones as well. Pairing with my iPhone 7 was so simple and the controls are easy to get used to. The sound is great. I tested the microphone to make a call and the call went fine. The only problem is that the lowest setting is a tad too robust when listening to music in a quiet environment. However, it seems this is an issue with other bluetooth headphones as well. Don't know if an adjustment needs to be made with the phone of with the headphones themselves.

Love them!!


I've had these for about two weeks now and so far so good! I typically wear them for about 45 minutes in the morning and again the same amount of time in the afternoon - both during my commute to and from work. They are very comfortable in my ear and the sound is really fantastic! I actually have to keep the volume on the lowest setting because otherwise it's too loud. I also like that the cord that goes around the back of your neck is a cord, not a hard piece of plastic that I have seen on other wireless headsets - making it very comfortable to wear. They are easy to use with the buttons on the ear piece to change songs or adjust the volume, if needed. I haven't used them yet for a phone call so I don't have any feedback on that yet. Overall I am very happy with this purchase at such a great price!! No need to buy those expensive ones where you are just paying for the brand name - the quality of these wireless headphones is really great!

Pretty good headphones, only lasted 15 weeks.


Sound quality is pretty good for working out, they sometimes lost connection on the bike outside, but running is fine most of the time. They lasted exactly 15 weeks of training before pooping out.

Failure To Launch


I am a runner. I have been looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones to replace my wired Skullcandy Methods for what feels like forever.  The Methods are great but I don't care for the in-line controller bobbing up and down when I run. I have not and cannot find a pair that hits on the two key factors I'm looking for: comfort and connectivity. After checking the reviews for big dollar earphones like Beats, JayBirds, etc., I decided to give these ""no-name"" headphones a go. The reviews were excellent - much better than the really expensive brands. So I figured, what the heck - have at it.To me, there is no in between review on a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Either they work well all the time or they don't. I don't want to be on a 10 mile run and at mile 4 the connection cuts out or the battery unexpectedly dies. That's the worst case scenario for me.  So, to that point, the Senso ActivBuds S-250s get one star. They didn't work - right out of the box.  Sure, there's a lot of bonus goodness in the package but if the headphones don't deliver, what good are the extra comfort tips? If the signal cuts out, who cares about the extra charging cable?Testing the headphones in my office, they seemed poised to deliver. Bass was a bit heavy but I simply used the Bass Reducer option on my ipod to get the sound the way I like it. Inside, at my desk, the headphones worked as expected. But hey, these are SPORT headphones. I need to get them outside and test them on a run. So, today I did just that. And before I could even take one step down the sidewalk, the sound started cutting in and out.  As I moved, so did the audio - like a skipping record. The connection seems to work inside but outside it's a no go. There was no way I was going to start out on my run and ""hope"" it worked as expected. If it can't maintain a solid connection outside, while I was walking around my driveway (with my iPod on my arm, mind you, inches away from the headphones), how is it going to handle a run?So, since the headphones can't pass the connection test, they're going back. And I'm still searching for a pair of Bluetooth headphones/earbuds that can stay comfortable, connected and will stand up to a half-marathon distance on a consistent basis.  If you're a runner and if you're looking for the same thing, these are not the headphones you're looking for.

These headphones are amazing. If you are looking for something with clear and loud sound quality, you just found them. They are some of the best headphones that I have ever owned.

Faced a some glitches getting it to pair w/ my iphone but got it working and loved it for walking or jogging


Apparently works for a lot of people but lasted a mere two weeks for me. Faced a some glitches getting it to pair w/ my iphone but got it working and loved it for walking or jogging. No wires! But eventually pairing failed once and was a hassle to get going again. And, then, finally, it wouldn't pair at all; replacing app, returning to factory settings, charging, rebooting, etc. Nothing worked. There is a note in the instructions that the device is sensitive to moisture. I'm going to assume this is what happened. It was damaged by exposure to sweat. I used to have a similar problem with the iPod mini. Anyway, beware. Not a good consumer product.

Great for listening only


These headphones fit snugly in the ears which keeps a lot of the surrounding noise out . They also stay in the ears really well when moving around and they have a long range and excellent battery life. The microphone on these things is terrible though. Even in a quiet room people can barely hear what I am saying. This is because the microphone is all the way up by the ear, which makes it difficult to pick up sound from talking. For the price there are better options with better mics. Get these only if you plan on listening to music, and never plan on talking on the phone with them.

I use these primarily for workouts.  They are comfortable, stay in place even when I am sprinting and the sound is much better than I expected.

I would recommend these for exercise and I'm very happy with the purchase.

Great set of earbuds!


We love these headphones!  My husband and I both bought a pair and enjoy the freedom that Bluetooth gives you! Love that the earbuds come with 3 different size ear pieces and 2 charging cords!  The longer cord fits both android and iphone. The little case fits the small charger and my earbuds and is small enough to fit in my purse. I have to say they don't take long to charge and seem to last forever.  Great product for the price!

I'm very impressed


What can I say? I'm very impressed and have absolutely nothing negative to say about these Bluetooth headphones. They connected easily on the first try, the volume is very strong and they feel extremely comfortable. I like the warranty and the fact that they are waterproof which means that I can wear these while mowing the lawn and working out and the sweat wont ruin them

Great birthday gift


Received these headphones on my birthday. Not really a headphones type person but the standard ones that came with my phone sucked or ones I have bought have store eventually fail. I mainly use them when working outdoor around the house doing chores mowing etc. I was constantly pulling one earbud out of my ear by moving around while mowing and on riding mower. Now I dont have to pull one out of my ear to talk to someone can just pause them and they are of course wireless so I dont have to pull phone out of pocket constantly. Great noise cancellation. Not looking to use the waterproof feature anytime soon lol. Comes with so many accesories. I was floored. Great gift or awesome purchase.

The mic is a HUGE problem.


There are 2 reasons why I can't make it a 5 rating. I would have rated it a 3.5 but that isn't an option1. The michophone is horribly place and as a result, people have a different time hearing me and I have to resort to removing it from my ear and holding it up to my mouth which defeats the purpose of hands free or I just let it hang.2. I wish the battery life was longer. That said, the battery life is about 8 hours as advertised.

So far so good


I like how these buds stay in your ear even during rigorous activities. The only thing I would change is the ear hook be more rigid instead of soft and rubbery, but still does an adequate job of keeping the buds on your ears.  Sound is very good compared to other cheaper brands where it sounds like you're listening to something inside a cupboard.  So far very satisfied with this purchase.

I have tried many headphones of every conceivable type searching for the one that would meet my expectations and Senso has accomplished this task completely. They are comfortable for long term wear and the sound quality is great. They fit snugly and comfortly if you are just sitting or jogging and the noise canceling is the best I have experience.

Wonderful headphones. Great for running


Wonderful headphones. Great for running. They are comfortable and stayed in my ears no problem. I ran a couple 8k's with zero problems. I did however notice a slight problem when it's windy outside and running. The wind whips through the headphones and kind of interferes with the music. You can still hear your music but it doesn't block out the wind. All in all a great product for a good price.

Solid Product and Solid Customer Service


While I did have some issues with the headphones and wasn't sure why, the customer service I received to get them resolved was 10 out of 10. Available 24/7 and answer right away. Very courteous and easy to understand. Initially they had me do a factory re-set over the phone and I was back going 5 minutes later. Unfortunately, for whatever reason my headphone just would not charge or turn on after that. While anyone would be frustrated, I called them back and they were able to get new ones sent out for me right away. I had 2 great months with the headphones before they crapped on me, but the year warranty came in handy and the customer service is what kept me coming back.

Great headphones, best $40.00 investment I ever made


Quick Update:  After having use the earphones for over a month I have to say this has been the best $40.00 investment I have ever made. Continue to sound great. I exercise in the water 4 days a week and no problem getting them wet. They stay in my ears and the Bluetooth distance is excellent and far better than the 33 feet in the specs.  Would recommend them over the others I have used in the past.  Great Job Senso!Love these earbuds.  Fantastic sound.  The specs say the bluetooth is good for 33 feet but I find they work from a lot longer distance.  I can have my phone on one end of a 25 meter pool and still get receptions on the other side.  Works great in the water.  It's nice doing my water exercises to music.

Not recommended for high intensity activity


If you're buying these for running or weightlifting where your head is relatively stable, then they're ok if you don't mind the low bass on your music clipping. Speakers aren't anything to write home about.However I bought these to use during boxing and crossfit, and they refuse to stay in my ears. On top of all that the pause button is super sensitive and on the side, so if you push the earbud back in nine times out of ten it will pause the music. I returned mine because there are definitely better alternatives.

Not What I Had Hoped For.


I bought two of these - one for my wife and one for me. Neither one is working after only four months. My wife's stopped working about two months ago, just a dead, cold stop. With mine, first one earpiece stopped working and then the other one stopped. The unit turns on after about three tries, but turns off within seconds. I hope to take advantage of the one year manufacturer warranty if i can find the information.As it is, I have to keep trying to find some ear buds that will work longer than these or buy a new car with Bluetooth (I would buy the car, but I am waiting on the Tesla Model 3's to be built!). Of course, just like most of us, I don't want to pay through the nose for a good pair.

they are reasonably comfortable, the bass is a little weak


I have been using these for many weeks on a regular basis. They stay on, they are reasonably comfortable, the bass is a little weak, but improves if you shove them into the ear a bit farther. For the money, you can't go wrong. The battery doesn't last as long inbetween uses as I would like, but hey, plug them in more often! Great bang for the buck.

Balogney- doe not cancel ambient noise


Absolutely no noise canceling in this headset. They apparently think that Qualcomm's cvc6.0 makes them noise canceling. Some marketing idiot is just lying about this feature, as they are at Qualcomm, because you can hear all outside noise on both the earpieces and the microphone at full level. Good sound quality in earphones, but quality and noise canceling are two different things.

Good for baths


If you're like me and love baths, you've undoubtedly burned through multiples of headphones that got just a itty bitty bit wet from being dunked in the bathtub by accident. The headphones are usually fine in water, but if the headphone port gets wet while the jack is in it it's usually over. With their water resistance and blue tooth feature, these headphones solve both issues and sound nice to boot.

I've only used these headphones for a couple days but am really happy with them.  They were really easy to set up via bluetooth with my iPhone 7+.  The battery life has been great.  Used them on and off yesterday at work and didn't get a low battery chirp.  I actually had them on standby quite a bit because I got busy and forgot to turn them off.

Also came with some cool extras (iPhone charger), different size ear buds and nice case. Highly recommend for those users that workout quite a bit.

The first pair I bought seemed to be broken. The left earpiece (the one with all the buttons and ports) was very distorted.

Better for indoor use.  Any wind ruins sound


If you encounter any wind at all, these headphones are not great.  Wind sounds are amplified by the shape of the ear buds, making it extremely difficult to enjoy your music.  I really can't run outdoors with these headphones unless there is absolutely no wind.  Definitely wouldn't recommend using them while on a bicycle for the same reason.I think senso makes other models with a smaller form factor, which may be better for outdoor use.

Great value!


I got these wireless headphones primarily for use at the gym, where I use them paired either with my iphone or, when I'm on the gym's cardio equipment, with a bluetooth transmitter (TaoTronics Transmitter TT-BA01U)  plugged in to the equipment's 3.5mm jack for tv viewing.  So far they work flawlessly...easy pairing, easy switching from one paired device to another, and very good sound, with easy to use control of volume, pause and skip functions.  I haven't used it for phone calls yet, so I can't comment on that aspect.  Earbuds are a reasonable fit and the headset feels secure, even when running.  In sum, they are everything I was hoping for and at a very reasonable price-point.

If you need more volume than standard ear buds buy this


I really find the max volume of an iPhone with wired earbuds to be much to quiet. The SENSO blue tooth earbuds are much louder and I can finally here callers. Quality wise the are fine. Mine died after a little less than a year. However they were good about getting me a replacement. In any case I find that all earbuds only last 6 months so the SENSO ones were about average. If you are a hard user of ear buds I strongly recommend getting the insurance. SENSO took care of my problem under warranty but I had about to days left when it died

Still my favorite !!!


May 19, 2017 UPDATE:The more I use these the more I like them.  The Bluetooth is very fast for linking - connects to my iPad and iPhone at the same time... If I'm watching a movie on the iPad and a call comes in - the movie automatically pauses and I can answer the phone with the same dual connected headset.Just today I noticed that I left the phone in the garage when I walked away - I got to 100 Feet before it started to lose connection.  I've never had a set hold a signal so strong with distances like that!Just FYI - I still like the sound and performance.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ How do you compare headphones?  I tend to think a wide ranging recording from the analog days will reveal any flaws with range of tonality for reproduction.  Hence I suggest you play a good reproduction of the song by the Rightous Brothers ""Unchained Melody"".  Please don't cast it away as music not to your taste - it's for a control sample so key in on the highs and lows of the vocals and music and then try playing it on your other headphones.I'm not easily impressed having used my Plantronics Go2 for over a year with high satisfaction.  Now I keep my Plantronics in the junk drawer with the rest of the old stuff that use to rule my digital life.It makes no sense to go on about my perceptions except to encourage you to buy these, try them as I described and see for yourself. They offer a 100% refund so I figured why not and would not have hesitated to send them back like I have others that over promise and don't deliver.Here is a couple of points:1.  Use the foam plugs for a tighter sound inside your ear canal2.  There is not a very active noise cancel feature I can tell - but the sound is so rich it actually 'takes over' exterior sounds... I noticed this while walking along a busy road - I hardly heard any cars go by me - I was impressed in the rich sound.3.  My hearing is physically reduced in the high tone range... so a wider range of low to high lets me enjoy an immersive sound experience. So I can't be sure my hearing is a factor except I compared these to three other ""good"" buds, and hands-down I enjoy these the best BY FAR.4. Strong blue-tooth signal and fast easy pairing - awesome !I Paid $36.96 which sounded cheep and worried me maybe these would be just a run of the mill sub $100 buds - but that's all I could afford so I took a chance fully intending to send them back if they didn't at least do half as good of my Plantronics... Now I'm looking to buy another for back-up because they are my current favorite.Please test them as I suggest and post your findings to share with me if I am right ... or is it just me and my ears????

Great price but these just don't last. this worked great for 5 months but now, they're useless. It shows that it's fully charged but when you try to connect NOTHING happens.

This is a great set of headphones.  I walk, run workout, etc and have no problems with them staying in my ears.

I can skip music with the ear buttons.  It also holds a charge for a long time, although I'm not sure how because it has never run out of charge. After several uses i just charge it.

... had these in the past and I do not like these at all


I've had these in the past and I do not like these at all. I think they got a 3 cause they could be worse but the ear pieces are not as soft as the previous one of the same brand. They don't have as good of sound, when i put my phone in my pocket the sound skips as if the bluetooth connection isn't strong enough depsite it saying it has a 30ft distance. Definitely wish my old ones still worked!

Peanut Head + Tiny Ears = NO FIT


The sounds quality is great.  The only thing that I am not fond of is the fact that they do NOT fit my ears.  If I were the manufacturer, I would at least make a pair that targets female ears, or add an adjustable ear holder.  Otherwise, it is easy to charge, setup, and connect to my iPhone.  I would buy again as a present to someone with big ears for sure.

I do like them. However


I wanted to give them a 4, but the issues I have had kept me from doing so.  I do like them.  However, I am a little disappointed with the range.  I was expecting more.  Maybe it's normal compared to others.  The other issue I have been having is the connection keeps dropping.  I don't know if it's the buds or my phone.  I did not have this problem with other Bluetooth ear buds in the past. Just something to keep in mind. I would still say they are a good deal for the price I paid ($35 I think).

I’m on my third pair. These are fantastic for anyone who misplaced headphones like I do! The price just keeps getting better, and so do the headphones. My newest paid has flexible ear hooks and the charging port is much easier to open than previous older versions.Anyway, for the price, these are the best headphones by far. By a mile.

Wasn't Sure if I'd like these, but they are amazing for the price.


Bought these expecting budget quality (washed out and flat), and I have been pleasantly surprised.  They have a full range of sound and carry bass beautifully.  I work a fast paced physical job that's often sweaty, and they haven't fallen, slipped, or had any degradation of quality.  It does help to get a clip to attach them to your collar to prevent the cord from sliding around.

Excellent Headphones


Wonderful headphones, still work spectacularly after testing them in the shower, fit the ears nicely with exceptional sound quality. Worth the $40 I spent, easily. I've found, however, at least with my Amazon Fire Phone, if I receive a phone call of some kind while listening to music, after having accepted and ended the call, I must go back to my music and press to pause it and pay it again so that my headphones resume control over the music. Excellent call quality, easy to use and learn the controls.

Mediocre


Decent for a cheap set of Bluetooth earbuds. Easy to pair and use. Audio quality is pretty muddy and bad, especially at the mid-range (to be expected for the price). There seem to be a lot of similar-looking, cheap Bluetooth earbuds around this price range, which might be separated by what accessories they come with. This pair has a cable for charging the headphones or an iPhone, a carrying case, and a car adapter.There is nothing special that would make me buy this (or any other cheap Bluetooth headset) again. If you just need sound in your ears when you work out and aren't picky about audio quality, you could go for these.

If Audio Quality Isn't Your Priority, Then Okay.


I was first attracted to the price of these bluetooth earbuds; however, upon the first listen, I knew I was 100% dissatisfied. The audio is poor and has little to no bass--mostly treble tracks are heard. On top of it all, there was audio feedback/white noise during moments of no audio playing (i.e. between tracks, while on pause, etc.). Purchase returned same day.

I have well over 10 good, real life friends with an additional couple hundred ...


So here's my review on these red SENSO Bluetooth Headphones/Earbuds that I’ve owned for about a month now that were purchased for four primary reasons.The main reason above all others is so that I don't continue to be interrupted by the front desk girl at the gym, who constantly follows me around the gym and talks to me as I work out.Now don't get me wrong, I'm a very social kinda guy. In fact, I have well over 10 good, real life friends with an additional couple hundred who are either real and/or imaginary/online friends on places like FB, TWTR, and so forth..When I'm in the gym however, it's my time...my time to meditate and think about the day ahead, look through my stock portfolio, check out motorbikes for sale online, or do whatever...with her practically following me around the gym as she cleans, mops, and blabbles on about her life...it's just too much for me to handle. I felt enough’s enough, and it was time to shut it down - hence the need for these earbuds.The second reason is that my gym plays the same Internet stream of EDM/electronica music every single day. Now the first few days when I joined the gym years back, it was ok, but after the first week, I just can’t take it anymore - and I have no clue why I didn’t use earbuds much sooner.The third reason is because one of the personal trainers in my gym counts the repetitions of his clients performing the latest, greatest, butt-blasting, ab routines, so darn loud that it throws off my own mental count when hitting the weights. I’ve tried to be in sync with his counts on occasion, but I just can’t do it, man...And finally, the fourth reason I purchased these is because I didn't want to ruin any of my existing good pairs of earbuds. I've spent a ridiculous amount of cash on other buds and full headsets, and didn't want to ruin any of them with sweat, or damage that the gym may bring on.So overall, I believe that each of the four criteria above have been accomplished with these Bluetooth earbuds.As an aside, I've lost track of how long the battery lasts, but I can easily say that they go strong for at least 5 hours of solid use, but more toward 6-8 hours if I really think about it. And they do charge pretty quickly - I want to say that within 2 hours or less they're fully charged.The cons to these buds are as follows:1) I often have one heck of a time initially connecting these to my iPhone 6. And this is probably my biggest annoyance with these and the reason they get four stars. Yep, everything is up-to-date on the phone and I don’t have any issues with it overall...I've triply checked. I have tried every imaginable scenario - turn Bluetooth on the phone first and wait a few - turn earbuds on first and wait a few - switch from airplane mode on and then off - forget the SENSO device/re-find and attempt to connect - restart my phone. The most successful method that works just about every time is restarting the phone but that drives me up a wall to have to do that. If any of you have a cheap, dirty way of connecting, I’m all ears...literally!!Now once they are connected, I don't recall ever losing a connection, aside from walking away from my phone by a good 30+ feet or so...on a positive note, when I attempt to connect these at the gym, it sometimes takes a good 5+ minutes to establish a connection - which is good, because I completely lose track on the treadmill and it makes the cardio portion of my time really fly by - so in an odd 'turning lemons into lemonade' kinda way, kudos to that. :)2) For under $40 and change, I wasn't expecting the quality of my Bose, Beats, 1More, Klipsch, Bowers & Wilkins, Shures, and the countless others I have....I canoodle on guitar a bit, so I like to listen back to my recordings using a variety of headphones/buds to note as wide a range as possible for dynamic purposes. My ears are pretty good and adept at distinguishing quality characteristics of low, mid, and high frequencies.With that being said, it is essential that your earbuds fit properly if you want to experience all ranges. I’ve read time and time again that people don’t hear the bass. You have to select the proper fitting nubs for your 'ear holes' when it comes down to it or you'll completely miss out on a majority of the ranges if there isn't a proper seating and seal of the buds in your ear canal...and a side note, being that I am wearing these primarily in the gym, or out back by the pool in the hot Vegas sun, I didn't want my sweat or god forbid, ear wax, damaging my other sets of buds - hence why I also purchased these as I may have mentioned.So back to the ranges with a good fitting. The bass is there, but depending upon the gain/distortion/bass in the music you listen to...it will clip at certain decibels. It’s almost as if I hear the digital distortion of on/off, almost solid state sounding distortion as compared to a warm continuous tube amp flow of bass - if that makes sense. Now it isn’t there all the time by any means. Just certain songs on rare occasion. I’m sure it would be there more frequently if I drop some death metal in, but I’m getting to old for that kinda stuff...long live Sepultura, Manowar, and the likes.Moving on, the mids are adequate but can be brightened up a bit, and the highs are acceptable overall that don't overwhelm the ears with any screeching, tinny tones. Now granted, I can tweak the settings a bit to my liking with equalization, but I'm a lazy SOB so I listen to these stock, as is.So overall, I am happy with these earbuds aside from having one heck of time connecting them to my iPhone 6. So a four star out of five from this reviewer.

Fantastic High-End Sound and Quality at a Bargain Price!


Have only had these headphones a couple of days now, but so far, so good. They're very comfortable and they stay put -- I wore them today during my muay Thai warm up, which includes three rounds of rope jumping, and they stayed put AND sounded great. The sound is very clear, and the noise canceling works well. I've had many pairs of headphones -- both wired and Bluetooth -- and these are by far the best yet! They're very intuitive to use for both music listening and making and receiving phone calls. And they come with a hard carrying case, plus lots of peripherals -- everything you need to keep your headphones charged and sounding great! A great-sounding alternative to the more expensive Powerbeats 2 or 3 because you're not paying for the name! I would definitely recommend these headphones to friends and would buy them to give as a gift.

These are some very awesome earbuds. I've worn them to the gym and when running multiple times and have never had any problems whatsoever. They have a perfect fit and are completely secure with the loops which you don't even notice after wearing for a few minutes. Bluetooth works flawlessly and the battery life is great. You also get a bunch of accessories like a car charger, carrying case, two charging cables (one for apple products I think) with different earbud fits. These would make a great gift for anyone you know that is an active runner or gym goer.

Holy Cowbells BatMan. When I first turned them on I barely had any bass. Contacted customer support and they suggested plugging the headset into the charger and pressing the power button for 7 seconds. Also deleting the unit from my BT list in the phone. Then unplugging the unit, pairing with my phone and boom. The headset works perfectly. I get massive bass.

I have used these earphones in the past and they are great.  starting with the design and the sound. the design because all the controls are in the earpiece and that makes it more comfortable and not like the other brands that have a volume bar that is swinging all the time.  However, this time the earphones did not work well.  it was very hard for me to get them connected to the phone and the battery life was very short.  I was in the middle of my workout and the ear set just got disconnected without any reason.

Sound is exactly what i needed. I won't pretend to know anything about sound quality but just needed something to be ""out of the way"" and reliable while running or using the gym. This sure fits the bill. Aside from the easy connection to my device and remarkably long battery life I must admit I was pretty impressed with the packaging. A sturdy, slide out box which includes multiple charging options. A separate case for storage and different size earbuds which, in my case, was a huge factor.In all it seems to be the best value going.  Enjoy!

Very sad to say the quality used to be so much bertter.


I am only giving this three stars due to a decrease in product quality with no decrease in price.  I originally purchased this in Feb of 2017 and it was my first Bluetooth headset.  I loved it.  I did not review it then but I would have given it five stars if I had.  The sound is not as good as wired headphones and the battery life could be longer but it was just what I was looking for in terms of price and quality.  I lost them over the summer so I purchased them again in October 2017.  However, the latest version is a much cheaper quality product.  Instead of rubbery ear flaps and the connector strap, they are more plastic feeling and much less flexible.The end result for the new version is that is that it is difficult to get the flaps my ears and after a while it makes them hurt and gives me a headache because the flap is so rigid and it does not fit perfectly.  Also, the connector cord is much harder and noticeable on the back of my neck as it is difficult to get it in a good resting place because it is so rigid.  The other difference is the USB flap.  On the new one, it seems to be hanging on by only a string.  This bothered me at first as I thought it was going to break off but after more careful observation, it actually looks pretty firm and it is easier to keep open than the original one which was more rubbery and difficult to keep opened long enough to put the cord in.This decrease in quality probably happens a lot with new and successful selling items either in an attempt to reduce cost or as a practical matter in terms of mass producing the units but we don't always know about it.  The only reason that I know is that I eventually found the pair that I had lost.  If I lose them again, I will definitely not be purchasing them again.  I also purchased a set of Bluetooth buds without the wire connector (MindKoo X1T Mini).  I actually like these the best due to there being no wire connecting them but the sound is not as good and the battery lasts only half as long.  However, I have two sets of backups if I need them for more than 3 or 4 hours.

Great for the price but the sound quality is just not the same as a more expensive pair.Also forgot about the battery low issue.  On my Iphone it shows you the battery percentage of the wireless device connected.  So anywhere from 30-50% battery life it starts saying ""battery low"" in the headphones.

$30 really does buy good headphones


Mr. MVP got an iPhone 8 plus, which was an upgrade from an iPhone 6s Plus so he lost his headphone jack. He is a runner, so dealing with headphone wires has never been his favorite thing, especially with our Aussie and her ability to get tangled up in anything that comes within 20 feet of her head, but adding a dongle to the equation was just too much. I looked at maybe fifty pairs of bluetooth headphones ranging in price from $200 to $20 and was so overwhelmed I almost just picked the most expensive pair and ended the insanity. These Senso headphones repeatedly showed up on lists from people who wanted a solid pair of bluetooth headphones for running that were both affordable and waterproof. I read through nearly every single review and and decided for $30 I could afford it if they did not work. Right out of the package, Senso proved the lists and reviews correct - $30 is sometimes a really good deal.What Mr. MVP really likes:1. The headphones themselves fit over his ears with the little loop which prevents any slipping while he is running. This is functional in the best way possible because his ears often don't hold on to headphones very well.2. He was able to change the earbud size because there were multiple sizes included in the package. The size that came preloaded was too big, so he popped them off and had a new perfectly fitted pair right there.3. The cord that attaches the two headphones may seem silly, but he actually uses this a lot. When he is getting ready for his run or when he has just returned home he can easily take the earbuds out of his ears and put them around his neck until he has his sneakers (on) off and has our Aussie settled.4. The whole thing was easy to pair to his phone. We have a bluetooth speaker that is an absolute nightmare to pair with our iPhones, but these took less than 30 seconds and I'm even thinking my Mom and Dad could easily do it.5. The headphones last about five days on one charge, which is a fairly long time. He runs one 5k every morning and walks two miles every night while listening to music or podcasts so having headphones that don't need to be charged every night is super convenient.6. They have really nice sound without completely dulling out the sound of the environment around him. He runs in a nature preserve, so hearing cars is not important (there aren't any), but hearing other people and animals is. He can turn his music up but still hear what is going on around him.What Mr. MVP does not like:1. He gets really sweaty - think wet - during his runs and having earbuds that came off that I could wash would be really nice. I know this pair of headphones is water resistant, but I'm thinking a pair of earbuds that I could wash with soap and water. This is more function than form.

When your looking for a product like this, unless you know somebody that owns this product, so hard to know, so hard to know (Trumpian).  SO you take a risk after reading the reviews that this product will work. Apple makes Bluetooth wireless earbuds, but OUCH! Expensive.  This set of buds works great. The fidelity of the music is very good for the price you pay.  You can answer your phone with it and people can hear your voice clearly.  Isn't that what we're looking for in a product like this?

Great headphones and great customer service!


So I picked these headphones up a couple of months ago to replace an older pair of Sony bluetooth headphones.  These are very lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  I was starting to use them daily and was really enjoying them.  Then suddenly the power button stopped working and the headphones would not power on.  I contacted Senso on Saturday and within minutes received a response to my request and started a conversation for receiving a replacement pair.  On Monday, my wife sends me a text while I am at work stating that my headphones had arrived.  Not only do I really like the headphones, but the customer service is incredible!  I will definitely be looking at getting other products from Senso!

Wow! What a great buy. They really did these headphones right. The noise cancellation is spot on, the quality of the sound is great. Once paired it will instantly pair again with your phone after turning it off and back on again.

When I bought these earbuds I wasn't expecting them to last more than 6 months. It has now been almost 3 years and I am still using them. They have literally been run over by a truck, submerged in a mud puddle, and worn in the shower (I do not recommend this)  and they are still going pretty strong. The only reason I'm ordering another pair is because there is a connection issue occasionally. Very impressed. Ordering again.

Customer service was outstanding!! They gave me directions how to reset Bluetooth to stop static. Also, in conversation I explained about the first pair breaking. The company has a 1 year warranty.

I got a pair of these a couple years ago and they were awesome. So awesome that when they finally crapped out, I didn't mind buying another pair. However, I found out with this new pair that the ear hooks are now totally different; they're huge and made with moldable rubber (probably to accomdate more ear sizes). The last pair fit perfect, but these are extremely difficult to get to fit right each and every time I wear them. Guess I'll just chalk them up as the millionth pair of headphones I've had that won't stay in my ears and restart a new search for the mythical pair that does...

DO NOT BUY THESE ID YOU WORKOUT AND SWEAT


Look. They sound great, are comfortable and are inexpensive, but they don’t last. I actually have went through many more pairs of these then the three in the picture as these broke after the warranty period so I couldn’t exchange them. I just spent the money and upgraded to AirPods. That all said, I do sweat a lot.

Sound great but battery only lasted a year - UPDATE - After factory reset now seem fine.


Really liked these earbuds.  Purchased in April 2017.  But now, just after a year, after a full charge immediately after connecting to my phone they start to beep and after 30-40 turn off and disconnect.  I guess the rechargeable battery only lasts so long.  Real shame as they had excellent sound quality.Update - After customer service suggested plugging unit in and holding down power button for seven seconds - Viola!  No more beeping.  Haven't tested them for several hours yet, but looks promising.  Back up to five stars!I ordered a replacement pair from Amazon that were on sale for $18 but they are really mediocre compared to the Senso.  Not even in the same league.  The Senso really have excellent bass.

Better then Dr.Dre beats.


Music earphones have proven to be great. I have used them at the gym and while in the steam room. I haven't ran into any issues as of yet it sucks that they want to review for their product within a week or less of purchase but like I said this product is great. By far better bang for your buck. Most people want to get those expensive 150 plus dollar earphones when you can just get these ones that are just as good at a fraction of the cost.

Annoying and subpar sound.


They sound ok, not great and when the battery is low the only warning you get is this annoyyyyyying voice ""battery low"" every like 10 seconds until you shut them off. Could get a % view on device would be a lot nicer. Also, bought them two months ago and now they cut out and beep every few seconds when I am listening to music even after charging and resetting. Very very very disruptive and irritating. Cool charging cord, but other than that really considering returning.

sound is good and the set up to use was simple


Just received these earbuds and have used a couple of times at gym...sound is good and the set up to use was simple. I like the case they have to store the earbuds in. Time will tell if they will last. I had a Phaiser brand that wore out 2x after about a year of use. Battery wouldn't charge. Like these as they are smaller and simple to use.

Won't be disappointed


So I'm a guy that looked for the cheaper price for some headphones to use to work out. I bought one for like $8, and it was alright, but then I decided to upgrade and looked and compared with other headphones around the same $30-$40 price range, and I couldn't be more happy. Everything in every way has been upgraded compared to my old $8 headphones, so I recommend you don't go for a cheap deal, it's worth the extra $25. Comes with a 1year warranty too

Love the new modifications


This is my second pair of Senso Headphones. The purchase was made because my daughter liberated the original ones from me. Really like these earbuds (maybe a  little more than the first par). The earhooks have been modified and they can now be molded around your ear for a much more secure fit when out on those runs. I never once had to readjust them because they were falling out. Hard to pass up for $23.

Where have these been all my life?


UPDATE 6/21/2018I want to start off by saying that I meant to do this update for some time now. Okay, here I go.... Unfortunately, I have to say that I am not happy with my replacement headphones (that I paid for with my own money) as, if you read the whole review, I had initially purchased because I thought the first one was broken.  So the very 1st pair that I bought continues to work like a charm.  However, the 2nd pair which I received February 4, 2018 has turned out to be absolute garbage.Even after I received the 2nd pair, I continued to use primarily the 1st one and didn't really use the 2nd one much.  So honestly it took me a awhile to notice that the 2nd pair, whenever I used it, would not work right.  It kept on losing the bluetooth connection.  This is how it would go.  I pair it to my phone, and less than a minute later, it's lost the connection.  I re-pair and the same thing.  However, since I have my original pair I would just go back to that and would chalk it up to maybe I forgot to charge the second pair.  Anyway, it wasn't until I had misplaced the 1st one and had to rely on the 2nd one that I noticed once and for all that it constantly loses its connection, it's not my phone or our home wifi, it's the headphone itself.  So now, I don't even bother using it as it's been nothing but a headache.I hate to have to report this but I have to be honest about my experience.Thus, my conclusion...I still don't regret having originally bought, the 1st pair anyway, which I still use.  However, I am just a little saddened that the backup that I had always planned to purchase is basically useless.  So, that's my 2 cents.Thanks for reading!!!*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************UPDATE:  2/27/2018I purchased these great earbuds back in December 2016 and proceeded to use them all the time.  I even used them in the shower as I had originally stated in my first review.  Well, about a month ago I thought that they had stopped working.  It started after a 2.5 hour jog/walk and of course by the end I was pretty sweaty.  So I had issues with it working properly after that and thought, oh great, my fault, I wasn't careful enough with these babies and decided to go ahead and purchase a second pair.  Well to my absolute delight, as I was waiting to get my second pair, which was a very short wait.  The company is really fast with shipping and they arrived in like 2 days.  Anyhow, I decided to try using my first pair again, I just wasn't ready to part with it even though I knew I had another one coming.  Now here's the delight part, it actually started working again.  Apparently, it just needed to dry out.  That's it.  It's working perfectly again.  So as I had initially intended to purchase a second pair anyway, I am just ecstatic.  These really are the best earbuds I have ever come across and I still continue to use these all the time in favor of other earbuds.  Also, I wanted to add as I hadn't reviewed how they work with phone calls before. I can truly say that they are great on that as well.  The sound quality on calls and the ease with answering and hanging up, such a breeze.  Additionally, pairing is also a breeze with connectivity occurring at around 5-7 seconds.  They charge very quickly as well.  If they are drained it may take about 2 hours or less to fully recharge, but half an hour goes a long way with these too .  Thus, I continue to be extremely happy with this company and this highly recommended, stellar, well made, quality item and I am very thankful to now have two of them.Once again I did not receive a penny for my review.  I gladly spent money out of my own pocket for these and like I said before, money well spent.  Thanks again Tekatron!!!Oh and I almost forgot.  The company, both times reached out to me by email, even one of the owners, just to check in on me and to see if I liked the product.  They made me genuinely feel that they wanted to make sure that, should I have any issues that I could easily contact them.  I truly appreciate their sincerity and I believe anyone reading this will too.  Thanks again, so loving this company!!!*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************First off let me start off by making it absolutely clear that I did not receive anything for my review.  I paid for these out of my own pocket.  Very very happy with my purchase by the way, but I’ll get to that shortly.Okay, let’s begin!  Where have these been all my life or atleast since bluetooth earbuds became a thing? I have never ever ever owned such a boss, primo, whatever word suits you, throw your own in there if you have these already because you know what I am talking about, pair of earbuds.  Earbuds, earbuds, I just cannot believe these are earbuds, these are A..M..A..Z..I..N..G!!!  I honestly resigned myself to simply average earbuds until I found these.  I can do somersaults over here, with them on.  They are so super snug, absolutely no slippage.  I always have trouble with that, always, but not with these.  They have literally become my go to.  I find myself making excuses to wear them.  Phone calls, listening to music (of course), workouts, playing games on my phone, to make it seem like I’m on a call even when I’m not because I am trying to not be bothered.  I even shower with them on, it’s like a spa experience.  No, I do not recommend this, please do not try this and if you do, leave me and the company out of it.  But these are just so good and incredibly comfortable!!!  Plus, the sound quality actually rivals that of some of my headphones.  Not listing any, not an audiophile, but trust me, I’m sure if you gave these a shot you would not be disappointed.  Even the battery life is pretty plentiful at a whopping 8 hours which knocks my Soundpeats out of the water at a supposedly 6 hours (they never really seemed to really last for that amount of time anyway).  Plus, the Peats were much more bulky in comparison to these pretty sleek buds.  And did I mention the bass?  How could I forget that?  That’s one of the main reasons why I am so shocked these are earbuds.  The bass is absolutely killer.  It’s just the right amount, not too heavy, not too low, just perfectly pound-erific bass.  I know pound-erific is not a word.  But these are so great I feel like Willy Wonka, Dr. Seuss, (whichever fits the bill), when I wear them and I can make up words.  I gain magical powers with the freedom and the pleasure that these provide me.  It’s like having a soundtrack to my life.  I obviously wear these a lot.  Please don’t judge me.  But it’s not just about the bass.  I listen to just about everything with these, and the sound is remarkable.  I find myself getting lost in the music, an absolute pleasure to my ears.  Even the packaging is top notch.  It comes with everything you need to get started.  You get not 1 but 2 super quality charging cables with covers.  Like I said top notch!!! You get a car charger, 3 ear tips, a wire tie, and a nice size, actually stylish case.  Also, my buds charged up really fast at only 1.5 hours and I was ready to go.  So very very happy with my purchase especially since I had my eyes on them for awhile and even more so that they ended up being so delightfully, deliciously, spenderificiously, (I know, not an actual word) lovely.  So, basically as I come to the end of my review, if you’ve made it this far, stop, go back to the top of the page and hit the add to cart button.  You deserve a happy purchase.  A happy purchase, what’s that?  Well let’s just say I would have gladly held up one of those signs on the side of the road for businesses trying to advertise, you know the people wearing the Statue of Liberty costume or in regular clothes, some spinning signs trying to get you to stop or go in to see a business.  If this company ever said they were giving these away as a promotion if you do this, even though I already own a pair, I would do it.  I really mean that, the company can hold me to it.Alright, having said that I will, finally, officially, conclude by stating that these were in fact my Christmas gift to myself to block out some holiday chatter.  Let’s just say they worked like a charm.  THANK YOU!!!!  So I say to SENSO, you rock, literally and THANKS so so much.  My life isn’t transformed but I can block more stuff out, they really are that great at noise-canceling.  Didn’t even know they would be great at that, but just another one out of the many great features of this product.  Amazon, THANK you so much for introducing me to SENSO!!!  One of my most happiest purchases, money so well spent that I plan on doing it again, (must have a backup pair or two).  Thanks so much for reading!!!  And finally, depending on where you are, good morning, good day and good night!

Good product &  horrible packaging: let’s talk


Overall I love love the headphones . Super comfy. Great price and good sound. I AM SUPER ANNOYED on how the packing was . I didn’t get the 2-in-1 charging cable that’s in the picture. It’s like don’t list a picture with stuff that’s not going to be in the box! Also the headphones charging cover was broken. Like wow. And not just that but I didn’t get the wire tie and the car charging adaptor cover was missing that says senso. Why ship a damaged product to a customer ? Luckily I was able to talk to amazon to help me.

Great sound compare to the big name brand.


So far been using it for a couple of months now and it gave me some problem with connectivity, contacted the company and they told me to reset the device. Plug it in to the charger and hold the on button then disconnect it and synced it to the phone again. Well I tried that and it didn't do me any good so I told them that and they are sending a replacement. Very pleasant experience.

I don't like earbuds, but I wanted some lightweight bluetooth headphones. These are much nicer than I expected. The battery lasts forever! I've had them for weeks and listened to hours of podcasts. I've only had to charge them twice. The foam earbuds are much more comfortable than the squishy plastic that is typical for in ear heaphones. Overall, I am really pleased with these!

I gave this to my mother for listening to sermons and phone calls while walking. She likes them as they fit comfortably and work well.

High Quality, Easy to Pair, Excellent Sound


I use these with my iPhone to listen to Audible books while I take the dog for a walk. I like that they are stereo.

They come with a nice case and a few other accessories as well. Recommended.

(Woah!!) Great quality


I was hesitant on buying these pairs, as I had never heard of the brand but every other review said they were good. My other concern was buying good wireless headphones that would not fall out of my ear and nicely wrap around my small ear. And these headphones delivered!! Immediately trying them out, the volume and noise cancelling ability was better than expected. This is a great buy!! Plus, for those concerned of the earpiece, it is adjustable to bend to you please, a surprising feature.

They fit fine and worked great for the first few months.Now they pair with my devices but for the first minute have a skipping sound that makes the audio unlistenable.After the minute they work fine.Buttons work great and battery life is pretty good for small size.If not for the skipping I would give 5 stars but this is very annoying.

Sound is good; flexible ear hooks are nice & keeps them in place; the cord is flat so if you wear them with the cord on the back of the neck while working out the cord does stick, it would be nice if they came with a cord clip to clip to the back of your shirt; used with an iPhone the volume control syncs with the volume level on the iPhone - love that!  But the volume level at the lowest setting is already pretty loud.

Awesome Sound & Great Value at This Price Point!


These earphones have great sounds but you need to change a bit on the equalizer to bring out the capabilities of these earphones. The sounds are great at this price point and the amazing sound isolation is big plus!I use these earbuds mainly for working out in the gym and they are water resistant enough for them to get some sweat on them and not have any issues.Battery last about 6-8 hours worth of listening time.They are overall great sounding earphones and offer great value for what you pay them for!

Great sound, quality and price...


I have only had these headphones for a short amount of time, but straight out of the packaging I started listening to music within seconds. Immediately had a 5 hour listening session trying to find something that didn't sound good on these headphones, listened to everything from hip hop to metal to salsa to merengue and everything in between and everything sounded crisp, clear, and loud even without cranking the volume. And also most importantly the headphones never were uncomfortable even having them on for the 5 hours straight. ""These are the best headphones you can get, even better than other expensive ones.""

My inner ears must be the smallest of anyone ever.  This is my third set of earbuds.  These are closer than any others but they still do not stay in my ear.  When I push down on them, the sound is amazing, but they won't stay down. The hooks over the ears are a little tricky also.  I wear glasses so that interferes with the hooks.

Terrific for the price


So far, these headphones are just what was needed.  The sound is fantastic.  They fit in/around the ear easy and comfy with very little weight.  Recharge time is fast and the operation is easy.  The only negative is the microphone quality, but that's not what they're primarily made for.  The person on the other end of the call hears some miscellaneous noises, like frequent clicking, that is a little distracting.  However, they can clearly hear the speaker's voice even with the microphone all the way up in the ear.  The bonus charging cords and dual car charging plug are a definite plus.  I would buy them again if another family member needs a pair.

I didn't expect much for the low price, just needed a wireless earbud  that would wrap around the ear so it wouldn't fall off.. They were louder than I expected with pretty good sound to boot.

Very good for the price.  Holds a good charge for 5 or 6 hours. Sound is surprisingly good.  Bass is lacking a bit so I knocked off 1 star.

Maybe not sweatproof


I bought these and loved them, great sound, easy to work long battery life and then.....After using no more than 10 times the battery life went way down, one workout and they needed to be charged again.  Then they didn't even last through one 45 minute workout, and now they won't start at all.  I'm not sure my head sweats a lot so maybe they aren't as sweat proof as you might think.

Get 'Em!


I recently purchased a pair of SENSO Bluetooth Headphones for my mom, and I own a pair myself. I really like these headphones. The sound is great and the bass is deep when it should be. Phone calls are clear and crisp and there is no outside noise. They fit very well and are really comfortable. Plus I don't have to worry about messing them up when i'm working out as they are sweat-proof/waterproof. And to top it off, included with the headphones are two charging cables, a bunch of ear buds, and a car charger with two USB ports, which is so convenient to me!

Headphones worked good for about a month but the headphone that powers it up fell apart. I had it in my hoodie pocket and when I took it out the backing was missing. How does it just fall apart?

Good, but No noise Cancellation....


I like the headphones. They seem to last and be somewhat durable, but my biggest issue is there is no noise cancellation on the headphones. So yes, I have hands-free talking and they work well while I'm running, sweating and working out, but when I talk on the phone (which I do a lot), I always have to transfer the sound back to my phone, because the headphones pick up every bit of sound around me and anyone I'm talking to always complains how they are unable to hear me. This is deeply frustrating since I am always on the go and me being able to talk hand-free is the main reason I purchased these headphones.

Awesome headphones without breaking the bank


LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!! I am considering getting another pair since my husband keeps stealing them from me. Sound quality and noise cancellation is better than I expected at this price point. We've had them for a few months now and I still love them. Comfortable to wear and stay in place throughout my workouts and when I am cleaning up around the house.

Good buy


Especially for the price, these is a great par of headphones.  Comfortable to wear and the sound is best in the highs and lows - midrange is so-so.  Unfortunately, I was hoping to use them under my full-face motorcycle helmet.  There is no way I can get the helmet on with these in my ears.  The quest for decent sound on 2 wheels continues.

Set your expectations this is a very good product, but not great. Good quality sound but not great. Very easy to connect via bluetooth. Wonderful fit for activity. Nice lightweight, easy to charge.

This is my 5th BT headset and the first one to actually stay connected to the phone (HTC 10) almost regardless of how I move. Every other set stutters often enough if I look around while walking that they all sit unused because that's what I bought them for. Also the included memory foam cushions are awesome.

So far so good


I only gave four stars, because I just received the headphones, and only used them once so far. I can say during the first use that they worked great. Sound was loud and clear enough for me, and I loved not having the long wires from traditional headphones.The headphones cut out only a handful of times, for a short short second, but this did not really bother me at all, as it was not a long buffering glitch. I was cutting the grass with my phone in a pocket.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase as of now.

These headphones are amazing for the price. They are a little bit bassy and you lose a little bit of the high end, which is why I only put 4 stars. I use them for running and so that is fine by me. Everything else about these are amazing. They stay in place well and the controls right on the head phones are great so I don't have the fiddle with my phone while running.

Love these! Another BT set I paid the same for fell apart after 30 days. These are well designed and made. The on off button is large, red and positioned by itself on the side of the right earpiece, easy to feel and impossible to mix up with the other controls. Linking to devices is automatic. Sound is very good. These come with a bunch of earbud shapes and sizes, a longer and shorter charging cable and a 2 port USB for your car. The longer cable converts from mini USB to iPhone 6 tip, so you can charge your phone and the earphones at the same time. Not sure how long the charge lasts - at least 90 minutes. This all comes in a nifty little zipper case.

in a world where people enjoy spewing vitriol


in a world where people enjoy spewing vitriol, i am so happy to give this product 5 stars. It's a bit of a saga but I really want to share. Ordered these ~Oct 2016, used happily for about 2 months. Suddenly the battery drained rapidly everytime i used them, for about a week. I reached out to the company, they were extremely responsive. They were happy to replace them & have me send my faulty pair back in for investigation. The second pair has been working flawlessly for over a month now...in fact, the battery life is already beating the original pair. 5x 1.5 hr workout sessions before reaching battery low state. So both on product & especially on customer service - i highly recommend this product. Fwiw, my son also bought a pair after looking at airbuds & beats - he now admits, this was an extremely smart purchase.

Would recommend for ear buds.


I bought these to use in bed. I prefer headphones but cannot lay my head on a pillow. So my four stars is only because of my personal choice.The buds fit well once you figure out what size adapters to use for your ears. The sound is great and they are comfortable in bed.You need to pay attention to charging, one charge usually last me two to three days. I have gotten in the habit of plugging them in when I get up in the morning.

Best sounding earbuds


Best sounding earbuds I have ever owned. Have had several wired and bluetooth sets. Sound ranges are clear and accurate. The buds fit my ears (small) with no noticeable discomfort. I do not have to stuff them way into my ears to get clear sound as with other sets. Great value for the price. The only problem I have thus far is I can see the indicator light reflection in my glasses at night. Still giving a 5 star. Thanks for a great product!

Cheap, poor design, poor tech.


To pair a second device you have to go into the first device and disconnect it and then go back to the headphones and pair the second one.The sound quality is bad and doesn't block out background noise. The earphones are fidgety to put on. It's difficult to know if they are on or off so you might leave them on and the battery dies. Just terrible and cheaply built.

So at first I gave this product a 5 star rating. However through use the quality is apparent. This thing doesn't hold a charge worth a nickle.. it takes a little over an hour to charge then gets worn out after approximately 6 hours of use.

They sound great, BUT!


It is ironic they have sport in the name, I take these jogging and they don't stay in the place. The ear hooks are too flimsy and as you move the earbuds will lose their seal with your ear and you don't get the best sound.Otherwise greta audio for bluetooth buds, solid build quality, long battery life, and the accessories are a nice bonus. BUT not for working out.

I purchased these headphones to replace a pair that had stopped working (would no longer synch up).  The previous set was probably over a year old, but honestly I really don't remember exactly when I got them.  In any case, I liked them enough that I got another set even though the first set eventually failed.  I enjoyed them enough, and the price was reasonable enough that I felt that I had gotten my money's worth.  I'm hopeful that this pair will last longer.

I'm not a review guy but I wanted to leave one because after about 4 months of having and really enjoying these headphones the power button broke or stopped working. It seemed like it had lost the ability to make contact with the components inside. Anyway, I contacted Senso through their website received a response within one hour of submitting my claim apologizing for the problem. They requested my order number confirmed that they were still under warranty and shipped a new pair out the same day, no questions asked.This is what I consider great customer service and a company standing by their product.

Great for the price!


****Update #2 - It is now July 2019, I purchased my first pair in 2017 and loved them. Last week I dropped them and stepped on it smashing it into pieces. Whoops! I purchased set #2 and I am very happy to see they have made this product even better than before. The fit seems more snug (in a good way) and the sound seems a bit more advanced as well. The only thing that irked me was when you turn it on and off, my previous one would say ""connected"" or ""disconnected"". It now says ""your headset is connected"" or "" Your headset is disconnected"". It's a simple stupid thing and if I didn't have it the other way before I don't think it would have bothered me as much. Still, i'm very happy with it overall.*** Update- I have had these almost a full year (it's the end of Aug 2018) and still use them daily without issue***I purchased these back in September 2017 and they work pretty good with my apple watch. I am able to run and workout without carrying multiple products like Mp3 players that fall out of my pockets, etc..Some minor things I have had issues with: 1. When I first connect it works fine but if click on a work out mode on my watch it ""skips"" and I have to turn it off and turn it back on and reconnect. It is always fine after that. Since I am used to it and expect it I just set it before I start working out. It doesn't do this any other time, it also connects to my Skype work meetings, etc..without issues.2. They fit better than any other headphones I have ever used, that being said my right ear must be wonky because when I run it will become lose and I keep having to fix it. My left ear doesn't have the same issue so I guess it's me not you.I previously corrected this by using an ""ear hook"" but it's so small and I eventually lost it somewhere in the abyss....When it's cold and I wear a beanie it stays perfectly.Does this work, absolutely!I would definitely buy this again, for the price you can't beat it.

The left side just shorted out the other day after a year of light use. I never got them wet or anything, just used them when I would go on runs. Of course, this is just past the warranty window of this product. For the price, these things should last more than a year. Unless you want to buy a new pair each year, I recommend shopping for a higher quality pair elsewhere.

Excellent sounds quality; stay put throughout various activities; are comfortable.

Worked even for a funny shaped ear and the sound is great !


when I first threw these on I realized they weren't going to fit my left ear (stage one microtia on my left ear ) but I threw on the large ear bud /eartip and just wrapped the ear hook a little farther back and it works better then the one for the right ear :) (you get three ear tips small, medium and large). I went from upset because of my funny ear to ecstatic because in the end it all worked out and the sound is great.  I'm able to run with them on and the sound is great. I'm listening to Paula Temple at Berghain which has a lot of bass and it sounds really awesome. Im not worried that one of these will fall out since they are connected by a wire.

Too good to be true


I should have known the price was too good to be true. These headphones looked nice, the case was awesome, and they paired quickly with my watch. Then the positives ended, I took them to the gym and tried to put them on, they immediately fell off. I guess I have abnormally small ears, as the hooks to go around your ears sat way too high to stay behind my ears, I had to shove the bulb part in my ear to have them stay in (very uncomfortable). Then I had to turn the sound to max to hear my music which was disappointing. After that load of discontent, one minute into my stretching, my music cut out, this happened every 10-20 seconds, followed by an annoying voice saying “connected”. Needless to say I was furious, the only thing these were good for was to piss me off so much I was throwing weights around with anger and ease due to my instant rage trying to listen to my workout music.Let’s start with the positive of these headphones- They come in a nice case- Easy to use- Quick connectThe cons- They are way too big (kept falling out of my ears the hooks were too big and high to wrap around my ears, I wish they were adjustable)- Pretty bulky in design- They never stay connected, every ten seconds the song stops and it disconnects from my device

Simply the best headphones you can buy, and the bargain price is just icing on the cake


These headphones have been everything that I've wanted, and more. I don't normally post reviews, but after searching for a nice pair of wireless headphones, these turned out to be not only an amazing value, but as good as my much more expensive Beats. I've had them for a week, and don't have a complaint. They are clear, have decent base, and have lasted the advertised 6-8 hours on every charge. I still can't believe the price-point. You not only get the headphones, but you get a car charger, as well as a lightning cable, that is also a charger for the headphones, as well as a nice case, and another charger. Don't waste your time with any other headphones. These are not only worth your time, but your money.

Really convenient to use. bass and treble are out of balance. Sad, I lost them the 3rd day I had them so I don't remember if the bass was too weak or too strong. I think too strong, not sure. I was listening to Adele, Jazz, classical piano and Heat Wave to try them out. Still if you are looking for hands off use, it is great for that, but if you are using them for music, try something else.

Bluetooth Constantly Loses Connection for No Reason


Sound quality is good, but the bluetooth constantly loses connection for no reason on multiple devices, literally when the device is in your hand. If you raise your arms over the head, like doing pull ups at the gym, connection is gone. Not only does the connection to the bluetooth go out, sometimes the headphones turn off completely. If I could give 1 star I would. This problem began about 3-4 months ago. It would be nice if a full refund could be issued, because I'd expect headphones to last for more than 9 months.

The best things I can say for these headphones... light, good sound, easy to pair to my phone, decent price.  What I hate...they pop/skip while playing.  I made sure they were fully charged.  I reset them to the factory default setting.  Paired them again. Tried to play my music on them again and they still pop/skip on occasions.  Very annoying.  It may take several minutes but it's going to happen.  They also lose their power rather quickly.  I can appreciate that I may have bought a defective pair but I bought two pairs at the same time and I just can't take a chance on the second pair.  You get one chance to have me as a consumer and that's it.

I'm still testing these out...currently having a problem with the left one staying in my ear- this was while i was wearing around house - cleaning it up. im interested mainly in how good they are when i run. What i do love about them is the very soft ear wrap...if you are wearing a hat - it's much more comfortable than the hard kind but at the same time it might be too soft to stay in place. stay tuned.

Updated*** Would not buy again. They headphones have been good so far


Updated review: My original pair of headphones died before the 1 year warranty. The company was great to deal with an exchange their customer service is A+ all the way. However the new pair of headphones barely holds a charge. They don't last for more than two hours at a time. Would not purchase again.They headphones have been good so far. They are easy to use and comfortable. However, the battery life is nowhere near 8 hours. After using mine for 2 hours they died. Recharged them until it said they were completely charged and they only last about 3 hours. The sound quality is pretty good as well.

Good for its price


It’s good. Does what it claims to. Didn’t personally notice sound cancellation. But it’s better than some of the others on the market for the same price. Someone else said it best: don’t spend more on another set claiming to do the same things these do. It’s not worth it. Just buy these.

I purchased these on ""sale"" and I can say that they are definitely worth $40, but probably not too much more. I use them primarily for the gym and they work fine. Cons are that you can hear wind noise while running (unless you turn them up), some connectivity issues such as distortion (sound comes in choppy at times but only 5% of the time), and they aren't the BEST at staying firmly in place. Pros are that these are affordable, they are packaged well and come with a lot of usable items (car charger, 2 charging cables [one with Apple Lighting adapter], replacement/different size earpieces, and carrying case; but no charging square) and look somewhat ""stylish."" If you are tired of wired headphones, do not have $200+ to spend on a name brand earphone, and do not need to use them all day, these are for you.

Really like the headphones


Really like the headphones. You get what you paid for and so much more. In the description it warned you that they don't work very well if you're not within a three foot radius however a couple feet here or there doesn't make too much of a difference and I like that. They do tend to fall off a little bit if I try running however I think that just has something to do with my ears rather than the headphones themselves. Sound quality is really great, it can even block out surrounding noises. Perfect for working out. Easy to use and charge. I'd definitely recommend to someone looking for bluetooth headphones.

Most Bang for your Buck!


I was very pleasantly surprised by these headphones. You can not beat the price and everything you get for it. They come with a great carrying case, multiple sized earbuds options, and a car hanger option. They were easy to sync with my iPhone, and are easy to use. The sound is great quality, and they do a great job canceling outside noise. My husband liked them so much that he wants me to buy him a pair. I highly recommend these headphones.

These were great while they lasted


These were great while they lasted. The sound was great, fit was fine and I was impressed with all the accessories that came with these. However I bought them in mid December and at just a bit over two months now in February they have completely died. Literally just died which is why I'm writing this review because I loved these so much and am annoyed. I was listening to music when suddenly the music stopped, there was a sizzle sound and then silence. I plugged them into the charger and no lights or anything. I'll contact customer support but if you're thinking about buying these cross your fingers you get a good pair that wont die.

Not for very small ears


They pair just fine with my iPhone and the sound is fine. The controls are easy to use. But they are going back because I cannot get them to stay on. I have very small ears and though the earbuds fit fine, the ear piece is too large for me and they are a struggle to keep on. Because comfort was my biggest issue they don’t work well for me at all.

These are easily the best Bluetooth earbuds I've encountered for the price. The quality is obvious right out of the box. They're comfortable, lightweight, and well made. The sound quality — for Bluetooth buds under $40 — is pretty darned solid. For instance, did you know that most musical recordings have bass in them? I didn't, until now. Highly recommended!

OK for walking and jogging. Lasted 1/2 year. ROI is not acceptable.


Bought them to use while biking. They shake off while riding over rough terrain. While riding over smooth pavement: sound is OK, controls are OK, comfort level OK. The right headset cover (the one that holds an on-off switch etc) fell off after approximately 15 rides. So these phones ended costing me 36.97/15=2.50 a ride.

The quality was decent and the fit was pretty comfortable/secure. However


Overall, these headphones are OK but have some big problems. The quality was decent and the fit was pretty comfortable/secure. However, the connection with devices is awful. After a few weeks, I have to disconnect and reconnect with my phone every time I turn the headphones on for it to work, and they used to be able to connect to laptops/computers with some more effort but now no matter what I do it won't connect with computers. Additionally, the mic doesn't work well in calls, and the battery already is down to around 5-6 hours max after a few weeks.I would only recommend this if price is the one biggest factor, but overall it's not worth it.

Senso bluetooth headphone review


I have recently used the senso headphones and was satisfied with the product. The materials it is made of should hold up over time unless abused. With that being said this is my first wireless headphone set so I do not have any others to compare these too.I currently use these headphones with my Samsung 7 Edge and listen to music when working out or running. I use a armstrap that holds my phone in place while working out.. With this being said I have noticed that the connection between the bluetooth and the phone isn't the best when running if phone is placed on my left arm. The right ear bud is where the bluetooth is located. I am going to assume that the bluetooth is meant to be less than 6 foot away from the wireless source although I can get a bad connection from 4 foot.

Sound continuously and unbearably cuts out shortly after buying


I really wanted to like these - when I first took them out of the package maybe every 30 minutes or so the sound would cut out. No matter I thought maybe I just need to break them in. I usually run outside and connect these to my iphone without any other electronics on me. Initially there would just be small blips in which the sound cut out but over the last few weeks they have become every few minutes and it's impossible to concentrate on running since the sound keeps cutting out. I had bought these in hopes that I would be able to use them in a race a week and a half from now. However with the sound cutting out so much and being such a distraction I honestly cannot recommend these to any distance runners or anyone who wants a solid pair a headphones for a multi hour run.I had tried multiple things to remedy the headphones such as keeping them fully charged, reconnecting to my phone's bluetooth multiple times, restarting my phone, restarting the headphones, and nothing worked. I'm not sure if this pair is defective or what but the 30 day return period is now over and I'm pretty bummed out that I don't have a good pair of headphones for my race in two weeks and that I had spent quite a bit of money on a defective product. The sound quality however was good while it lasted, and it did stay in my ears pretty comfortably. I have only used these maybe 15-20 times exclusively for running and other gym activities.

Not bad for the money


I've struggled to find the ideal Bluetooth earphones/buds for exercise. After reading a range of reviews on the Senso I purchased these figuring that they were worth the risk for the price. The good: they fit, are comfortable, and they stay in place. That has not always been a given for me. Their construction and quality of materials is reasonable. Bluetooth connection is solid as long as the paired device is very close. Not surprisingly with distance (> 5 ft) things get a little flaky.  The sound quality is mediocre and this is probably the only drawback, and again, given the price, not surprising.  Compared to cheepo buds, it's quite good but it's too much to hope that it will compare to Bose or Klipsch or any really high quality headphones/buds.

Good BT Earbuds for Jogging


My Powerbeats2 died after soaked by sweat for a year. I think any BT earbuds with a volume control on the strap is susceptible to sweat damage. This one do not have an volume control that is on the strap. I hope it will last. The sound quality is ok, at least for jogging. The ear hooks are a little big and loose for me but I can manage. Pairing seems to be a little slow (comparing to the much more expensive Powerbeats2). Sometimes, I need to re-connect to make my phone switch audio to the earbuds. Overall, it works for me. Could be a great deal for the price if it lasts. I will find out.

Very Good Headphones (after my original bad set was replaced)


Update 2018-04-30: Received a replacement about 12 days after my last update when I brought the problem to the attention of the manufacturer. They were very understanding and easy to work with. They asked for an explanation, we worked through some steps to attempt to address the issue on my side with no luck. They then issued a replacement that took about 10 days from our last communication to show up. The best part is that my first set must have been worse than expected because the new set is not overwhelming on the bass side of the spectrum and is functioning as expected with a good battery duration and great sound. I'm much happier with this set and would recommend them to anyone.Update 2018-03-27: The battery died. These no longer function. They don't take a charge and don't turn on. The multi-function button to turn them on is easily pressed when they're stored in their case and they've been turned on unexpectedly too. I wouldn't recommend these headphones. I'm going to contact the manufacturer to replace them since they're in the 12-month warranty period and update this review with the details.These are great headphones. The silicon earbuds kept falling out and I would have rated them one star if they were the only earbuds with the product but they have foam earbuds as well and they fit perfectly.I would have given them a 5-star rating but the sound has overwhelming bass that requires that I go into the settings of my phone and bring down the entire left side of the equalizer from 1 kHz band. I have other Bluetooth speakers that connect to my phone and they all produce the same high sound quality that I can keep my ""V"" equalizer pattern with and enjoy my music. These headphones require the reduction of bass. They do have crisp clear treble but it's difficult to hear it because of the bass level.

set up was easy--linked right up. stays put through running and cycling with the one exception: Keep and use the cord tie. The long connecting cord is 'tangle free' version, thick and sticks to your neck when you turn your head during a workout--pulls the headphone out. Adjust the length to keep the cord snug and its fine. sound is great. Definitely noise cancelling so keep your head on a swivel in traffic.

I just got these and have only used them a few times but so far they seem to be a great set of ear buds. I have a terrible time with ear buds staying in my ear and these seem like they would stay even without the over the ear piece. The sound is good and they were very easy to pair and start using.

Purchased these about 8 months ago and they suddenly would no longer charge. It's not that they wouldn't hold a charge, it's that they would not charge period. I ended up calling their 24/7 365 tech support and they walked me through a few steps before confirming that they needed to send me a new pair. While I wasn't happy about the fact that they failed in less than a year, I WAS happy the customer support experience an treatment I received and that they were without question, honoring the 1-year warranty. Hopefully, these will last a bit longer than the first pair.

Sound quality is good and it's easy to use


Sound quality is good and it's easy to use. The downside I have is the over ear pieces and fitting. Now it comes with extra earbuds in attempt to fit all ears which is nice but if you press in more to secure them it can muffle the sound quality slightly. The over ear pieces and very rubbery. Don't really give support at all but they do stop them from completely falling off the ear if they buds come loose. Haven't had any connectivity issues and the battery life does pretty well. Plus it charges with a mini usb that most phones, aside from iPhones, use so it can be easy to find a place to plug it in.

Great headphones. Bought them in January and for some reason in November the left side started cutting out. They were still under warranty so I contacted Senso expecting the run around or a long drawn out process to try to get replaced. Wrong! Sent in an email and had a response within an hour. They asked me to hard reset which didn’t solve the problem. They next confirmed my address and told me a new pair was ordered for me. That was Monday. It’s wednesday and I’m back rocking to my music on the headphones. Two day turn around on warranty replacement! Unheard of!  Fan for life!

Lowest volume was still too loud, bulkiness of headphones causes constant whooshing sound from air hitting it while running


Big and bulky, even on the lowest setting the music was too loud for me. It's probably set that way because the bulkiness of the headphones causes a constant whooshing sound from air hitting the headphones and the sound being transferred into your ears, so the music needs to be set louder in order to hear it above the whooshing sound? Returned.

A bit misleading with handsfree dialing, but GREAT product


Hey everyone.I purchased these because I drive a lot and my car doesn't have Bluetooth capability. In my state, it  is very frowned upon to hold your phone up while driving so a Bluetooth headset was the best option. Big beats headphones would certainly have gotten the job done but for driving I don't think total noise cancellation is such a good idea. These seem to serve my purposes fine. As other reviewers have stated, this product has very good sound and feels soft and comfortable. The design is appealing to any one who moves frequently, whether you're a house wife who's got to clean room to room all day or a professional runner.BUT: Because I purchased this product for driving purposes, hands-free dialing was the feature that ultimately lead me to buy these. The hands-free dialing is very misleading. They have a feature where you can hit the main button twice to dial the last number you called, and that's it. There is no voice dialing., so you'd better hope that the last person you called is the next person you want to call or else you're going to have to ask Siri/Cortana/Ok Google.The good news is if you've got hands free dialing on your cell phone you can use the feature without pressing any buttons. For instance, I've got an iPhone  6s that allows me to ""Hey Siri"" without pressing a button, and that feature on the iPhone translates fine to the Bluetooth headset. Overall I'm really pleased. I'm also posting pictures of the instruction manual in case anyone wants to take a glance at the features before they purchase. Cheers!

You can't do better than these!


Simply the BEST bluetooth headphones I've ever worn!  Had previously owned a Jabra bluetooth headset, but had a few issues with them and they were NOT very loud. Then bought a set of Dre PowerBeats 3 to replace them, but those damn things would not pair to my Sandisk MP3 player, and neither the Apple geeks or PowerBeats Technical Support could wrap their heads around the issues, so I returned them and bought these. These are incredible! The feel great, they stay in place when I'm moving around, and they rock the sound! Why spend $150 for Dre's when these are less than a third of the price, pairs with everything bluetooth, and has the same or better sound quality as the Dre's? DON'T!

Amazing..


Amazing ... If you are looking for some good quality headphones stop looking and buy these ... They have amazing sound quality, super easy to pair, and are very easy to operate. They come with instructions that explain everything you need to know about these little guys. The fit is also very good and stay in my ears with no problem and come with 4 different ear pieces ... Honestly I don't think I could find another pair and be as pleased as I am with these ... Probably going to order a second pair just for a back up in case mine get lost or stolen. Also can't forget to mention the customer service with this company!! They will be contacting you before you even receive these puppies in the mail just in case your not happy with something when they arrive .... Yeah I'm speechless !!!!

For the price these are great!


For the price these headphones are amazing. The sound quality is alright but for 30 dollars you can't really complain, also they are completely noise cancelling. The ear hooks are a pretty flimsy but surprisingly they stay on your ears even during intense workouts. I've done plyometric workouts and weightlifting and they never fell off. The battery life is also pretty great, you can have the volume up loud and they last 8 hours which is two more hours than most other brands. These also come with a carrying case, 3 different ear tips, two charging cords, and a car charger. This is a great deal and I definitely recommend them to anyone who wants a good pair of Bluetooth headphones and not spend hundreds of dollars.

Disappointed. Buy Anker SoundBuds NB10 instead


Updates (1/25/2017): Just got Anker SoundBuds NB10 and found it a incomparably better than this SENSO especially in terms of sound and hold. I STRONGLY suggest not getting SENSO. Choose Anker or LG instead. Many of the reviews giving five-stars are not trustworthy.--This is my third Bluetooth head set. It works for music listening and telephone conversations but I'm not very happy with the overall quality.As compared to my another one,  LG Tone Pro HBS-750, which is in the same price range as of Jan 2017, I would say(1) The quality of treble sound is very limited(2) The microphone picks up much more noise, making telephone conversations hard.(3) It easily comes off when jogging outdoor due to against wind.The last point may not be a big problem for treadmill runners, but the hold won't be very satisfactory for most of outdoor joggers.

Husband loves them


Husband uses them to work out every day and while doing all yard work. He says the sound is great , yes he sweats up at storm in 90-100 degree weather too and they still work like day one .

Wrap around ear pieces misaligned. Won't stay in ear.


I am returning these. The piece that wraps around the left ear is misaligned-- so it keeps falling off the ear. You can tell that it's not aligned correctly when you compare it to the right piece-- the right piece curves in more so that it wraps closer around the ear (see attached picture).  They're not moldable so you can't manipulate it to to the shape of your ear. Also, when I was trying to adjust them on my ears, the sound kept cutting out. I think their quality control needs to be reviewed.

Solid headphones.


Very easy to pair and sound great. The rubber ear loops are helpful but don't seem to really do much to keep them in my ear. I wish they fit a bit more snuggly. I tried a few of the different adapters but the default size were the best. Well made and a long lasting charge. Good for grilling or working around the house but would not stay in the ears well enough for running or other more strenuous activities.

Very happy with purchase


I ordered these because I wanted to have a set of earphones for my daily hike that didn't have a cord that got all tangled up.  I was concerned about the over the ear clip, since in my experience that type of earphones was uncomfortable.  The ear clips on these SENSO headphones are made out of a soft rubber that is very comfortable.  They easily stay in my ears.  The sound is great.  I've had no trouble with the Bluetooth connection.  They connected quickly and automatically to my iPhone 6S as soon as I turned them on.  I am very pleased with my purchase.

Not good for running with Apple Watch on left hand


These work well with my iPhone 8 Plus, but I primarily bought them for running and listening to music off my Apple Watch series 3 and in that function they are luckluster at best. I have to wear my watch on my right hand. I have gone through the troubleshooting steps to resolve the breaking up I experience when running with my watch on my left hand. I am still searching for another headphone to run and listen to music off my Apple Watch on my left hand.

I've had these headphones for just over a year (not covered by the 1 year warranty now) and they no longer work. When they did work, they were great. For the last month they would occasionally not turn on. And then it would keep connecting to my phone, then disconnect, then connect again.

I work as a stock clerk at a large grocery store. Before the customers arrive we can wear headphones, but working with your hands a lot and moving was a real problem for wired headphones. I had a pair of Beats, but didn't care much for the sound quality. They seem kinda designed to deliver very bassey music. I thought I would try this brand. They are much crisper and more clear. The sound is awesome and the battery life last through my eight hour shift. The price is great and the quality even better.

Great performance, with a few snags holding it back.


I'm usually a fan of headphones, but these earbuds work great. They're lightweight, loud, and hold a good charge. The sound quality is pretty good, but lacks the fullness you get from traditional headphones, but the just personal preference. The only issues I've encountered are that the rubber ear peice that hooks the ear isn't adjustable and just a little too big for my ears. Plus the rubber material it's made of, especially when you have only one ear peice in, get caught on the back of my neck and tugs at my ear whenever I turn my head. Small gripes that you don't think of at first but can take a while to adjust to.

I recently purchased my SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones and was surprisingly satisfied with my purchase. I own many pairs of headphones, both wired and wireless and these headphones may just be about the best I own. The usual lot either hurt your ears or don't fit very well. These fit almost perfectly.

Great fit, so comfortable I actually wore them in the shower after my workout by mistake.  Sound quality is excellent for the money.  I wear these lifting 6 days a week and have had no problems with them at all and have had them for a few weeks now.  They pair right up to my phone or computer, I am actually wearing them right now at work and they are connected to both my laptop and my phone.  Overall I would say a great buy.  The case is also very handy it keeps the wires from getting all tangled up in my pocket by gremlins.  I have had others and have had issues charging them or keeping a charge, these do seem a little more rugged and hold a charge for several hours.  Highly recommend.  The charger cord that came with them for your phone did suck, I just tossed it but hey I didn't buy the headphones for the free junk - just the headphones and the charging cord for them.

Best budget bluetooth headphones


Pros: Sound quality awesome for the cost, battery life as good as advertised if not better, controls are intuitive and pairing is easy, price is awesome for what you get, comes with lots of bonus gadgets which I appreciated, fit is comfortable and it comes with enough different sized buds that you should be able to find one that's right for you.Cons: I think this is only a problem for me because I have had it with most headphones, but if you sweat into your ears on longer runs they will slide out a bit and you have to push them back into your ear to get good sound.  With the extra over ear bit though, they never actually fall off and it's a minor incovenience... frankly I had to reach like crazy to come up with anything negative to say at all!

Get what you pay for.


The headphones are decent, but they are bulky and the part that goes around your ear could use a thicker wire in it for some more ridgidity. The headphones weigh a decent enough amount that you need a more solid wire in there to form around your ear and hold them in place.Definitely can’t run with these in your ears, they’ll fall out.

Ok, some small annoyances


I primarily bought this as a replacement for another well-known brand around the same price that I lost. I bought these for the over ear loops (as I jog) and better battery life. However battery life anecdotaly does not seem to be quite as good as claimed. Sound is not as good as comparable brands for the same $ and the connection speed on iPhone 7 (iOS 11.4.1) is 7 seconds.

My headphones showed up promptly and everything works well.  I wore them at work and once to go running so far and I have to say that I am impressed.  After getting them connected to my phone they are pretty much hands free and I haven't noticed any issues with the Bluetooth cutting out.  They fit well and I haven't had any issue with them falling out (my last set was terrible for this and is what prompted me to buy this pair).

These work well and are much more comfortable than my last pair of wireless earbuds.  My only complaint is that they are not ""noise cancelling,"" as advertised.  I'm not all that upset about it though.  If you're looking for top-of-the-line features and quality you aren't in the market for $30 earbuds like these.

The experience with the seller was fine, box arrived in perfect shape and all as described. My only concern at this point is that the headphones start to ""skip"" (I don't know how else to describe it) after 30 or 40 mins of use even after a full charge. I replied to a message I received Tekatron with this information shortly after the purchase but have not yet heard anything back. Other than that, these have great (probably the best) sound I have heard from a wireless head set.

Allows one to accomplish more throughout the day.


I didn’t like that we had to turn off Bluetooth on 5 other devices but oh well. I love the sound quality. I use them intermittently throughout the day so I never know how much battery life I have left. It usually quits when I’m taking the dog for a walk the next day after I charged them☹️  I’m fairly certain they hadn’t been used for a total of 8 hours but who knows?! I love the freedom they give me to do my activities around the house. I can still listen to my audio books but not be tethered to one spot.

You can do better...


These things were terrible. Battery life was mediocre. The problem was connecting. It would say “paired”. It would not be paired... I would have to turn off then on to get it to work.more than once.  Recently it wouldn’t connect at all. 6 months old. Connected my old speaker to test. No problem. Sound is decent if you can get them to sit in your ears correctly while doing an intensive workout. Also very finicky about charge cables.

Senso Headsets


I've tried several of these advertised headsets with Bluetooth. In th epast the devices worked well to begin with and then started falling apart. Not so with this manufactires headset.

Great range and battery life


Positives: Great range and battery life.  I charge them briefly before heading to the gym and they've yet to die on me after a month of use.Negatives: The part that wraps around the ear is not sturdy.  If the buds don't fit your ear, the wraps do little to help.  Also, the red button on the right earpiece is a small issue for me.  Pressing once pauses playback, pressing twice calls your previous call.  I've accidentally called people numerous times because of this feature.Overall, I'd recommend this product.

I have used these a few times now and I am very pleased. I had almost given up on finding an affordable set of wireless headphones that didn't skip out every few seconds with activity.  These sound great and I have not had a single skip over several miles of use.  My only complaint is that the part that fits over your ear is a bit bulky but it's not a deal breaker.

There is only two cons to these headphones. One is that they aren't super easy to put on. I never really had wrap around head phones like these so I'm sure I'll get better at putting them on. Secondly I found it weird that you can't really see the battery percentage but once your headphones are low on battery it makes an annoying beeping noise.But other than that I really am enjoying these headphones a lot! Sound quality is great and I can walk away from my phone a good distance before it starts cutting out.

Not willing to spend copious amounts of hard earned loot on earbuds like beats. Farming loot isn't RL. Cost effective is.


***Edit: 8/2/18 my headphones are kaput. I took great care of them, but as I took them off the charger one morning and went about my usual routine of putting them on and getting my day together then no longer turn on. I thought I may have or my wife or son flipped the switch that controlled that receptacle, but I quickly knew that wasn’t the case as my Apple Watch showed it was full-power. I opted for another microUSB that was charging my SkullCandy Barricade Bluetooth speaker. Pulled the cable from its wall adapter and plugged it into the watch docking station and saw that it was good, so was the cable that ran the normal Senso charge. I’m still unsure of it why they died, could be that a year and a half is all the time you get for use. However, being fair, it could be that I had used it on fast charge adapters; I hadn’t thought the inverted wouldn’t be able to handle it and that’s my fault for not verifying. I purchased another Senso set, but for my wife because for that price and the amount of daily/weekly use I placed on the headphones, $30 is beyond fair for their sound quality.I will give it some less than favorable shine for having it give static when my iPhone is on my hip in case and my earbuds were in. This happened intermittently towards the earbuds end of life. Whether outside, inside, away from or near hundreds of pedestrians walking in my path of travel it would occur. Again this was only towards the end of life.  Overall I’m still plenty satisfied with them. I purchased some TaoTronic over ears just to see the life cycle of another brand;>>>Original Review>>>I LOVE my Senso's. Took me forever to write a review but I was tying to test them out and then honestly forgot to review. Sorry Invotek! So I actually held off because I had the anomaly that delivered and malfunctioned. The multifunction button lodged in; never released. I contacted and they got me a return label and shipped out a new replacement. Quality is great and bass delivery for me is excellent. I listen to a lot of rock (chevelle, breaking benjamin, rise against, incubus, etc) and it's deep enough to where my playlists don't sound like a stock radio from the 90s, home to the almighty tweeter. My hip hop can fluctuate but thats due to tons of it being my cd rips and it not being uniform. I should clarify that fluctuate for me is perfect decibel of lows vs overbearing bass that drowns out the bars.The multifunction  of the volume to raise/lower volume and hold to next song I guess would be my only gripe. And that's only because I never remember it's hold for a second and release to next, I constantly and consistently press/release and curse my memory when the song doesn't skip and I get a volume increase when I don't want to listen to some ridiculous pandora pairing on my stations.I have never gotten to fully time my use until it died and needed a recharge, but I know it's well over 4 maybe 5 hours of use with a mixture of Bluetooth calls and music. I swear it seemed like a week of use without a charge a few times (not extreme use in those instances; walking to the office and parking structure, around at lunch and while I'm studying).Also I still haven't changed out the different ear buds so I'm still stoked that I have that ""newness"" to check and see what difference in sound delivery I get or if it's just to fit ear weird ear canals. :)The accessories are a big bonus for me. Thanks guys. I was right to give you a chance, because the quality and cost are great.PS, if you have to contact customer support it seems like it's back alley, but they were prompt, professional, courteous and seemingly genuine with wanting you to get the best/most from your purchase. Adam, thanks for your help and not sounding like a drone going through the motions. It was appreciated and noticed!

These come in handy for working out and listening to a device while walking around even other rooms. I clean the earpieces regularly, so I don't worry about moisture much any more.The volume adjustment is a little hard to deal with, but it works.No pairing issues.They don't hold really tight to the ears.

If on the fence about which BT headphones to get, you found the right ones!


People say you get what you pay for, but every now and then you get MUCH MUCH more!Music sounds AMAZING, the battery life lasts a really long time (all day and then some), and they sit very comfortably on my ears for a long time. (I meditate with them in my ears and forget they are on.)On top of he 5 star product, Senso's customer service went absolutely above and beyond when suddenly my left earphone started to cut out on me. After an email with a short set of instructions to diagnose the problem correctly, they completely verified my address and promptly sent me a replacement pair. They have a 1 year warranty!I am a very satisfied customer!

The battery is rated as up to 8 hours play time and I am testing that out but so far so good. The quality of the product is good


I've had the headphones for a week now and only have had to do the initial charge and haven't recharge since.  In that time I've had 3 workouts each about 1 hour.  The battery is rated as up to 8 hours play time and I am testing that out but so far so good.The quality of the product is good, they even sent out a car charger which is nice.  Happy with the purchase thus far and think the price is right.I also purchased the 2 year warranty as my prior headphones (very similar) but had Bluephonic logo instead of the Senso logo died after 8 months.And as these are very similar the 2 year warranty at $4.99 seems like a good idea.

SENSO Bluetooth Headphones - great product


This is my first Bluetooth headset.  They are easy to pair with Droid Turbo 2.  The music sound is great quality.  I had a problem getting the phone audio to work, but after rebooting phone it works great. They are very light, and feel comfortable on the ears, even with reading glasses on.  The accessories are great, especially for car charging.  The case is great quality.  There is no wall plug for charging, so have to use a device with USB port.  My laptop charged them within 30 minutes. I haven't had a chance to evaluate the sound during a long run in wet and windy conditions, yet.  Overall, I am very happy with the (indoor) sound quality and value for money.

These are just ok. I have a pair of powerbeats3 and the fidelity on the SENSO are sub-par in comparison.  The bass and high treble are muffled.

Recommend for young adults or college grads on a budget and are not looking for high fidelity or quality.

A great option for quality at a low price!


The sound and volume are great for the price. These are the best headphones at this price point (~$35) I've ever heard. If I had to say one criticism, however, it's that they are not really ""noise cancelling"" as the title claims. There are special foam ear buds included with them that reduce external noise, but it is not comparable to the true ""noise cancelling"" effect you find with top of the line headphones. All in all, this is a great deal regardless!

Read full review. There still a good choice


I give 3 stars because...1. They stated that it came with a 3' charge cable, and a dual car charger. It didnt.2. The charger port cover is loose, if you brush on it lightly it will open. So it's not that water proof.And 3. It has a 15 second delay( the sound is distorted) when linking up to Bluetooth. NOW THE GOOD..the sound quality is awesome. good, clean, deep bass, and good mid tones, tones down the hi's.  It still clear. I love the sound of these headphones. They stay in your ears. Weight balance is good. Charge time is good. Play time/stand by time lasts two work days(as a painter). I'd say buy these if you like good bass, cause they thump!

Absolute steal. The best value earphones on the market today


I read all the reviews of this product, hopeful yet sceptical I ordered the earphones as the price was not to be ignored. These are FANTASTIC quality for an amazing price, I cycle a lot, the problem I have with wireless is that with the wind noise of cycling, they don't have enough punch,you can hardly hear the music even at full volume. The Senso earphones however, are really loud! At full volume they are way TOO loud, which allows me to tailor my volume depending on the conditions of the day. Sound quality is rich, more bass than I would like but not muddy( downloaded an EQ app to correct this), they fit the ears well and go for hours on a 30 min charge. The added extras in the box make this product an absolute no brainer. Telephony is ok but not fantastic,but I didn't buy them to make phone calls, but still a very handy feature.

I have bought two sets of these earphones. One as a backup. The overall sound is good but, you must have a tight fit to get  decent sound quality. Especially for the bass. One good thing is that they include a set of foam tips to get a tight fit. I like the hooks which help to keep the earphones in place.

If you are a woman or someone who has relatively smaller ear structures, you should reconsider purchasing this item.


so I decided to purchase this item because I watched a youtuber recommend it. However, the thing he failed to mention was that if you were a woman or someone who had relatively small ears buying this item, the rubber part that was supposed to hook on your ears would NOT fit your ears. This is quite annoying especially if you have long hair like me. The headphones will get caught up in your hair constantly because it will not properly hooked on your ear. With that being said, everything else including the sound and battery life etc are good as advertised. I highly recommend this item as a gift to men or people who have relatively larger ear structure.

Very good product


These buds are the most comfortable of any type I have used. The inserts are made of a soft pliable neoprene that blocks out other sounds unlike other foam material I have used & they stay in place. The hard buds used by other brands tend to cause discomfort for me after some use and tend to fall out when doing and active workout. The sound is excellent and I would say exceed the sound quality of the pair I purchased for my wife that were much more expensive and a very popular brand. I haven't had them long enough to know how long the charge will last when they are 6 months old but I am very happy with them at this point. My Ratings: Comfort Rating -10, Sound -10, Ease of Use - 10, Value for Cost - 10, Overall satisfaction - 10, Recommend to Friends - 10. I want to update here on my experience. I have owned these for 22 months and they have worked well up until about 30 days ago and the charge wouldn't last more than a 45 min workout and the next day I had to recharge. Now they wont charge at all but that is nearly 2 years so I am happy with the life of them but like anyone was wishing for more or possibly the option to replace the battery. I purchased another set as I really like them.

Terribly Muted Sound Quality


The sound is awful. These are possibly the most muted-sounding earbuds I've ever tried, and that's saying something. Between whatever they do electronically and the molded earbuds themselves (think ear plugs), they do a decent job at noise cancelling. But if you don't have it cranked real loud, the sound quality is so poor your experience will not be good.

Not that great of a product. Intermittent quality issues all the time. I normally connect these to my phone which I carry in the breast pocket of my coat (about a foot away from the headphones), when walking in the city get nothing but static sometimes. Poor connection. Also not noise cancelling in the least bit. Will be returning these and would not recommend.

Excessive Wind Noise


I bought these headphones hoping to get a cheap set of Bluetooth ear buds that I didn't mind getting sweaty during workouts. Unfortunately, as soon as you start running all you can hear is wind noise from the headphones. Turning the volume up excessively loud drowns out the wind noise but it is still audible and now you are listening to music very loudly thus it is hard to hear your surroundings. I was hoping that it was just overly windy during my first few runs with the headphones but that simply isn't the case, the noise has persisted. Will be getting something else to replace them.

I did a ton of research before settling on the Senso earphones, and chose them for the great reviews. The quality is superior all around from packaging to sound quality. Definitely would recommend them to anyone in the market that has been considering spending good money on high end ear buds. Look no further and buy these ASAP. You're getting top quality at a very affordable price.

So far so good 😉 (They have held up for over a month great despite my very sweaty workouts)


Today (05/21/2017) is my first day with these headphones. Using them around the house while doing chores and listening to a wide variety of Music everything from Americana to Hip Hop sounded great. I'm a bit of an audiophile and for the price you can't beat the bass response and clarity. I plan on mostly using these at the gym where I usually sweat buckets that ruined my older version of some BackBeats that weren't designed for the abuse I put them through. These sounds much better and the ear bud fits my ear really well. I'll update this review after I've been working out for a while.UPDATE: (06/25/2017) I have now had these through over 20 high intensity workouts where I sweated enough to where there was no dry spots left on my shirts. The amount of sweat I've put out would have damaged most other headsets I've bought in the past. Also, I have these in my ear for anywhere from 30% to 60% of my waking days. I use these for conference calls while at work. I've only had 2 issues so far. First is that the cable running between them phones can lay on my neck in such a way that makes it hard to turn my head, but this is my own fault and nothing could be done about this other than if the cable was removed.  The second issue I've run into has to do with my Samsung Gear Fit 2. When I'm wearing my Fit2 on my left wrist like I normally do while listening to music off of it, on the back swing of my stride, the Bluetooth has issues due to the receiver being on the right side. I've fixed this by just wearing the Fit2 on my right wrist when I go walking or jogging without my phone.  I still love these and would HIGHLY recommend them based on their price. I don't know if any manufactures could do much better and if these break, I'll be buying more. Fortunately,

First off the price was a little deceiving since it could keep some buyers from thinking the quality might not be there, but these are high quality headphones with a low budget price.  You can't ask for a better combination.  Would recommend to all audiophiles.  Itook a chance and was surprisingly rewarded."" Shipping and packaging were excellent. Quality headphones with very good noise cancellation. Can't beat the price. ""

Update:  these quit working after about six months.  I was looking for a basic set of headphones that would stay in my ears when running and stay connected to my phone.  These do both great.  The sound quality is fine for a basic listener.  I do find that I have to recharge them quite often.

(Updated review) Very much value for money. Bought another one!


I had 2 stars for this initially. I am updating my review.I had some issues with the left earbud being louder than the right one. I got some reset instructions from the vendor and the problem seems to have gone away. I think this is an anomaly and not the norm. If just in case, you run into this problem, please get in touch with the vendor within 30 days.This does not have Bose sound quality but surely at its price point this headphone is very much value for money. It is robust for all your gym visits and daily work use. It has decent battery life. Their packaging is also very thoughtful of the customer with a bunch of extra accessories. I bought another one for my dad. He enjoys it too. Both blue and red colors look good.

So I love the fact that they are wireless, they fit well, and are a good value for the price, the bass appears to distort on certain songs at a low volume, but then works better at a higher volume, they are great for working out, or just relaxing, for the price I am very pleased with the product.

Not worth the hassle


You get what you pay for. Had it for less than a month and the volume up/down buttons have stopped working. Had no connectivity issues otherwise but physically the headphones are very flimsy and the ear-clips are some of the most uncomfortable I have ever used. Be advised the seller also likes to send review reminders (received twice thus far in less than a month). Would have kept the headphones had it not been for the volume button not working but glad it spazzed out now than a few months down the line.

READ THIS FIRST!


The cord is AGGRAVATING! When wear it in the front it gets in the way when you are looking or bending down and when worn behind the neck frequently when you turn your head to either side it pulls the ear bud out of your ear on the opposite side you are looking, especially when sweating. Too bad, the Bluetooth features are great but the constant battle to keep the buds in your ear negates that.

Sound Quality and Sound Consistency Horrible


I usually use these headphones at the gym and while running, like majority of my headphones, and these headphones work horribly in both of those environments. I've had mine now for over a year and it is just not consistent in performance. Majority of the time whenever I bend, squat, or just sit while my phone is in my pocket the music drops out. And I can't walk more than 5ft away from my phone without the bluetooth losing reception. I would not buy this product again, and I would recommend you not to. The only good thing I can say about this product is that it came with extra ear buds.

Bass level is way too high


I didn't expect much for the price, but these are not good headphones. The bass is cranked up beyond what is reasonable. The fit leaves a lot to be desired as I can't even get the buds all the way seated in my ears, which makes the noise cancellation worthless. The power/play button is situated in such a way that when you are trying to insert the earbud you either have to press it or awkwardly grip it as to not push the button. I would not buy these again.

I enjoy using the earbuds, but there are a couple minor issues I do have with them.  It would be nice if the volume control could have more adjustments between settings- also a longer warning time that the battery is about to die... Mine completely died after 4 months of use.

The headphones work great. The sound is clear and vibrant


The headphones work great . The sound is clear and vibrant.  I was very surprised by the quality of the sound . I thought because the product is relatively inexpensive that I would not have the range of sound that you get from these headphones. My only complaint is that the microphone is not the best. I was told that my voice sounded like a speaker phone from across the room. I use the headphones for going to the gym or going on walks. If the headphones had a microphone on the wire it would be much stronger. I am going to look into that to see if send so makes this type of product. I highly recommend these headphones because the quality of the sound is excellent and the price is just as good

For the price it's good, but it's not premium quality


I bought these thinking they could be a substitute for something like the jaybirds or other relatively expensive wireless earbuds. Premium, flawless, great build is what I was looking for. Turns out, you get what you pay for. For the price, I imagine this product is top tier, but there are little quirks here and there that remind you this was $40. The wrap around plastic part that goes on your ear can feel flimsy, aka, you can't go running with this thing on, or walk around or jerk your head around without feeling like it's coming loose. Another issue I've noticed is while theyre on, you can hear a buzzing noise through the earpiece, and it is definitely noticable unless you turn what you're listening to up loud enough to drown out the sound. Not saying this is a bad product, it's an amazing product, but it's not a substitute for higher end wireless earbuds.

Utterly fantastic headphones


Update January 2019:Recently, I accidentally put my SENSO headphones through a full cycle in the washing machine and the dryer. I was sure that they would be dead once I discovered them, but to my astonishment, they not only worked but I have been unable to detect any decrease in performance or quality. It's been over a month since the washing machine incident and they are still performing as well as ever. These headphones are truly incredible; this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I'd give them six stars if I could!Original review (2017):Fantastic headphones for the the price. I'm training for a marathon and these headphones have powered me through many, many miles of training runs. Sound quality is good, fit is customizable with multiple sizes of ear buds, and battery life is long. Highly recommended.

I've been using these at work since I received them, and they have been working great for me! They connected to my Galaxy S8+ on the first attempt and  I've had no issues with disconnects or interference, which could be a problem at my job, considering I would in the tech industry. The only issue I have is that the left earpiece is a little bit rough where the plastic was molded, but I think this will probably wear to smooth from use. That is the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.

Not the greatest for running


I bought these to replace the  JBL Headset I thought I had lost. 
JBL Reflect Mini Bluetooth In-Ear Sport Headphones, Black
. I like the SENSO ones, and they are quite good value, but they are a bit big and heavy, and the hook over the ear is soft and thus does not actually hold the earbuds in place. So as you are running they tend to fall out. As a result I cannot really use for exercising as I though I might.But the headset is fine otherwise,  good sound and good battery life. Just not the best for its advertised use case.Luckily I found my JBL, and I use that for excercise, the SENSO for commuting.

They're fine


I've had these headphones for about a week and a half now, and have used them pretty much every day. My first impressions were great. The packaging and accessories are nice (USB car adapter is quite handy), they look great, paired easily on every device I tried, and they certainly feel solidly made. Sound quality was another issue.The clarity on these are nice, and they are plenty loud, but they just sound muted. Not distorted or muffled; just......off. The bass is ok, the highs are pretty nice, but the mids feel less present than they should be to me. I guess a good way to put it is that the mids lack pop. They're clear enough, but are somewhat lower in tone than you may be used to. I've tried them on my phone, my tablet, Echo Dot, and computer. Each gave the same results.Voice calls seemed ok, but I haven't really used them in noisy or windy environments, so YMMV.They do come with quite a range of rubber pieces to fit your ears, so for most people fit will probably not be an issue, and they are comfortable. I just found that over a 30 minute span on the treadmill I have to reach up and adjust them in my ear a couple of times because they tend to shift on me. Maybe it's the really soft material used for the part that goes over the ear, or maybe it is just my ears, I dunno.Range is ok for my use. I guess I got around 40ft between rooms. I'd suspect you could get a bit farther outdoors. I mostly have the device I am listening to close by, so that works fine for me.I will say this though, customer service seems great. I was confused by one of the cables they sent. I assumed it was the wrong one, so shot a message to customer service. I had a reply within a couple of hours telling me that the cable is multi use, and explaining how to disconnect the iPhone plug from the micro USB to use it for charging the headphones. Kudos on that.All in all, they are ok for the price. It's not something that inspires brand loyalty to the point where I can say definitively that my next pair will be these, but they work well enough (assuming the fit issue doesn't worsen). I don't regret the purchase (I still use them daily), but if I should lose these tomorrow, I may want to try a different set. Not because they're bad. They're just not quite the pair that would be the end of the headphone journey for me.

Headphones are just ok.  I probably wouldn't buy them again. Curved piece that goes over the ear is flimsey and does not stay on if you have smaller ears. The piece that goes into your ear is fairly large and bulky.  Sound quality is moderate at best. I would have been better to pay more money and purchased the Beats. One aspect I do like is only having a thin cord around my neck.

I was pretty impressed with the price and easy wearability as well. Three weeks ago the left ear stopped producing sound. I tried to do my own trouble shooting and still no success. Yesterday my right ear stopped working, would not turn on or connect at all. I am extremely disappointed and it is such a waste.

I am not an expert on earbuds, but I have tried quite a few.  None seem to stay in my ears when I run.  These do.

Two ports, one higher amps...sorry I forget the two as I do not have it on front of me. Nice bonus for sure. Also a charging cable for the ear buds.

Not up to Par.


The blue tooth seems weak. Walk in the other room and it may drop. I'm also not that impressed with the sound either. I thought for sure that they would be much cleaner. The bass seems somewhat muddy and the highs just don't have it! The one thing that does work well is the Mic. I would spend the little extra money on Bose or Beats if the need arises!!

Specialized review -- but still pleased


I bike to work, so my needs are a bit atypical. The chassis is a bit large, and took a few moments to finagle with my helmet's chin strap. The ""do everything"" button gets pressed often by accident, but I'm learning to adapt to that.  Changing to a medium earbud helped reduce wind whistle in my ear, and the sound quality is better than I expected.Interesting side note: My cycling jersey has three pockets on the rear, and if my cell is in the middle pocket, the bluetooth signal is cut off.  But if I move it to the right pocket, it's clear as a bell and no blankouts.  Another easy adaptation on my part.This is a good product, and you will appreciate their value.  I'm a hard reviewer, by the way.

Great value, great sound


I am not an expert but I have bought many earphones and these are one of the best. The value is great, they fit well and offer a full range of sounds. For earbuds it has great bass but it can overpower the treble. However, if you want a good sounding earbuds that won't fall out running or lifting weights these are the ones to get without shelling out $300. You'll like them.

Sounds like a record skipping


Bluetooth connection loses packets between iPhone6s and headphones.  Sounds like a record skipping, for those of us old enough to remember such a thing.  Phone is in pouch at waist, so headphones are less than 3 feet from transmitter.  Use is outside while walking or running.  Music skips 2-5 times per song.  I like everything else about these headphones, unfortunately they fail at their primary purpose.

Comfort is great, sound quality not so much


Positives: Comfort-wise, they are a 5 star. They fit the ear canal well. The wire connecting the buds is the perfect length so it doesn't flop around or get in the way during your workout.Sound quality is the reason for my 2 star rating. When I'm working out, I like to have the volume at the highest level. At mid level, on most songs, the sound quality becomes poor and the music sounds staticky.

Solid for the price but not durable


I used these head phones a lot to work out. They are good, and they stay in your ear very good but they are not durable at all. The first pair I ordered stopped working in less than a year, but I was able to get a new pair under warranty. The most recent pair now only works in the right ear. The left ear stopped working. For the price, they are not bad...but don't expect them to last more than a year before needing to be replaced.

Meh


They’re too large for my ears, and cause pain when I have them in for more than 30 minutes. If I reposition them, they just fly out of my ear. I bought them in April 2017 and they stopped working now, the sound cuts in and out, and only out of one ear. They’re okay, but I’d be willing to spend a little more for better quality.

SENSO Bluetooth Headphones - Great value at a great prices


I couldn't be happier with this purchase. The product works exactly as advertised. The minimalist look and feel is augmented by a powerful set of speakers that features a sterling sound. Set up is quick and easy, and the accessories alone are worth the price of admission.If you're looking for a GREAT set of wireless Bluetooth headphones, buy SENSO.

I LOVE these headphones!!!!


This is the 4th pair of blue tooth headphones I've bought through amazon and they are by far my favorite!! They turn on in the shortest amount of time, the buttons are nice quality and easy to use and find. The multi device blue tooth pairing works the best of any headphones I've bought to date - coming online and connecting immediately to my phone and my iPad Pro one after the other and accepting a sound stream from either device without issue or complaint.  It was a pleasant surprise getting a car charger and multi cable that works both with the headphones and my apple devices!

Average Ear Buds, Average Company.


Pro's; relatively inexpensive, packaged well, quick and easy to charge, easy to sync with my I phone, sound is just fine for my podcast needs.  Shipped with plenty of chords and adapters.Con's:  Doesn't stay in my ear securely, always popping out.  There are 3 different sized ear channel guides, none of which helped.  If I wear a winter hat it keeps the buds in, but don't know what I will do in the warmer weather.  The company was slow to fill my order and ship.  I ordered on a Sunday and with Amazon Prime was expecting them on Tuesday or Wednesday - they showed up Friday afternoon.The buds would be fine if they stayed securely in my ear.  They don't and I'm struggling with these ear buds.  Based upon the company's inability to ship in a timely manner, I am unwilling to spend the time investigating its customer service.  Will keep these and try to find another pair of ear buds.

Bluetooth range is so poor that when my cell phone is in my pocket, they cut out about once a minute.  Factory suggested resetting the headphones to fix the problem. That did not help at all.

Review after more than 1 year of use.Sound quality is decent. Works while running/skipping, though seems to skip/disconnect for few milliseconds/seconds while doing any such activity.Took good care of these headphones, lasted for about an year, now left earphone is not working, looks like some loose connection as it would work only when the cable between right and left ear is held in a particular position.So if looking for a headphone to last more than an year probably these are not the ones else good for about a year.

This is the second pair of these headphones I’ve bought. The first pair worked beautifully.  I had no problems with them. I only brought this pair because I thought I had lost the first. Unfortunately these headphones are constantly losing connection with my phone, even though my phone is 3 feet way. If move my head the wrong way they lose connection and power off. Since I use these for working out, this happens constantly.  I found my old pair, so these are going in the trash. I should have returned them when I had the chance.

Comfortable and light, but noisy in the wind.


The earphones are light and comfortable.  The playback is bass heavy, but that's how I like my music.  The only problem I had with these was when I was running in the wind.  The earphones seemed to pick up a lot of wind noise to a point where it was so loud, I couldn't hear the music playback.  The wind wasn't that strong, but the earphones amplified the wind noise enough to overpower the music.  If I ran indoors, or in a place where there was no wind, then these earphones would work great.

The sound quality is very good on these especially depending on how far you get them into the ear. The microphone on these is absolutely terrible and does not work at all.

Comfortable, Secure, and Solid


I purchased these headphones as a pair I can take exercising/on-the-go and not worry about wasting tons of money if they broke. I am very pleasantly surprised at the quality of headphones I received. They hold charge super well, stay in my ears incredibly well, and have a surprisingly good audio quality. Sure, they're not going to give you the same experience as an over-the-ear studio quality headphone, but they hold there own against name brand wireless earbuds. The only con is the pause/main button causes you to push the bud deeper in your ear, which can get uncomfortable. But all-in-all I definitely don't regret buying these and would recommend them to anyone looking for affordable and comfortable wireless headphones.

They will charge and will say connected and will IMMEDIATELY disconnect.  I have tried to reconnect several times over the weekend to no avail.

Adjust insertion depth for your needs


Initually I didn't like these for running. It makes a perfect seal and I could hear myself hitting the pavement and breathing. But full insertion to make a ""cork"" seal should be performed only when you're sitting or resting. It's fine to let the hooks do the work and merely let the buds rest against your ears! I ran last night with them not making a perfect seal and the sound was fine, still had highs and lows.

The sound on these are great but they just do not fit.....no matter what I've tried.

Thus said these fall out within seconds of putting them on, I can't imagine trying to workout with these in.

Had a slight connection issue after using for one week. I contacted the company by email and they responded immediately and gave me a suggestion which worked. Great customer service.

Probably the best wireless Earbuds sold.


Used the Bluetooth Earbuds for the first time on my 4.0 Mile run. Previously using the iphone provided wired Earbuds. I thought the SENSO Earbuds were great. The instructions were very easy to follow and the Earbuds function as advertised.  I did not have to continuously readjust the position of the Earbuds due to sweat, jarring out of position or catching the wire with my hands. The SENSO Earbuds eliminated all of those issues. I simply placed the SENSO Earbuds, turned them on and took off. I didn't have to mess with them until I completed my run. They are hardly even noticeable on the ear.  And the music plays flawlessly with great sound. So far a great product.

Impossible to connect to your phone


I bought these as a gift for someone and tested them out when they arrived without any issue on my phone. The sound quality was decent, the depth of the bass was above average I’d say, the treble and middle tons were kind of hollow sounding, not as rich as nicer options but still I was happy with them. The construction seemed okay, the ear loop seemed somewhat flimsy.The biggest issue is THEY NEVER CONNECTED TO ANY PHONE AGAIN. Never detectable on Bluetooth. Read the manual online at least 10 times, followed every step repeatedly. Did the factory reset, turned phones on and off and not one time was the headset detectable. Completely frustrating and embarrassing as a gift.

If you ride a bike or run fast or even walk on a windy day. You will hate these headphones. The wind noise hitting the large headphone body make them pretty unusable.

I feel comfortable knowing if anything goes wrong with the earbuds within a year I'm covered.What more could I ask for.

The customer service is also great. I would buy from again


I am giving this 5 stars for multiple reasons. First off - I do not want to spend $150+ for wireless earbuds. For this price, I honestly think it's worth giving a shot. It doesn't fall out while I work out which is the main reason I bought it. You also get different sizes of the buds so that helped a lot. The customer service is also great. I would buy from again.

They don’t work - UPDATED-


Update - 1/8/19I am updating my review because Senso saw my review and they immediately contacted me.  We tried to see if we had to reset the headphones and realized they were defected.  They sent me a replacement pair ASAP.Thank you Senso team for caring so much about your customers and the quick turnaround.I’ve only had these headphones for two months and they turn off by themselves. It’s so annoying when I’m working out and they turn off and I turn them back on and they turn off again.  This happens at least every minute

Good earbuds


Good earbuds, does the job well, however, I do wish these had magnetic ends so it is easier to wear these around the neck. If I were to buy earbuds again, that would be a strong feature I would like to have. Other than that, these earbuds have been well. It is grease- resistance so the ear grease isn't easily visible, but I also keep my ears clean.The one thing you'll probably want to do (after you decide you're gonna keep it) is rip off the flap that covers the charging port. For me, that was just annoyingThe charge time is okay. I didn't time it, but it's not fast or slow, in the middle I would say. For the nerds, my USB amp meter says the earbuds take in about .1A while charging, but remember the battery is also very smallBattery life is okay, but I usually have the opportunity to charge it before it's low.The earbuds do stay secure in my ear. I don't have to fuss them around to fit back in if I am going for a walk or lifting at the gym.The bass offering this gives out is fairly good. My girlfriend has the ANKER SoundBuds slim and the bass on the SENSO is superior to the ANKERThe included pouch is okay. I feel like it could have been slightly more spacious because I do struggle fitting my earbuds in there with having the strand poke through, but it's not difficult; just a little annoying. The pouch itself is sturdy, not terribly weak or flimsy.Overall, good earbuds. Has lots of features that I don't make use of day-to-day, but I don't find myself complaining about the lack of features as well.

Great at first but didn’t last long.


I bought these for running. They stay in we’ll and fit people with small ears. However, if it’s super windy, it impacts the sound quality considerably. Also, I only used them about 15-20 times and one ear bud stopped working. Disappointed in the overall quality.

Received on time. Packaging was as promised. I needed something to use for exercise and in my car (no hands free in the car). So far the car issue is solved, haven't tried the exercise yet. I'm a little confused as to why there is a longer Apple charging cord in with a very short android charging cord. Come to think of it, not sure why the Apple cord is in the package at all? I'm not an Apple owner so forgive the confusion.

Wind noise a small but pertinent issue.


Good sound quality, holds a charge well & comfortable to wear. I haven't used them for more than 4 hours at a time, so I can't vouch for run time length, but they will hold a charge for at least 10 days. My only issue is the wind noise at some angles. Other reviewers have mentioned it and I agree, it can be overwhelming some times. Otherwise, no complaints.

Not bad. Not Perfect


They do not work with my windows 10 computer very well. This is the only real complaint I have. I can pair them, but the play / pause feature doesn't work at all. I can skip the song with them though, which is nice.They work perfectly with my phone.I have small ears, and they are slightly uncomfortable, so I'm trying different tips and experimenting.The case is small and it is hard to fit the ear buds in it. No real space for the charging cable. It is well made and has a sleek design though.Sometimes the over ear hook doesn't fit properly at all, and they do fall out if not positioned just right. These are slightly noise cancelling, but if the wind picks up, it creates a whistling effect.Fantastic charge time. They last me the majority of the day. The notification voice is sometimes a bit muted, thus making it easy to miss but it's not unpleasant to hear.These are a good pair of headphones for the person who isn't too concerned about audio quality and wants to experiment with Bluetooth audio.I probably won't buy them again, but I'm not upset either.Update.They have broke after about five months. The left side of the earbuds quit working. The company has replaced them, however the new pair has a large white scratch on the side and the included car chargers front has been dented inwards in multiple places. The product also came complete with horrible audio coming from both side. Pa*asoni*s ear buds last much longer, cost much less, and come in a wider variety of color options. Paying more doesn't mean your going to get quality.

Solid performance, huge value


Excellent headphones, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they sometimes seem to have a connection disturbance and I'll get spotty sound.  I'm still trying to pinpoint the exact issue, but I haven't been able to as of now.  I do a lot of trail running and love these so much that I bought a pair for my wife, and she loves them too.

Fair for the price. It connected easily, charged quickly, and has decent sound (I'm not a sound expert). It doesn't stay on my ears as well as expected, and falls off more on the right side - is that my ear, or the product? Annoying either way. Still, wireless ear buds for under $30, with zero technical issues, is a win.

The charger was broken after few weeks, sound started become lower and lower, now I am suffering and I can barely use it because of its sound quality, it's buds are easily taken of whenever you put it in your pocket or even if you keep it around your neck so I had to look for it three or four times a day. The customer service is horrible, when I complained about sound quality they sent me a message on how to reset the headphone, I tried resetting it and nothing changed, they stopped to response to me hoping after few days I will be passing one year of purchase date.

These ear buds are soooo comfortable and snug, I can't believe it! For years, I have been unable to find a headphone that would stay in my ear while working out or laying in bed. They would either fall out or be painful. I had my fiance try them on and next you know, he had me buy a pair for him too lol. The sound quality is great and they are so easy to pair to your devices.

First let me say I am roughly 80% deaf so I was worried that these would not be loud enough for me to use ... I was wrong.


First let me say I am roughly 80% deaf so I was worried that these would not be loud enough for me to use ... I was wrong.  They are extremely loud and work great for me.  They are as loud as my over ear headphones with 2 amplifiers running on them without any added amplification.  Most in ear earbuds are extremely uncomfortable for me after extended use but the changeable buds that come with these are extremely comfortable and I can wear for hours without any discomfort.I purchased these and a bluetooth transmitter to be able to enjoy watching tv with my family on family movie night without maxing out the volume and making everyone else uncomfortable.  I have yet to run the battery dead and have used them for as long as 6 hours straight.  I am able to walk through the house and still get a good signal for the most part however sometimes it has trouble when I am in the farthest room roughly 30ft away through multiple walls so pretty good range and reception.The only con I have found is that sometimes I have to unpair them from my phone to get them to pair with the bluetooth transmitter but not really difficult to do so I didn't take a star for that.

These fit well; I’ve got smaller ears so having headphones fit is always a bit scary. With a bit of bending, these guys fit great. The sound quality is perfect. My only advice is to adhere to the half-full (or half-empty depending your life view) battery symbol.

Arrived prompt, in tact, packaged well, as described, & great quality. I appreciated the email from the company inquiring about my experience so they can ensure the consumers are receiving a quality product.For me, the loop is a little large and since it can't be adjusted I find myself twisting & turning the bud in an awkward position to find a better fit. Other than that & the fact I have only had them for about 2 weeks I gave it 4 stars. I cannot speak to how well they last over time yet but I'm hopeful they will & that if there are any problems customer service will address them.I hope your business thrives & you continue to produce a quality product, for a good cost because people will support you.

It is a good product for having only used it for a week


It is a good product for having only used it for a week. I like that there is a voice that tells you if it has paired with your device or not. Also, there are multiple silicone earpiece covers that you can use to try and find the best fit for your ears. However, unfortunately after trying all of the different sizes I was unable to use a size that was suitable for my workouts. I will say though that my workouts are intense in the sense that I do a lot of jumping, running and head movement. Thus, these keep falling out and I can't have headphones that require I tend to them often.Overall, if you work out hard to intense I would suggest finding some headphones that will sit in/on your ear a little bit better.

You have to buy it to try it


I have to admit this is one of my fewest reviews I've posted on Amazon. Last week I had my JayBirdx2 earbuds go through a laundry cycle, so you kind of guess what happened next. I was in the search for a new Bluetooth headphones and Senso came up, and I really didn't want to spend over $100 for another JayB. When I saw the over 5K reviews I told myself is worth trying. Can't go wrong for that price. They are light, easy to put them on, and I like the over the ear support. I have used them only ones, but going to the gym later and planning to use them again. I'm not satisfied with sound though, coming from the Jaybird headphones. Othere than that aspect no complains yet.

Pleasantly surprised


We have tried several bluetooth headphones; first started with Jaybirds for $170 that lasted about  2 weeks because they kept falling out during cardio. Tried a few others and found a pair that I liked until the ear piece broke, so I borrowed a pair of wireless Beats from a friend that didn't like the way they fit until I found another pair. I bought these and compared them to the beats disconnecting and pairing on the same songs to see which are better. I don't know if he bought knockoffs or what but they weren't even close. I had the tv on with a Samsung soundbar volume was louder than you would watch tv. I turned the headphones on maybe half volume and I couldn't hear the TV. Needless to say my fiancee stole them for her contest prep, and I am once again without a good pair of headphones until i order another pair

I liked these. I run in the heat and they were light and stayed mostly in place. Cord behind the neck always settled and pulled to one side but I used to be in wearables and I know how hard it is to get electronics to be elements proof and wear the way they're supposed to. Then the headphones died on me after ~6 months of use (probably used them 3-4 hours per week). I've tried everything possible- I get flashing lights and an error message. Unsatisfactory, my airpods take more of a beating, have been in use longer, and are still going strong.

It's obvious why there's almost 20,000 reviews for this great product. It works as advertised, great sound, easy to pair and for a price that you can't beat.

Great product and surprisingly great customer service


I needed some headphones for gym workouts that wouldn't fall out of my ears and have me tethered to my phone.  So I tried these out and was very impressed.  The sound quality is really good but best of all, the user interface is well designed so it works without much effort in setup or learning.  Also the battery life is pretty amazing.  But I did have a problem - one of the earpieces became disconnected and so one side stopped working.  I sent an email to the vendor, Invotek, on a Sunday not expecting a reply until Monday.  But there was a reply very quickly.  Explaining that there is a one year warranty, they asked me to take a photo of the problem and then sent me a complete product replacement in a few days.  They handled the problem very well.

Excellent product all around!!!


Here is the final test for me. These earbuds are amazing, outstanding and exceeded my expectations. I had bought a pricey brand and they were awful!!! I went online, researched and found these to have excellent reviews. Well they are all true. No pain in ears with buds, fits great and the sound is unbelievable. I am hearing impaired so it isn't easy to find this item where I can hear adequately. I have always used Apple but didn't want to spend $150 on their wireless buds. I didn't have to and I will be ordering another pair for my husband. Thanks so much for making a reasonably priced product to assist my less than adequate ears to hear my music perfectly. Way to go!!!  I recently bought a second pair for a gift. My daughter also likes them so a 3rd pair will be ordered soon. Thanks again!!!

Amazing company and amazing product


Amazing company and amazing product. These headphones work great and the battery life is so good compared to similar style headphones of different brands but the most amazing part is definitely the customer service. After 5 months my headphones broke during an intensive cardio workout. I did not originally register my warranty bit did so once my headphones broke months later and they offered to send me a new pair no questions asked expect they just wanted a picture of the broken ones. That was easy enough and in 3 days I had my brand new pair. This is a great company that's stands behind there warranties.

Good headphones for the $


I bought these for running after spending a lot of money on powerbeats2 wireless headphones and having them break repeatedly. These paired easily, have good sound and the charge seems to last a while. My only complaint is how flimsy the plastic pieces are that go over the ears. UPDATE: I've been using these for a month, I've run a few hundred miles with them, including the Chicago Marathon, run miles in the rain, and these have held up well.  The battery seems to last 6-8 hours as advertised.  Great value for the money!

Amazing headphones!!


Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Had them for about 2 weeks and so far no problems whatsoever. Really good sound, especially for the price. I was nervous they would be tinny since they are inexpensive, but they sound pretty dang good. They’re obviously GREAT for the gym!!! The extras it came with are also wonderful!! Thank you!Update: 6 months later and still in love! The battery life is incredible.

For the price, beyond exceptional


These definitely aren't anywhere near the best sounding headphones but for under $20 I can't imagine there is any better in this price range. With memory foam tips the fit is fine. The headphones usually have initial difficulty connecting but always eventually connects. The sound is boomy. But for the price they're more than well worth it.

Best earbuds I ever had!


I absolutely love these earbuds!!! I only encountered one problem while I was at the gym. If I was using the weight machines there was not a problem but as soon as I started the treadmill, I had no music. This could very well be a problem with the service provider. Other than that I am totally happy with the product and delivery! Would not hesitate recommending it to anyone. Thank you!

Great bang for your buck


I bought these when I was training for my half marathon.  They stayed in my ear pretty well for the most part (excess sweat made them wiggle a little but that’s normal). Had them over a year now and have run hundreds of miles with them.  Still going strong.  Sound quality is average, no complaints.

I like it


I have used these for 2 days.. So far I am very happy.. I am not the person that needs perfect sound as I can't hear well anyway.. The volume and bass seem very good.. Hi notes perhaps a little harsh at really high volume.. Though I am using it with my Samsung gear fit 2 and I can't adjust anything but volume with it..They fit me well and I am very happy with it. Especially at the price. I have paid 3 times more for regular headphones that were not as good.

I use these with my MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 Plus. They are pretty darn loud, even with the lowest volume setting. But the noise cancelling works amazingly. The sound quality is fantastic with smooth vocals and rich bass.

Skips all the time


Have had for about a year and use about 2 hours a week.Audio quality is really good, until anything gets between the right earpiece (the receiver) and skips the signal like an early 2000s CD player. If you completely cup the headphone with your hand it completely cuts signal til you remove your hand. I carry my phone in my left pocket typically, but when I wear these headphones I have to put it in my right pocket so that my body doesn't interfere with the signal.From using 2 hours a week for a year I have only had to charge 4 times, great battery life.

Reviews from Gym Rats.


Bought two of these.One for my guy, his review: Awesome. Works great even when working out. Loves that they came with accessories for charging in the car.  The cord could be a bit shorter or longer that connects them. His shirt seems to catch it and it tugs on the ear pieces. Otherwise, no complaints.One for my morning babysitter, his review: Perfect. Sound great. Loves them. Perfect for working out.

Five Stars


Awesome sounds quality. Great quick function buttons on headset. Overall definitely worth the money. Great product thank you guys! Not to mention the suburb customer service of the Senso Support Team. Six months after I purchased these awesome Headphones they suddenly stopped powering on, the blue light indicated that the unit had a full charge and I still could not get the headphones to turn on. So I reached out to customer service via emailed and I had a response within minutes, I tried to troubleshoot the issue and preform a factory reset but still was unsuccessful, it turns out I was covered with a 1-year warranty and they sent me out a new pair the same day. I could not be happier with the end result.

This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones, but I really like them.  Quick charge, super easy to pair, and they sound phenomenal.

10/10 - Would recommend


These headphones are AWESOME! One of the main reasons I got them, other than because my old headphones broke, it because I go to the gym all the time and it got really annoying to have to keep my phone in my pocket just to listen to my music while working out.After using them for over a week now, here are a couple notes...1. While it says they have a 30 foot range between the headphones and the connected device, I've been twice as far away and still heard clear, crisp audio.2. The audio often gets choppy at first when reconnecting to the device you were previously connected to (i.e. after powering off, powering back on and trying to pair). I've gotten around this a couple times by fast-forwarding and/or scrubbing the file, but it doesn't always work.3. The headphones aren't weighted enough in the earpieces themselves, so often times one side will hang much more down my neck than the other side. Don't get me wrong - I like that they're very lightweight, but perhaps if the earpieces were weighted more (evenly), this uneven slipping of earpieces could be avoided.4. The noise cancelling abilities are decent, but they don't completely block out the noise. When I say noise, I don't mean wind passing over them as I'm running, or something. Most noise cancelling headphones can't even block that out. It's just that I can still hear some sounds with the volume up, even though it's usually not very much.Overall, I really like these headphones. They're a great, cheaper alternative to the Bose sport headphones, and they have pretty good noise cancelling capabilities given the price. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some cheap, durable, noise cancelling headphones that give you the freedom of wireless headphones without sacrificing the quality.

Amazing product, customer service, and warranty


I bought these headphones back in March 2017, and absolutely love them. They provide quality sound and bass. The battery life is great - just charge it how the manual describes. They served me very well until February 2018, when the left headphone started cutting out due to physical strain on the cable. I contacted Senso directly, and they responded within the day with a technical solution. Since the technical solution did not work, the one year warranty covered replacement. The sent out a replacement pair, and I received those within 2 days. I was so glad to have a new pair, and would buy another pair from them since the quality, customer service, and warranty are great. Amazing customer service, and awesome product! Highly recommend this pair of headphones for aspiring on-the-move audiophiles.

Fell apart after 3 months


They worked well for three months and I liked them during that time. However, they stopped working today and would no longer turn on. I played with them a bit, and tried a few different button combinations to see if that would work. Instead, the volume button popped off and I'm stuck with a flimsy paperweight.

Good sounding wireless headphones


Good sounding wireless headphones, especially for the price. Going from my Bose QC15's to these shows their distinct lack of highs and mids, and they sounded muddy out of the box but are getting better with use. The biggest issue I have so far is that they are far too loud at the lowest volume setting for use in a quiet room, library, at home, etc. At the gym, they're loud but fine since lifting and running requires some volume to block out noise around you. First week has shown good battery life- time will tell how they last! But for the price they are comfortable and work very well.

Fine headphones


They work pretty well. Ok sound, good construction, good accessories. One small complaint: the buttons for next song and previous song should be swapped. Previous sing is towards the front of my head and next song is towards the back of my head, that's reversed from what I would expect. Same story for volume up and down which share buttons with next and previous song.

Great Wireless Headphones! Thank you SENSO!


I've been using these for over 2 months now. These SENSO Headphones are a big upgrade over my previous 'connected' earbuds!Positives: reasonable price, easy to set up and pair with your phone,very lightweight, stay in place while running/walking, microphone works great, sound quality is great, love the pause button and recharge time.Suggestions: I tend to run with the wire in the back of my head. The wire tends to 'twist' and pull on one ear as I run, and I have to keep re-positioning it. I think that a small alligator clip that you could attach to the wire and clip to the back (or front) of your shirt would solve this problem.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, and would recommend it highly!

Great Inexpensive Activity Earbuds!


I love the ease of use, design and utility of the earbuds. This is my third pair, 1 for home, 1 for work, and 1 for my ex partner (his are still going strong after 2 years!).  They are the easy to use (connectivity), great sound quality and button response, light weight, and decent battery life. They are durable and have withstood a lot of abuse and use! I've used them in rainstorms, on the beach/boat, and at amusement parks. Unlike other earbuds, I'm not worried about loosing one or both, as the strap is a life-saver, and the ear holder, helps to keep them in place during activity.  Only downside is the battery life could be better.

This product for me is amazing. it got that when I rode through a thunderstorm for about ten minutes and still works. The sound quality is great. Connects to most devices seamlessly. Has only three buttons but you can make calls with the headset (the last number dialed), skip songs and end calls. For some reason when I get a WhatsApp call though and I press the multi-function button it ends the call. All in all a great product I would recommend to anyone who wants to talk while on the go or being productive OR who just wants to work out and don't have to worry about headphones dropping out of their ears and still be able to have the music in their ears.

With the price, quality and the shipping time, I went ahead and purchased them. He has been happy so far.

Choppy sound quality, small battery


If you stay absolutely still the sound quality could be okay. I specifically bought these headphones for the gym. I can be doing deadlifts, barely moving and there will be annoyingly poor lapses in sound quality. That is when my phone is 5 feet away. If you are 10+ feet away from the device you are connecting to, the sound quality will be absolute trash. AVOID.

The headphones are great. Only two problems


The headphones are great.Only two problems:Battery: before my run, I left with what looked like an 80% charge shown on the top right next to the headphone icon (Iphone 7 plus).  About 15 minutes into my run I get a warning the battery is low.  Then I continually get the warning every minute or so till the headphones get shut off.Wind noise: there is a lot of it, you need to crank up the volume to drown out the wind.

I like them at the price point, but the connecting line is very annoying; it's too long, can't be adjusted, and it sticks to my skin since it's slightly rubbery in texture. This is especially annoying if I use the headphones for working out. The manufacturers should design it so that the length can be adjustable and the texture won't catch on skin.

So far, so good.


I've had these for a week now and so far I'm quite impressed. For the past year prior to these I was using the Jaybird X2's and try as i might, they just weren't working for me. No matter what tips and fins i used the X2's just wouldn't stay put in my ears. Trying to workout while constantly having to adjust the buds just became too frustrating. I've not had this problem with the Senso's...once they're in, they stay put. The fit and feel is more than comfortable. As for the sound, I'm no audiophile but to me, they're every bit as good as the X2's. The X2's may have a little more bass but that's it. At 1/3 of the price of the X2's I could not be happier with this purchase. Time will tell as to the durability but if they even only last me a year, they'll have been plenty worth it.

Outstanding Customer Service / Quality product for the price


Great sound quality at an incredible price. The only flaw I found was the one size fits all ear hook. However, after some time and effort, I was able to find the perfect fit. Or at least I adapted to them. Not a big deal. Shouldn't deter from you purchasing.But the real reason I'm giving 5-Stars is Senso's customer service. For a reason unbeknownst to me, they stopped working after a few months. However, I contacted Senso, and that day had new headsets mailed out to me that same day. In my opinion, top notch customer service always warrants a 5-Star request. Regardless of any issues with the product. I recommend these to anyone in the market for quality Bluetooth headsets at a great price.

The Real Thing — Reliable, Good Sound and Signal


This is a crowded category, with products that come and go daily. They look identical but the manufacturing quality varies wildly. I’m now one of three people in my little office who have gone for the Senso Buds. They work great with phone or computer Bluetooth and Skype. They hold a good signal in most conditions and don’t drop and reconnect like other headsets. Battery life is around five hours of music. The sound is quite good. To do better, you’d probably have to spend 4x as much.

... been using these headphones for 2 weeks and I love the product


I have been using these headphones for 2 weeks and I love the product. The Bluetooth connection is quick and smooth with great sound quality. Much better than my experience with my previous headphones. One minor gripe is that henever I get the ""battery low"" message it is already too late. It gives you about 10 minutes before switching off which isn't enough time if you are in the middle of your exercise. I wish the ""battery low"" message is given 1 hour in advance (which was the case with my previous headphones). with 1 hour notice I will be able to finish my exercise and then immediately charge the headphones for my next use.

Good sound quality


I like the sound, but find that it starts breaking up whenever I leave the room that contains my tablet or computer.  It also breaks up if I move around a lot.  The design of the earbuds make them difficult to fit the ear and they are uncomfortable after wearing them for more than 15-20 minutes.  The fit would probably be better if the part that goes around the ear was more firm.

Not for me


I used this product for calls.  It did not work for me. As habit and safety reasons, I only use the right side when driving. The left side kept sliding down my shirt. The slightest turning of my head to the right would pull the piece from my ear. The cord is stiff.

Senso used to be one of the best inexpensive ways to have good battery life and a killer sound . The last pair I got , the speakers were blown out and the battery life was shot .I had send them back and will never trust their brand again .

Save your $$


This is the first Amazon review I’ve written but I felt compelled to warn people to stay away. I bought these headphones because I just wanted something to use for an hour a day when I work out. Evidently that’s a hard sell. When you start to sweat, the sound cuts in and out. After 6 months, they totally died. I was still under warranty, so they sent me a new pair. Those ones died shortly after too. Such a disappointment and these 5 star reviews are very deceiving. With two failed pairs in a year, I just can’t see how they are accurate.

Chris Senso earbud review


I have been very satisfied with the earbuds. The only issue I have had is peeling back the plastic strip covering the charging port. I needed a knife to pry it open. I understand it has to be water tight. Nevertheless, I am very satisfied. When walking on windy days there is a lot of ambient noise from the wind. Perhaps this in unavoidable.

Perfect for music, ok for calls


Great wireless earbuds, especially for the price! My only wish was if the ear hooks were slightly firmer, but hey, that's my ears. I appreciate them for music and what not, but they're not totally the best for phone, as you either need to keep them dangling from your neck at all times or in your ear at all times in order to answer a call quickly.

these headphones are really good. The sound quality


First off, these headphones are really good. The sound quality, with the memory foam type ear tips, is extremely clear and has an excellent bass quality. The battery lasts all day and they charge quickly. They don't fall off my ears or come out of place. They are comfortable and light weight for having such a lasting battery. I haven't had any trouble connecting them to my blackberry q10 or my iPhone 6. The customer service is outsatanding. They have gone above and beyond for me and treated me like I was their only customer, which I'm sure I'm not. I am so glad I didn't spent two or three times the money on Bose or beats ""by apple"". These compare quite closely to them and I'd say this is a company to keep an eye on, for sure.

They last exactly 23 minutes and die


I purchased these while visiting the US. They did everything right up until the moment I used them for my intended purpose: Running.The Good: they sound great and have a powerful bass. They also connect to bluetooth in android with no issuesThe Bad: The battery life is horrendous. Even when it appears that they are fully charged based on the light indicator, you have to plug them overnight in order to get decent charging. Even when fully charged they typically lasts no more and no less than 23 minutes (at least in my specific case). Sometimes, they also just disconnect from bluetooth and remain ""on"" and it is impossible to turn them off.  Bottom line, they are glitchy and the battery sucks.

Good sound and fit, and super tough


These sound good and thanks to the different size ear buds that are provided, I could find a pair that fit my ear canals well and stay put while I work out. I also accidentally ran them though the laundry both washing and drying.. Yet they still work perfectly. Great bang for the buck.Edit: These went through the washer and dryer and still work fine.

A great product.


I use these when I go to the gym. They work great, and are wonderful, even keeping out of the way of my hair when it's swinging to and fro. I don't use them as much when I run along busy roads because they don't cancel out much road noise. But they are great on quiet woodland paths, and in the gym. We've ordered several pair, and love them!Elizabeth MillerI bought a pair to use at the gym, and found I use them a great deal when listening to college lectures for my online program, and when calling home when I'm away.

Buy these headphones!


I did quite a lot of research looking for some sporty wireless headphones for my active fiancee. I was driven to find the best pair I could under $50, and kept coming back to these. After reading dozens of reviews and watching every video about them on YouTube I made the purchase. My girl was really wanting something high end from maybe Bose or some Beats, and really these are like budget Beats and I'm told even more comfortable. And wow was the sound better than any of the negative comments I had heard about them! Now they aren't going to blow the mind of an audiophile but they are more than adequate for their function! If you want some solid, comfortable, LOUD, and highly functional wireless buds that won't break the bank you can Not go wrong with these!!! Highly recommend!

They are easy to use. I only have a couple of issues. I like to watch my iPad at night in bed with earphones. The sound is great but I have to lay on my back the whole time. I cannot lay on my ear due to the buds sticking out too far. Also I have small ear holes and they can be a little uncomfortable. The hooks that go around the ears aren't really useful.

doesn't turn on after a couple months


Doesn't hold a charge very long and after a couple months of having them they won't turn on. It takes about 5 minutes of trying before it will eventually turn on but then it shuts down on it's own after a short while. Also started randomly pausing/changing tracks on it's own. I really liked these when i first got them and they worked properly but they just didn't hold up.

Revised review: Used them just several times now


Can't beat the price and the sound is quite good. I also didn't realize that there's a build-in microphone for phone calls (I wasn't event thinking about that when I got them!).  Connecting to my phone was very simple as was turning the volume up and down.  Once I started walking, I had a few problems with them not quite connecting properly but I think it was the arm holder my phone was in.  Once I switched arms, the headphones worked great.  I think the arm holder was hitting buttons on my phone.The carrying case the headphones come in is adorable and convenient. The instructions are great- easy to understand with helpful hints such as: Don't use with a fast charger.  It also came with a car charger that has 2 USB ports and a very long charging cord.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with these at this point.Update to earlier review:4 stars due to range but otherwise really like them.The headphones don't seem to have much range.  If I'm more than 10-12 feet from my phone,  they cut out. One benefit,  I guess,  is that it's harder to set my phone down somewhere while wearing my headphones and then walking away,  forgetting about my phone. But I can't walk around my house...I have worn these while running - they stay put fairly well but you've got to make sure they are rotated properly.  Also,  I thought I had the smallest sized ear pieces on but I found a smaller size in the carrying case.  Made the headphones much more comfortable.

Good to listen music, mic is not that great ...


It's a good product with fast connectivity.Good: Audio quality is great, connectivity is fast and effortless, the case is beautifull, the cables and car connections are good add onsBad: The ear hooks are too much flexible but the real bad part is the mic. It is not good positioned (in ear) so it's too distant from your mouth and you get a lot of unwanted noise in the conversation and a low volume. It would probably be a better choice to place it in the cord

These do work well, but they take longer to connect than the last ones I had. Although it says its connected, they still don't play the music. I have to turn them off and back on again and eventually I get them to connect. Once connected they seem to work well. Also, the power button is not in a great place. Anytime I try to push the headphones into my ear, I end up turning them off. Other than that they are good headphones.

The over-ear holders are super floppy...sometimes making it slightly difficult to get over your ear.I don't know how it will handle if you go running...I just use it at the gym on the machines cycling/stair/elliptical machines.Pairs up timely for phone calls, but sometimes takes a minute or two longer to pair up for media audio.

Function well.  Battery runs out fast.


These headphones work great. The speakers are easy to hear, the microphone picks up clearly.  The range is about 25 feet with no obstructions. My only complaint is that the battery runs out rather quickly.  I've found they have about 45 minutes to an hour of talk time and a day or two of stand by time. If I forget to charge them overnight, I'm back to using the wired ear buds.

Changed the earpods but no help as the right earphone is not working.Great product and fast, efficient delivery- quick to setup and connected to my iphone 7+ immediately on bluetooth.my problems with other earphones have either been they don't fit when I am on the treadmill or the earphones don't ""feel"" right when I am running.

It's crazy annoying that they just stop being connected periodically


This is the only set of Bluetooth headphones I've ever owned, and I've owned five others, that consistently disconnect while using them. I have a galaxy S9 now and have had the previous three versions. Every other set I've had just auto-connect when my phone's Bluetooth is on. This one takes going through the motions every time. And they just disconnect randomly when I'm walking around. I think it's when my phone finds a new Bluetooth device but I won't blame my phone's settings. No other device I've owned does this. It's crazy annoying that they just stop being connected periodically.The sound is great, the fit is great, but since they constantly disconnect I gotta go zero stars. Staying connected is just way more important than anything else.

So far I'm very happy with them. The sound quality is much better than I expected, with surprisingly robust bass. It would be nice to have an option to rewind 10 seconds with the push of a button instead of just having the option of starting a track over but that's a small nit. The are comfortable for medium periods of time but after a couple of hours my ears hurt a bit. Nothing outside of what you would expect for an over-the-ear configuration and I might be able to eliminate that by exchanging earpieces (although the default ones seem to fit fine).

Love These Senso Headphones!!!!


Bass, stability, and sweatproofing are great. From a guy that perspires profusely, I have been using these headphones for the past 6 months while running, lifting, and basketball shoot-arounds with no major issue. One thing I'd like to see improved but not worth a star is the low battery notice 5 minutes before it shuts off. It keeps saying ""battery low"" approx. every 30 seconds which is annoying. Just say it a few times within the last 30 minutes of battery life and I get the point. But charge them once a week and that is not an issue. I don't care about a lower case 'b' on the side of my ear while I workout to show I'd spend $100+ on headphones. These things have great value, great sound, and the one year warranty shows the manufacturers stand behind the product. Well worth the buy.

They connect quickly and without issue. The range is OK. They actually stay in my ears pretty well and they don't feel like they are strangling your ear holes. They rest on your ears not in your ear canal.After owning them for 6 months, I'd say worth the $29 for sure.

I even took them to the gym and they made my workout experience a pleasant one. They are light and adjustable enough for them to not be in the way during an intense workout. The sounds quality is remarkable as well as how you can control phone calls, volume and changing tracks with only 3 buttons.

I would never go back to a wired headset now.


The headphone jack went out on my phone, so I ordered this set of Senso Bluetooth Headphones.  They work really well, sound great, and work up to about 30 feet away line of sight.  I use them at the gym all the time and the ear hooks allow them to stay where they are supposed to be.  I would never go back to a wired headset now.  Highly recommended!

Just Awesome


These are simply awesome headphones.  Exactly what I expected...light, comfortable, stable Bluetooth connection to my Galaxy Edge 7S, and great sound. Compared to my wife's Plantronics in a similar style, I much prefer these.  They are not quite as compact as hers, but the improvement in sound quality is well worth the little extra bulk.  I highly recommend these headphones.

Not ideal for small ears or running with


I bought these headphones because they had good reviews, specially for the fact that reviews said they were good for fitting small ears and great for working out.I have very small ears and these headphones fit very uncomfortably, despite there being three different sizes to choose from.Also, when working out, specifically running the cord in the back is very long so it bounces up and down which is really annoying.Overall, I would not purchase again.

Disappointed


I have a earlier version of these headphones and I like them! So when an advanced pair came available i'm thinking all right. With that being said ,maybe I got a bad pair BUT I can't even have my phone in my pocket and it loses the blue tooth signal. Also I can't get more than 5 yards away and the headphones start breaking up. This is with my phone and headphones fully charged. With the previous version I can walk from the front yard to the back without any problem. In addition these aren't truly ""noise cancelling"". They do eliminate outside noise better than the original but  version but louder noises still can be heard.

Pretty Well Polished Headphones


These headphones are definitely worth the price. They work well and have plenty good enough battery life. After a while, I notice that some of the points where they put pressure on my ears do start to hurt a bit but that could be just the shape of my inner ear and not a result of the design. Audio quality is good enough for podcast listening and passable for music listening. The ingress protection rating of X7 means they should be water proof up to 1 meter, so be aware of that. Overall, decent product.

Capable Wireless Running Headphones


Just completed my first run with these and they worked flawlessly!  The sound is a bit bass heavy but throwing the iOS ""flat"" EQ on cleaned up my rock tracks nicely.  They don't really hold a candle to my Shure ES215s but for wireless sports headphones at this price I really can't complain.  If you're used to running with 215s you won't really notice a huge difference in sound while running...and if you do...run harder :D

Worked well, but I've had two pairs fail on me in about a year.


The headphones sounded fine when being used to partially squash the kill-me-now boredom of treadmills. They worked fine outside too. But this is my second pair that has failed. Senso was helpful and sent a replacement when the first one stopped working in a few months. The second pair works, but will not hold a charge. Unless I remember to charge them *immediately* before use, they are dead, and if charged they don't hold up for too long. Outside, I can live with this.  But....imagine my plight as I approach the indoor hamster wheel on a cold or rainy day ...only to find my headphones not willing to do their part in saving my sanity? Yes, I know #firstworldproblems and all that.  It has been just over a year since my original pair (and 8 months since my second).

Great price for the product.  They fit well and I've had no issues with the battery.  In fact, I've only charged it once since I got them with moderate use.  No connection issues and they fit comfortably.  The only issue I have is that they broadcast heavy low end which drowns out the mid and highs and makes for a muffled sound.  it's certainly something that I can get used to, but could stand to be a little more crisp

Good value for money


These weren't EXACTLY what I was looking for, personally. I have a really hard time finding in-ear wireless headphones that don't hurt my ears. I was hoping these just kind of clipped on to my ear and didn't actually need to go in but that was my fault as a buyer. That being said, they are much more comfortable and work better than other more expensive earphones that I've purchased. Easy to connect to devices. The on/off/pause/play button is easy to accidentally press while adjusting them while on. I would have like to see them advertised as ear phones or in-ear headphones, though.

Total win here! Comfortable ear buds that stay put even when running and weight training; the gel-type ear hooks are amazingly comfortable - I was worried they would be to flimsy - and help hold the ear buds in place. The set-up and pairing was a breeze. The controls, albeit somewhat small, are easy to use. And the sound is absolutely fantastic!! Make sure you dial back your volume - these things pump it out! The noise cancellation is actually pretty decent and remove most noises from the gym. I highly recommend these ear buds for anything/anyone active!!

Great headphones originally bought one last year but lost it so i decided to get a second pair but what really got me to buy it in the first place was the price and the 1 year warranty that came with it. Never thought i'd need that warranty but sure came in handy. My second pair was defective after using it for roughly 5 months so i contacted support and received a reply literally less than an hour later with troubleshooting steps. Once all steps had failed i was simply shipped a new one and given an apology. Product is awesome and if you happen to have any issues with it while still under warranty they sure have the nicest and most helpful support i've ever talked with.

Needed something more practical to workout with since having an arm band and traditional headphones was more or less annoying. Read some reviews on these and was sold.

Great headphones at a tremendous value.


These headphones are quality and a great value. It is about perfect. I wish the ear hooks were a little more firmer but that is more personal preference as someone else could find it uncomfortable. The audio quality overall  is good but during a phone call the person on the other line may find it a little difficult to hear you if you have a lot of ambient noise. Inside of a car you can be heard clearly, but when I'm in public I take off the right ear piece and hold it in front of my face and can be heard without a problem. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase for the price. For what you get, these headphones could justifiably be priced higher.

The headphone sound is okay, it does not cancel noise at all. Also, the loops that go over the ear are too tall. They loop in my hair and not the top of my ears. The placement of the mic makes my callers have to constantly ask what did I say. The only way I remedy that is to take the ear bud out of my ear where the microphone is and let it sit on my chest as I speak. Please fix that.

Not bad, but the over ear part just broke, so I cant rely on it staying in the ear. It simply broke while i was putting it on; it seemed flexible, but it broke. I havent used them much.

They’re no different than any other cheap pair and they hurt my hears... but I won’t of accepting the pain for nonskip...Oh and they’re not held together very well.

Just what I needed for cycling and mowing the lawn.  When riding the bike wind noise can be so bad that you cannot hear other headphones but the good fit eliminated that.  Similar situation when using a riding lawn mower.  These block out enough ambient noise that you can enjoy the programming/music at a reasonable volume.  Comfortable enough that there is no lingering feeling after wearing them like is the case with some.

I had bought the beats earbuds recently and was pretty happy with all but the price


I had bought the beats earbuds recently and was pretty happy with all but the price. I found these on Amazon and after considering the reviews, bought a pair. The quality of sound is primary to me and these do not disappoint. They sound better than the beats at a fraction of the cost. The right controls in the right places is also huge, and they are comfortable. I wear these for hours at a time, all day at work, lengthy gym sessions and for long runs. I went ahead and bought a second pair so that I have a backup always charged and ready to go. I like background music in everything I do and these are perfect for me. Nice job on a great product!

These earbuds are by far some of the best that I've ever purchased and I have had some pricy ones. The fit is so comfortable and what great sound!

and I'm not a fan of the ""look how great of a deal you're getting these are normally SO ...


Before I go into my review, I'm going to clarify something: These are listed as being on sale for $37 when they are supposedly $170 headphones. These aren't even worth $80, and I'm not a fan of the ""look how great of a deal you're getting these are normally SO expensive."" I figured the original price would be inflamed a little bit, but not by $130. I would have considered something else had I realized this.For the actual review part; I'd consider it about a 3.5 star bundle FOR $37. It comes with a car charger, a nice case, an adapter, different buds for your ears, and the actual headphones. The wireless connection is stable, the battery life is pretty long, and they fit comfortably in your ears.But the most important part of my review is about the poor sound quality. Most of the music I listen to has a fair amount of bass, and it can be completely overpowering to the rest of the song with these headphones. The highs are not very sharp, and generally the sound is muffled. I can't comment on the mic but it doesn't really matter, I got these for running and will be getting a different pair for general use. These are nothing special for $37 (and it's extremely distasteful to market them as an ex-$170 pair imo). Even my $20 skullcandy wired headphones produced much better sound quality surprisingly (and I never considered them good). Also, it might just be my pair, but they need to be positioned correctly to charge. However the battery life is long enough that it doesn't bother me.Finally, connecting them to a different device is a hassle. I have other bluetooth devices and the only way to pair them to something else is by disabling bluetooth on the device they're currently connected to.These could be great for you and the sound quality might not bother you. I make music as a hobby and have sort of developed an ear for equalizing songs, so it's possible I'm just noticing what others don't. But it's extremely noticeable to me. And just to reiterate, I'm not grading these as $37 headphones, I'm grading these as $170 headphones on sale for $37, because that's what it's listed as at the time of this review.

Solid running BT headphones.


These a very nice workout headphones. The mic for calling works surprisingly well. I like the over ear feature for running as they never fall out of the ears.The only drawbacks are: 1. They are slightly more bulky than plain ear buds (not as stylish). 2. Because they don't jam snugly in the ear you lose quite a bit of the bass punch.

Just got them out of the box and they are fantastic. Great sound quality (and I'm a bit of an audiophile) the little hooks keep them on your ears really nicely and they're made of soft rubber so they aren't going to be irritating like most other hook style headphones. I've been walking around my apartment with no connection issues whatsoever. Super comfortable even with a ski mask on. It even came with 2 USB cords (one had an attached adapter for an iPhone or android charger) and a usb car adapter with a fast charge slot. Way nicer than I was expecting. I would buy it again without hesitaion.

These headphones are good for the price. If they were any more expensive I would give them 3 stars. I am taking one star away because I wish I could be further from my device and maintain a solid connection, I am only able to be about 15 ft away before the connection fades, it also loses the connection from my iPhone and won't fully reconnect for minutes sometimes.I use these mostly listening to audio books while working out at the gym or doing chores around the house. They are very comfortable but not noise canceling.

I'm content, not sure I'd get them again, but happy with my purchase.


I have been enjoying my new bluetooth earbuds for a week now. I use them for audio books, podcasts, video and some light music listening. I answered the phone once so far with them on.Right away I am glad there are 3 earbud sizes that come with the product. Oddly enough I used the medium in my right ear and small in my left. If they wear out that fact will be helpful because I can switch them out. I wonder how you would get new ones?I was able to follow the simple directions to charge and set them up without any trouble.I am able to hear clearly. They begin to cut out when I am three rooms over...not bad in my opinion. I am disappointed that the volume does not go very low. I was hoping I could listen at a lower volume level.Unlike other devices, I was able to switch between my phone and iPad without having to turn bluetooth off and disconnect from the first device.I was disappointed that there is a flashing light while the headphones are in operation. I was watching a movie with the lights out and they periodically flash light which I find annoying. Also, if someone else is trying to sleep in the dark while I'm using them, I don't want to disturb them with the light.The charge has lasted about a day and a half with moderate listening.Overall I'm happy with the purchase.

I have had these headphones now for a little over a year. I have used them almost everyday since I got them, whether it be for music, youtube, etc. As of writing this review, I have noticed the first sign of deterioration a couple days ago. The glue keeping the cable in the left side has given, so every now and then I have to push it back in. Other than that this product has been worth my purchase and I when my current pair eventually give, I with most certainly buy another.

After further evaulation I find these earbuds to be very comfortable and they rock the music so loud I have to cut down the volume on my iphone!

ok but not great


Updated review:  I initially rated these 3-star but am changing to 1.  The more I use them, the more I dislike them.  Key points of dissatisfaction:  1) They inconsistently link to my devices.  Sometimes the earbuds will automatically to a device to which they've been previously link, sometimes I have to re-link them manually and it can take a few tries.  And this is not limit to one device, happens to all three with which I use these.  2) If the buds are linked to more that one device simultaneously, and all of them are within range of the buds, and they are being used by one, as I get out of range of the other(s), I get a beeping sound, then static, as I'm listening to another device via the buds, e.g. they are linked to my phone and ipod; if I am in the yard listening to my ipod and the phone is in the house, and I get far enough away from the phone that the buds are losing their connection to it, I hear clicking and the get static or other interference as I'm listening to the ipod.  Even though I am not listening to anything on the phone.  The only way to eliminate the static is to manually disconnect the phone from the earbuds which means I have to go through the re-linking process with the phone the next time I want to use it with the buds ( and put up with the annoyance of that inconsistent process - see #1 above).  3) These are not great for active exercise.  The ear loops are soft and flexible and do not folds the buds in place during high intensity activity - I continually have to adjust them.  4) Battery life is not great - starting with fully charged buds, if I work in the yard for the afternoon, I run out of juice before the end of the day.  In my earlier review I said I was considering returning but learned that I was past the return period so I'm stuck with them.  I recommend looking at alternatives.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Initial review:  These are my first bluetooth headphones and I use them primarily at the gym or while working around my house.  I was tired of catching with cord of my wired headphones and yanking out of my ears but was doubtful that I'd get decent quality from bluetooth.  The literature indicated that bluetooth quality has increased and the reviews of these were positive so I ordered.  My experience is mixed.  Sound quality is fine but other issues are disappointing/annoying:  1) Using at the gym is so-so; for lifting weights or stretching they're fine but when the pace picks up, e.g. running on a treadmill, they are wobbly in the ears.  The loop that goes over the ear is a flexible rubber-like material that does not hold them tightly so I have to regularly push them back into place.  2) I use them with an iPod and Android phone. Sometimes they connect immediately but other times it take a few tries; it's frustrating that connecting to the same device works fine one day and not the next when I follow the same process.  Sound is generally stable and clear but other times it's wobbly (like the sound is coming through water); again, that can vary from day to day.  Lastly, when they paired to two devices (i.e. my iPod and phone) but I am using only one (e.g. the iPod) when I get out of range of the other (e.g. the phone) the sound gets wobbly and I get a message that I'm disconnected, although the message does not identify from which device I'm disconnected (although it appears to be referring to the device to which I'm not listening).  The only way to stabilize the sound and eliminate the message is to turn off bluetooth on the other device.  Seems clumsy.  I'm considering returning them and trying another brand.  Consumer Reports recently rated bluetooth headphones and gave some high marks - the Sensos were not reviewed.

Great Product!!


Very impressed with these earbuds. After receiving them, I got them charged up fully in about 20 minutes and then after a quick pairing it was time to test them out.The fit is good and the sound is also good. Way better then some cheaper ones I purchased a couple years ago.  I did need to adjust the equalizer on the phone to turn the bass down a bit but that was a personal preference.I completed a decent 90 minute workout and they stayed on the entire time. Jogging, tire flips and some weights. I wear glasses so there is a tiny bit of movement but nothing that interruped my workout.Overall I would recommend these earbuds.Bonus points for the extra Iphone charger and Dual car charger.

These headphones are fantastic. I wanted something comfortable and lightweight for when I was at the gym/running and wanted to not feel a cable flapping around everywhere when running. This was my answer. Setting them up to my android phone was super easy, even had them sync up to my Samsung gear fit 2 easy. Sound quality is great, never had any problems with the connectivity (cleaning my apartment and leaving the phone on the table whilst listening to music and going into different rooms gave me no issue) battery life is great, I haven't had them run out on me at all mid workout. The quality for the price is well worth the purchase and the case with accessories is a great bonus. I've tried more expensive brands but this one beats them.

These head phones work great! I got them because they were discounted for an insanely low price. I love the sound quality and the distance that the Bluetooth reaches. They are comfortable and the case they come with makes for easy storage and packing.There are only two minor things I would change about these headphones. First of all the wire that connects them sometimes gets stuck in weird positions behind your head. I wish they were made of that rope-like wiring so then they would lay flat on your back. Secondly some Bluetooth headphones come with magnets on the sides so that when no listening to them you can connect them around your neck like a necklace! I've always thought that was a cool function.

Low power.


After using this thing for awhile I realize that its audio quality was okay. However, another problem became apparent. This headphone begins to spam low power messages every few seconds when it's running out of power. To me, the power might as well be dead because it spams the low power message so much that I cant listen to anything else.

I do a lot of running and a lot of traveling and I've tried now over 7 different pairs of Bluetooth headsets and these are by far the best in sound quality comfort and longevity. My only gripe is I wish there was a way to tell how much battery was left as one of the units I purchased would give you an hourly countdown. Other than that, I absolutely love these headsets and have purchased three of them. Two for me ( one that I use only for working out and then another one for daily use), and now one for my daughter. With other kids, I'm sure I will be buying more soon. Thank you for making such a good product Senso!

Great for the Price


So far so good. Not my favorite type of headphones but for the price and the recommendation I decided to give them a go. I'm really liking them so far, no problems pairing and they actually can noise pretty well. I especially like the follow up email I got from the seller. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a cheaper pair of Bluetooth headphones

Love love love this headset


These are fantastic. Great sound and the bonus is that they came with three different size ear buds. I bought two sets, one for my husband and one for me. I need mine for the gym and we both will use them when we travel. we were amazed how easy it was to set them up to our tablets. I have an iPad and he has an android.  Great price great product!

Very Nice and Exercise Friendly


Slightly heavier than I would like for exercising.  Were fairly comfortable while biking however running I used paper tape to ensure they remained in place.  Earbuds are comfortable but also am unable to wear hearing aids with them - not a big problem as I often exercise without the aid.  The USB charging cable was easy to use; the buttons are easy to find / discern function.  Positive voice when on, off, and connected rather than beeps which could be misinterpreted.  Pairs quickly with iPhone7.

Bang for your buck ratio 100:1


Extremely happy with headphones. I do not yet know if they will hold up to the punishment I dish out (I go through a lot of headphones) but the bang for your buck ratio is the highest of any headphones I've ever bought. I'm going to purchase a couple extras before they realize they can charge another 50 bucks. I'll update after a year of use.

These work great.  I have a hard time wearing anything on or in my ears for a long period of time. After a bit my ears hurt.  I am able to wear these longer than most.  The only thing I wish is if they had a bud that was a bit smaller than the small ones that came with it.  I have small canals and a slightly smaller bud would be more comfortable I think.  The packaging was nice and the extra charger is nice.

Decent for the price


I’ve owned two different pairs of these headphones myself and have recommended them to many friends and family members. The first set I owned, I had 0 problems with I just ended up losing them which is 100% my fault. But I liked them so much that I bought a 2nd set that same day. That set lasted me from early December 2017 to February 2018 and they headphones still work but the charging port broke. What appears to be a corner of the little plastic guide in the center broke off and the metal contact fell out, obviously rendering them useless since I can no longer charge them. I have no complaints with sound quality or battery life whatsoever. Sounds great, very comfortable, charges quick, and the battery does last pretty much exactly 8 hours.

A workable option, but not tailor made


For the price, these headphones often a decent sound. The mic picks up too much surrounding noise to the point that the person on the other end cannot hear my voice very well. The ear clips are too big for my ears and aren't adjustable, so with movement, they eventually fall off my ears.

I purchased these back in March 2017. I loved them after I got used to the fit in my ears, I do wish they came with a slightly smaller attachment because if I wear them for hours my ears actually get a bit sore. But...beyond that I really did LOVE the sound and clarity. I would have given 4-5 stars for performance but in less than a year the left bud stopped working and only occasionally has sound coming out. I hear static like there is a problem with the position of the wire between the ears. I now need a new set because it is very annoying to have only one working side. Overall loved them when they worked but very disappointed with only half a year to use them. I will also say I used the case when not in use and took excellent care of them.

I bought two sets of these headphones, one for my wife and one for me.  They fit me pretty well but my wife has small ears and the ear loop is much too big for her.  She has to tuck the ear loop between her head and her glasses.  Adding the ability to adjust the position of the ear loop by just sliding it up or down to the ear bud would be a great improvement.  Sound is pretty good.  They occasionally pick up wind noise and transmit it through.  I haven't had them long enough to evaluate battery life, etc.

These ear buds are nice and light and I found the sound quality good.  They stay put and are very easy to operate.  The ear hooks are very pliable so they don't take any ""break in"" period.  I would not hesitate to order these again, but with how robust they seem, I doubt I'll need to.  They also come with a compact hard sided case to protect them in your bag.  Buy 'em and enjoy!

These headphones worked great for me for several months (mostly used for running - comfortable and good sound quality, they didn't fall out of my ears, and the part that bends over your ear worked fine with my glasses on). Then they stopped working suddenly. I contacted Senso Customer Support and after a factory reset didn't work, they had a new set of headphones on the way to me within hours of my original request for help. I look forward to getting my replacement headphones and getting back to wireless running!

These are my favorite wireless headphones - so far. High quality sound and very comfortable. With the ear loops, they stay on.

You get what you pay for. Headphones that fall out...


I personally am not a fan of these. After my last pair of gym headphones finally gave up on life I decided to pick these up.I have been unable to find a way to get them to stay in my ears while working out, they are too heavy and the weight is distributed to far away from the ear so they tend to try to tip out despite the best efforts of the cheap over ear ""clip things"".I also find them to be very uncomfortable.Low battery warning only triggers with about 15 minutes of charge left,with no other indication of power level. This means you have to keep very close track of how much charge is left.I also experienced a lot of issues pairing them with my phone (Google Pixel, first gen).Only thing keeping them from one star is passable sound quality and cheap price.

I used these for 1.5 years as my go-to workout headphones. They have good sound quality and battery life.

Terrible sound quality out of the box


Right out of the box, the bass on these headphones sounded like it was completely blown out. I can't turn up the volume barely more than a whisper without having the bass scratching and bleeding. Based on other 1-Star reviews, it appears that they are just super unreliable in terms of quality - any given pair might be better or worse than another. I'm going to try to trade these in for a new pair and see if that solves the problem.Otherwise, range and connectivity seems fine, and I like the design and how the hooks can mold around your ear for a snug fit.

Excellent everyday jogging headphones


I jog with my headphones 2 miles a day five times a week. If they are not charged then the connection for Pandora is spotty. I have multiple ear piercings and the headphones are sometimes difficult to adjust to my ears. It takes a little bit of effort but just like everybody else says once you get it to the perfect spot the headphones don't fall out.

Better Than Expected


First purchase of blue tooth headphones.  Purchased in order to go phone-free during workouts after the recent gift of an Apple Watch. Very easy to set up.  Comes with so many accessories (home charger, car charger, storage case, several ear bud sizes, and clip to shorten cord). Extreme value for what you get here. Did not have high expectations with regards to sound, but highly impressed. Many Bluetooth earbuds go for more than double & triple the cost...these were an outstanding value for what you get, and worked much better than expected.How long will they last?  That IS the question.Will update if they quit on me inside 6 months, but overall these were a great purchase for my 1st pair...and I highly recommend.

Nice bluetooth headphones at a very reasonable price!


I've only had these bluetooth headphones one day, but so far, so good!  They were easy to set up, and so far have been easy to use too.  In addition to the short charging cable, it also comes with a nice long (3-ft) cable that converts from a micro-USB to a lightning cable (handy when traveling so you only have to bring one cord to charge 2 devices, although not simultaneously).  Clear instructions, nice packaging, and the small carrying case is much nicer than just a drawstring bag that you might get with other ear buds.  I'm not finding the piece that fits over the ear all that comfortable (hence the 4-star rating) but hopefully I'll get used to them (or maybe try and adjust them so they're more comfortable). I'm happy with this purchase!

They don't sit on my ears the way they should and I think they will come off when running. I just got them so I haven't really been able to try them with a variety of different exercises.

Wonderful Product


I originally ordered one set of these but were so impressed with the quality, the sound and the accessories, I ordered an additional seven for other family members. The noise canceling and the sound seems to be comparable to the much more expensive ones I’ve previously purchased. I can honestly say for the money you can’t go wrong. Great purchase!

This is my first set of wireless headphones and I love them.  The sound is great and the ear buds come in three sizes so the right fit is there for anyone.  I noticed during my last workout at my studio I didn't need the iPod strapped to my arm.  I was able to leave it at my table and move anywhere in the studio without it attached to me with no interruption or lost sound!  Last thing, SENSO has demonstrated superior customer service in their follow up and desire to make sure you're happy with the product.  So thumbs up on this buy folks!

Right ear piece malfunction


Love these headphones- bought a pair 3 years ago & couldn’t be happier- my old ones got a little funky with the blue tooth connection when the battery was low so I thought a new pair- same quality- great fit - doesn’t fall off when running or exercising- buttttt my right ear piece : there seems to be something loose in it because when I run it’s a very obvious noise- so I might send it back: trade it in

Bought these to wear using heavy machinery and listen to music on my phone. Excellent sound quality, comfortable to wear. I can leave the equipment and step away (open gate, etc.) and the headphones stay connected to my phone. Phone call sounds are clear.Will have to see how they hold up under use.

Enjoying my headphones and feel like they are a good value.


Have only used these headphones twice so far, but am delighted with the sound and ease of use.  After jogging with plug in earphones for years using my ipod or iphone, I am happy with the switch to bluetooth.  I also use a exercise logging app, and it works well with the distance and time announcements, too.  Good product.

Nice headphones.


Upon recieving my headphones, I unpacked them, and after a brief look at the instructions, was able to connect them to my iPhone without a problem.  They were charged and worked immediately with good quality sound.  I have used them several times now, enough to have charged them using the usb port on my laptop (which took less than an hour).  I have yet to use the car charger and cord, but expect it will work as well as the rest of the package.  So far I am very impressed with the quality of the product. It is obviously well designed and thoughtfully equipped with the accessories needed to make using the headphones an enjoyable experience.  They are definitely worth the money.  I would recommend Senso Bluetooth Headphones to a friend.

AWESOME!!!


These headphones are beyond great. Very comfortable to wear, great sound and the mic works much much better than any I've tried on similar headphones. Sound is clear and crisp which is excellent, but thecomfort level is off the charts. The part that wraps around the ear is soft and pliable but just sturdy enough to hold them to your ears without worrying they will fall out.

Decent, still bluetooth, still skips.


I run with my phone in my shorts pocket, which is right at the small of my back/waist. Sometimes the connection is weakened and you get that bluetooth ""skip."" Not sure if it's inherent to all bluetooth devices or not, but some of my other devices seem to do ok at that range. Maybe I'm just too metallic and interfere with the signal.

Works fine as long as you don't have to charge it.


The device itself is mostly okay. It has okay sound not any better not any worse than most others. However, I consistently cannot get the cover off the charging port. I almost always end up having to use a knife. Which means of course that eventually it will not be water resistant like I need it to be.

Good while they lasted.


Good earphones with good sound.Problem is they didn't work at all after about a month.I am not sure if I got a bad pair but they never lasted longer than two hours at a time while in the gym. Last time I used them I had just charged them and about 30 minutes into my workout they quit working. Now they won't even turn on. The charging light wont even come on when trying to charge. I would try them out again if the company tried to make it right and send me a different pair to try. If they won't then I would look elsewhere.

Three days in and the headphones sound great and STAY in my ears


I've tried many types and brands of earbuds in the past six years.  The biggest problems I had was with the fit..... for some reason all of the past earbuds didn't fit well in my ear and always fell out with any kind of head movement.  I decided to try the Senso headphones based on the price, reviews, and 4-star and above ratings. Three days in and the headphones sound great and STAY in my ears, thanks to the over-the-ear silicone stabilizers.  The fit is very comfortable and the headphones are easy to learn and use.  CANNOT beat the price coupled with quality.  So far... so good.

Great for the price


I bought these because I use my sewing machine on the weekends, and I kept tripping on my headphone cord when I would get up to move to the ironing board.  Of course that led to my headphones not working properly.  I like to watch movies and TV progams my husband wouldn't want to watch while I'm sewing.  I used these headphones for several hours last weekend. They worked great with my tablet and they were so comfortable I forgot to take them off when I was done using them.  I'll be using them with my android smartphone, too.  They don't block out background noise like my over the ear wired headphones did, but they are reasonably priced and give me freedom of movement.  I wasn't ready to spend $200 to $300 dollars on over the ear headphones.  I'm very happy with these.

It does hurt my ear a bit


I chose an over the ear design just for extra caution so they don't fall off as I'm moving around. But I have to adjust occasionally as it starts to pinch that one spot on my ear. I guess I will find just an in-ear next... also the range is pretty low, barely can move around a 1 bedroom apartment without having to move my phone with me..

Sounds good, a little bass heavy though


I use this when I workout. Sounds good, a little bass heavy though. I can easily fix that with the equalizer on my player. They stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing during my workout, running very hard or bending over upside down. The battery lasts about 4-4.5 hours and if you haven't used it in two or so weeks the battery will be dead even if you left it fully charged. The battery life is why I'm rating this as 4 stars. I'd buy it again.

These headphones are amazing. Better than a lot of brandname ones. They definitely hold their charge since I’ve gone over a week without charging them and they still work.

Not X7 waterproof- charging plug very difficult


This may be sweatproof, but failed after a few swims in pool. This occurred on two different headsets. Swims were on kickboard, not submersing headsets more than a foot on occasion.Mini-USB charging connection is very annoying due to its location by the ear hook and the rubber flat, which combine to make plugging in the charger frustrating.

Great for iPhone 6, but terrible for Apple Watch 3


These headphones work well with my iPhone 6.  Easy to pair and great connection reliability.However, I purchased an Apple Watch 3 (GPS + cellular) and these headphones do not reliably deliver sound.  The watch in on my left wrist and it must be too far away from the headphones (I have long arms - 38 sleeve).  The sound goes in and out as I walk or run, but the sound is consistent if I hold the watch near my face.  This is unacceptable for me since I one of the reasons for purchasing an Apple Watch 3 was to be able to run without carrying my phone.

I have been using this headphones for 3 days now. I am using them with my Samsung LCD connected via a Bluetooth transmitter. The sound quality is fabalous. In this price it cannot be any better...!!! I am enjoying watching movies/tv serials using this device. When it comes to playing music videos much on my oneplus3T, the sound quality is again amazing..!! the Bass and clarity is superb. The only issue I am facing is when using them to make calls. I am getting feedback from my friends/colleagues that there is hell lot of background noise. I have tried doing a factory reset as well but the problem is still the same. Overall a good product if you want to enjoy music/movies etc, but not good when using for making phone calls.

High quality at a low cost


These earbuds are the best quality vs cost product at this price point! I read CNET's review, which recommended them highly, and I did some additional research. I bought one a few months ago, now I've come back to buy more for my family members! I've been completely impressed with them! ❤ Among 3 sets, one had a small technical issue. I emailed with customer service about it and it was amazing how thoughtful and responsive they were. They sent troubleshooting ideas that I tried, then I sent my amazon purchase order from my history and since the purchase date was within one year, they sent a replacement set. The other two pairs have had no issues whatsoever. I will absolutely buy senso again.

Great Wireless Headphones


I waited to write a review until after a few weeks of use. These are my first wireless headphones and I love them! I use them while working out at the gym and have had no issues. They fit my ears very well using the earbuds that came on them (they give different sizes if you need). I've had no issues with the sound or with bluetooth connectivity to my iphone. The battery also seems to be very good. I only charge them once a week or so, and they charge quickly. The company also gives you a carry case, micro USB/lighting cable charger, car charger and a bunch of other extras all for a great price. Would definitely recommend these to anyone.

uncertain if Tekatron honors warranty


The headphones stopped working about 45 days prior to the warranty expiring. I called tech support and they determined the headphones were not working properly and indicated I would be sent a replacement. I received an email from the warranty department saying they would replace my headphones in a few days. 30 days later I have not received my replacement headphones. I called the support line, the support representative said my case was still open and he could not tell me when it would be closed, when I would receive replacement headphone, or provide a way to escalate or call the warranty department. A very disappointing experience.

Get them!


These are very handy for me to have. I work out 4+ times a week and these are great. One of the ears stopped working after the second or third use. I was pretty upset about it. But, then it started working again and I haven't had that problem since. Can pick up calls while working out and then go back to playing music. Links quickly and charges great.

This would be fine if the LED indicator wasn't smaller than a god ...


Difficult to pair and incredibly unreliable. Unpaired the device from my Samsung S9 and recharged it again but it won't even turn on after doing all that (same thing happened when I paired it with an IPhone so it's not an android/apple issue).A suggestion to companies that make bluetooth headphones..just add a freaking ""on and off"" button. What is point off turning the device on and off by holding the main button down for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on seconds. This would be fine if the LED indicator wasn't smaller than a god damn ant or if the device actually turned on.Purchase at your own risk. There's a reason why it's only $30

Love them!!


I ordered 2 pairs of wireless headphones from amazon that I sent back before finally ordering these. I love these headphones!! They are comfortable, the sound quality is great, mic quality is good, the range is excellent, & most importantly - they aren't constantly falling out of my ears. This is my 3rd day using these & they still have a pretty full charge. I ove that they came w/ case too. I definitely recommend these

Great Buy!


I bought these headphones to replace a pair that I lost. I like these much better. They work very well and the battery charge last a long time. What I am most appreciative of is the customer service. I received an email asking how I liked my headphones. I had a couple questions and they were quick to reply. At one time, I heard a faint echo while using the phone. When I emailed the company, they sent me explicit instructions on how to reset the headphones. Great customer service goes a long way. Also, the price was great. I think they were about $50 less than the other type I bought at Walmart. Different brand but still. Thanks for a great product at a GREAT price!

I purchased this product based solely off the price and customer reviews and I must say that I am totally pleased with my purchase. This product arrived the next day after ordering it on Sat, it was here by noon on Sunday and the headphones were easy to set up and work perfect. The only thing I would suggest is to buy an armband for your cell phone if using it with that. The sound will cut in and out with your phone in your pocket, however in defense of this product that also happened with every other similarly priced Bluetooth headphones I purchased.

These are awesome. I use them while running and exercising. They don't slip. My only grip is that I think the cord should be shorter. While I'm running half the cord will fly over one shoulder and then begin pulling the opposite ear. If the cord was shorter, long enough to just go around the back of my head it would be perfect. For the price you can't beat these.

Easy to set up and start using, they need to charge first thing but it didn't take as long as instructions said. Very satisfied with sound, compared them to the BOSE sport wireless headphones = very satisfied.

Doesn’t fit ears well


Bought these headphones because my more expensive pair stopped working and didn’t quite want to shell out the money again. The sound quality of the headphones is fantastic and the battery life can last me a couple days of workouts before needing recharged.My biggest complaint about the headphones is the part that hang over top of your ears. The plastic isn’t malleable like the part is with the more expensive headphones. So while I’m running or doing anything with a jumping motion they always fall off my ear. I contacted support and they suggested switching ear plug pieces which I had already done.Overall you pay what you get I guess.

Good quality headphones, definitely not noise canceling


These headphones are nice quality , packaging is great. Comes with a few cool things. The only reason I didn't give a better review is because I feel I was tricked. If this is what I was looking for then GREAT but the biggest reason I bought them was because the false advertisement of cancelling background noise. You can actually hear more background and more vivid than the headphones I had before that DID not say noise canceling , if you don't care about the road or everything else in the background being in your conversation GO FOR IT. Just makes me question if all the other things these claim to be is true.

I have had them for over six months and they still hold a great charge, clear when working out, on the phone and the range is pretty amazing.  When on the open floor at a gym, the range is great.

Great customer service!


Update:  It was covered under warranty.  They are sending me a new one, because it never should have broke at the earpiece.  They assured me that their products go through a rigorous QA.  I just emailed a picture of the broken earned.  Great customer service!! Worked great for 10 uses.  The ear piece that is attached to the base broke off after regular use.  It was comfortable and sweet proof worked good.  For the price I would recommend it next to beats or other more expensive wireless earbuds.  Only disappointed that the plastic broke so easily.

Long Battery Life and Waterproof


They are very durable.  I like that the are waterproof since some of my runs are in rain.  They can irritate my ear on occasion during long runs, but sometimes I can minimize that by swapping ear covers.  Very good ear buds for the price!  This is my 3rd pair.  My 1st pair stopped working about 4 months in, but customer service shipped me new ones right away!  The 2nd pair lasted about 1.5 years before the Bluetooth module stopped working.  Worth the money for both quality of audio and amount of the they last.

Sadly, they don't last long...


These are great wireless ear buds -- great sound, range, controls, etc. -- BUT, they only last 3-4 months and then something goes wrong. I am on pair 3 or 4, and all of a sudden they won't charge anymore. BOTHER. Last time it was something else -- can't even remember. So, three (or four) strikes and you're out. I will have to try another brand.UPDATE: I just spoke with Senso customer support, and they are sending me replacement sets. Very impressed with my phone experience with them. I will update my review when the replacements are received.

Not bad if it kept working


I liked these headphones until the left earbud stopped working a couple months in. Occasionally the bluetooth would wig out, but in general they seemed to have a good range and I could walk around the gym with them with my phone in a cubby. Sound quality was fine and connecting was easy. Battery life seems to be around 8 or so hours. But now I'm looking elsewhere, as only one side is fully functioning, the other having dropped its volume down to almost nothing.

Pretty good headphones...


I do have to say, Senso has great customer service.  They were quick to reach out to ask about any concerns.  The headphones have great sound to them if used while in normal activity.  However, my biggest complaint comes when running.  While running the headphones seem to pull in wind noise more than any headphone I've used in the past.  I tried multiple ear pieces and made sure that the earpiece was snug in my ear, but it was still an issue.  However, the sound is top notch otherwise and the headphones stay in my ear better than ones tried in the past.

A business colleague had a pair of these and I tried them....they sounded great so I purchased them while traveling. Arrived home, paired them up with my new iPhone 7 and immediately in business.  They sound really well.  Bass and volume are good - much better than the standard ear buds that come with the phone.  Wireless also a huge benefit as the iPhone 7 only has one port now and allows you to have your phone plugged in for charging and listening at the same time.  Would highly recommend this based on my experience so far.

I've been very happy with these for over a year now. They are taken care of, mostly worn around the house. Yesterday they started to disconnect from Bluetooth randomly. Sometimes after 10 seconds, sometimes after a minute. Reset my Bluetooth settings, charged fully and they just won't stay connected. While watching a video say on YouTube, the video will pause itself and when I hit play the sound is no longer in the headphones. Departing on trying another brand. A little disappointed!

Very impressive.  However, my left ear bud is failing after 19 months.  Certainly not bad for a system failure considering the price, but not meriting a 5 star rating with consideration given to durability.  Nevertheless, I'm likely to repeat my purchase...minutes from entering this review, as a matter of fact.  They are that good...at least for a period over a year.  Some relationships fail that test.  Senso is a product that has behind it, people that care about both cost and functionality.  Well played Senso, well played!

Great headphones. Headphones stay on while running in high heat and high humidity environment. Noise quality is really good as well. Blocks out ambient noise fairly well. If you wear foam plugs you shall hear the wind while running though, but its not a major distraction. The Bluetooth signal is pretty strong but it does cut out sometimes. For some reason when I wear my phone on my arm the signal cuts out. If you keep your phone in your hands or in a location close to you signal doesn't break. Maybe it's due to orientation of the phone. This is the second of Bluetooth headphones I have purchased and they are much better than my previous pair. Other headphones Bluetooth connection was awful I had to get rid of them.

I have always used the earbuds that came with my iPhones and just assumed that was as good as it would get.  I ordered these not knowing what to think, I can honestly say my iPhone earbuds are going in the garbage.  Very clear and with plenty of bass.  I wanted headphones that were clear and full, these absolutely fulfill those requirements.As far as noise cancelling, I just put them in and cleaned my church.  I never once heard the vacuum.I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones on a budget.AWESOME!!!!

Excellent sound quality and couldn’t even hear my girls arguing with them in!!!


Just tried them out last night, awesome sound quality for my music. I don’t know yet how long the battery lasts. And as I use them more I’m sure I’ll be able to get the kinks out of the cord. Love the little carrying case for them.

So far, so good!


I bought these for my wife, who wanted to listen to music while she works out at a nearby pool. We were both pleased at how quickly and easily the headphones paired with her iPhone 6, and were very impressed at the quality of sound as well as the bluetooth reach it was capable of. She hasn't had the chance yet to try them at the pool, which is why I'm not able to give it more stars right now. But we both agreed it was a good buy! You've got a good product, Mr. Backstrom.

Better than my Bose earbuds


I am usually very tech challenged, however, I took these out of the box, read the quick and easy to follow instructions and was connected and listening to my music in 5 minutes. I even answered a phone call and had great reception. The sound is better than my Bose earbuds and having no cords prevent me from accidentally dropping my phone. I've recommended these to my friends and coworkers and 2 have already ordered. Thanks!

volume down didn't;t work


I ordered 2 sets of these, they sound good but the reason for the 2 stars only comment is that one of them which it was a gift for my GF had an issue with volume buttons didn't work properly, she was able to volume up but couldn't turn it down, so she had to use the phone every time she wanted to lower the music, i tried to contact the seller via phone but i couldn't because i live overseas

5 Stars for Gym Use


I gave it some time. I REALLY wanted the Beats Powerbeats3 wireless headphones for their W1 chip which makes pairing look super easy.I primarily need wireless headphones for the gym. Too many times have my wired headphones been yanked out of my ears when they get caught rising from a bench or walking by some gym contraption. Plus it's a PITA doing certain exercises with my phone in my pocket.After a bit of research, I chose this style of headphones because I have large ears and earbuds won't stay put. This pair of wireless headphones has everything I need; Cheap, bluetooth, volume, pause/skip, at least 6 hours of battery, sweat proof. The powerbeats3 are $150 right now, but I went with these just to try them out, even though they're sans W1 chip.I paired it with my iPhone and iPad, and I noticed the first problem. When I walk out of range of my iPad, it pauses my music and gives me a beep, and does so repeatedly until I'm hopelessly out of range (going to my garage for example). This became very annoying, so I unpaired it from my iPad. I didn't really need it paired to it anyway. Since I only have my iPhone paired to it, the headphones pair immediately.When walking around the gym, I leave my iPhone by my towel and walk around (weight rack, bench, fountain, etc.) and it maintains a strong connection. I admit that it's because I always maintain clear line of sight (don't want some bro taking my phone). As long as I don't demand multiple bluetooth pairings and just use this for the gym, I'm good to go and it's well worth the cheap price. I can't really say I care to pay far more just for the added benefit of being able to quickly pair this to my iPad, so I'm keeping these.However, and this criticism is for the style in general regardless of manufacturer, these headphone cords kinda have friction when brushing against the back of my neck. I wish there was a way to keep them up and off because when I turn my head to glance somewhere or look around multiple times, the friction is just strong enough that it eventually tugs the headphones off my ear. The powerbeats3 would more than likely do the same thing since the cord would rest in the same spot. This kinda left me keeping my head straight like I had a neck brace on toward the end of my workouts. I'll have to figure something out in order to make this work.A note on sound quality. I can't get THX surround sound on tiny little buds, so I'm not going into these with sky high expectations. That said, these sound great and my songs don't sound noticeably muted or dull. The sound is similar an average car stereo. Sound range and bass are good. I expect the powerbeats3 would probably have some sick bass, but meh. I'm going to the gym, not a sound studio so whatever ambient noise there is would leak in and drown out subtleties anyway.Overall, 5 stars because the cost savings for my application make this pair more than adequate over the powerbeats3.

Excellent Customer Service and Excellent Product!


I ordered these headphones on the claim they were sweat proof!I find them extremely comfortable and the battery last the 7-8 hours.But the charging was an issue and after 15 months they stopped taking a charge. so now I either have to plan on buying a set once a year or trying a different brand.They do black out a lot of noise such as wind while running or walking but when riding there is a lot of outside noise.

I have had my Senso Wireless for about a month and I use them every day.  I am thoroughly impressed with their performance.  They hold a charge for several days, are easy to operate, and all the accessories/case were a great bonus.  I had a small issue with connecting mine today and contacted customer service. I figured that since it was a Saturday, my email would get answered in a few days.  Within an hour, I had an answer and was given easy to follow instructions to reset my buds.  Excellent product and even better customer service.  I am very happy with my purchase and will not hesitate to order more as gifts.

GLAD I FOUND THESE SENSO HEADPHONES


I bought these headphones to replace another brand (Philips) that I didn't like. These were my first Bluetooth headphones and they were very uncomfortable.  They also kept falling out of my ears.  The SENSO headphones were much better for several reasons.  The latex cups that go into the ears came in three sizes and when wearing the correct size, they were very comfortable and stay in place.  I've worn them for extended periods of time and never had to adjust their position. When turned on, a voice prompts that the power is on and also lets you know when they connect and when the power is turned off.The volume controls and power buttons are very conveniently located.  The sound was also very pleasing.  I highly recommend them; they seem to be a very good value for the price I paid.

I was excited to get these. They paired, no problem, the first time but after that, they wouldn't. After trouble shooting many times, still they would not pair. Not sure what the problem was. They sounded great when they worked! I'd like to get another pair but am afraid that I will run into the same problem. I can't work out without music so reliability is very important.

Do yourself a favor.  Purchase these and give them a try.  The sound quality and the comfort is second to none.

Good headphones at a great price.


Bought these the other day and I really like them. They are easy to set up, have a decent sound and come in a great case with a great lightning cord (which I consider to be an extra). The only small complaint t I have is that while outside there does appear to be some extra wind noise but with the volume up you don't notice to much. I have not had them long enough to comment on battery life but they came full charged and ready to go out of the box which was nice. The cord management system is a nice extra but the cord does seem to come lose easily so I am not sure how effective this will be. Assuming these last, I would definitely buy again.

I charged them for about an hour. PERFECT. OH MY GOODNESS, THE SOUND IS AMAZING THE BASS COMES THROUGH NICE AND THOUGH YOU CAN STILL HEAR THINGS IN SURROUNDING, THE SOUND QUALITY IS SO GREAT, ALL SURROUNDING SOUNDS ARE INAUDIBLE. IM SO GLAD I TOOK A CHANCE ON THESE. I just hope they last me and speakers don't blow out or anything else. YAAAAAA IM ACTUALLY MOTIVATED TO GO TO THE GYM EVEN MORE.

They are okay for audio only (music, podcasts, or audio books).  There seems to be audio sync lag no matter how close you are when watching video.

Buy them. Don't Hesitate, just buy!


Amazingly loud, blocks out most sounds pretty well. My roommate was making a ruckus trying to get in the front door and I didn't even notice, sitting in the living room. The headphones fit comfortably and the clips make sure they won't fall out. Seriously, I went outside, sprinted, jumped up and down, whipped my hair back and forth and these things wouldn't fall out. Also comes with a car adapter charger, lightning cord, charger, replacement/different size earpieces, and a little container to carry all of this. Better than Taotronics, which are pretty good---but this is even better---because you can run with them and they are loud. Sound quality is good for most purposes.

I had a slight issue with pairing it in the beginning, but customer service was fabulous and was able to help me resolve it quickly.The biggest problem is that I can’t use them outside. They CONSTANTLY disconnect from my phone, even if my phone is near my face. They end up reconnecting on their own, but not practical for when you are talking on the phone. There are definitely better options. I use these at work now only which they work fine, but shouldn’t need two different pairs for when I go outside.

Lose connection or won't connect easily


I loved these the first time I used them on the stationary bike.  The sound is great!  BUT, I soon found out they are difficult to connect outside or at the gym, or they lose their connection for no reason, like another review said.  I will probably keep them as a back up pair in case my Powerbeats fail, again.  For the price of Powerbeats they should be better quality.  For what I paid for these I'm not too disappointed.

The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good for the price


The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good for the price, but from the very beginning it seemed that the connection in the headset had a short. This would happen when I turned my head from side to side. I only use the headphones about twice a month so they haven't been abused. With each use the disconnect got worse. Now its to the point that the headphones disconnect 5-6 times per song. Not good. Hopefully this is just a bad set. If it weren't for the shorting/disconnecting I would recommend these headphones and give it four plus stars, but the quality of this particular pair is disappointing.

deliver good sound quality


This is my first purchase of Bluetooth headphones.  I was looking for something that was light weight, deliver good sound quality, and wouldn't break the bank.  These work just fine for all three categories.  They fit snugly and don't fall out, and the carrying case is great.  The sound quality is not the greatest, could be clearer.  I tried to look at how to adjust the EQ level but it appears to just have one type.  Perhaps someone who reads this can help me out.  There have been several times where the connection cuts out, but it is not a recurrent problem and usually goes away within one minute.  Overall I am happy with the purchase, and would definitely recommend for the price.

Didn't last


I bought this based on all the good reviews. Not sure if I just got a lemon, but mine didn't last more than 6 weeks.  I used 1 hour per day for 5 days and then recharged over the weekend.  I liked it for these weeks but now in the 7th week it doesn't hold a charge.  I charged it fully on Sunday, took it to the gym to use the next day, and after 30 minutes it says low battery and shuts off.As if that wasn't bad enough, the right earpiece now plays static.  It happens even when I have nothing playing in my phone, so I'm guessing it's a loose wire??Either way, I don't recommend these.  They are low in price but as I found out the hard way, you get what you pay for.

The earbuds are not a tight fit like the way the picture shows


The earbuds are not a tight fit like the way the picture shows. They keep falling out of my ears. I'm using the small plugs but the piece that wraps around my ears is too big. Therefore I have no secure fit. I love the car charger and the warranty. I'm going to have to order a different kind. I going to order a Jabra headset that one will fit my ears perfectly. What can you do to accommodate me. Is there a Jabra with a warranty. I saw one that I would love. Also the Senso earbud is suppose too be noise cancelling but it's not. People keep asking what's all the noise. I can be driving & the sound of the wind & every moment they hear.

Out of the box the Bass was why over the top at the normal equalization I use with my Bose wired earbuds or my car system. After 20 minutes of adjusting on my Galaxy S8 I got them sounding pretty good but not as good as the Bose Buds. I had to use the manual adjustments since the the Bass on all the built in phone equalizer settings was overwhelming.  If you really, really like loud Bass or you device has a builtin equalizer they are ok. If you can't adjust you equalization manually they are probably not for you.

I ordered these earbuds to use in the gym. I don't run but walk in the treadmill, so I did not want a wire in the way. I took a chance on these because of the positive reviews and the price. Once I paired them with my iPod, I was pleasantly surprised at the comfort and sound quality. I have a pair of Bose (wired) earbuds, and they are great. But these are just as good in terms of sound quality and comfort. The bass is rich and I can hear all the instruments.  I have not taken them on a long flight, but I believe they will work just fine. I recommend this produce with confidence.

Good headphones with poor longevity


Bought these in July 2017. Survived trips to Ireland, Houston (through Harvey), and Italy. I get back to campus at Prairie View (about an hour outside of Houston) and the left earbud's sound begins to fade in and out, or cut off completely. Now only the right earbud works, unfortunately. Outside of that main issue, these are a solid pair of headphones; nothing to write home about, but good enough to get some use out of (or for people to mistake them for Beats). The only other minor issue is that the included foam noise-canceling ear tips are poor.

So I look for 3 qualities in in a set of earbuds quality, comfort, and sound. I’m happy with the quality and comfort but the sound sucks. If you like any sort of base in your music then these are not for you. The high range sounds ok but the base distorts with even a medium volume, forget about listening to loud music. I’m hoping that with a full charge they will improve (I’ll update if they do). Anyway I guess you get what you pay for. The magnetic mount and card sleeve are nice little additions.

Bought these for my teen daughter- she was able to set them up herself and has been enjoying them each day since receiving them. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there is a one year warranty on these headphones too! Can't beat the price either... all around happy that we found these headphones!

I mostly like this product for the warranty support by the company


I mostly like this product for the warranty support by the company. I bought two pairs one as a gift, one pair is giving me some problems but after starting a warranty claim with the company I got a response back within only a few hours from them. They wanted me to try something to repair it, I attempted it a few times to see if It could be repaired that way when I informed them that it didn't, they processed a replacement immediately. I think that just shows how sure they are that the product is good is when they don't hesitate to replace it if it is damaged. If their product was a piece of junk they would fight tooth and nail not to replace it, but if they are willing to work immediately to get it replaced just shows their confidence in the product.

Wont stay in ears, not good for the gym


I bought these headphones to wear for running and weight lifting. I need cordless because the cord gets in the way when I'm doing squats but also they need to stay in my ears for running.. Unfortunately these are not good. They don't stay in my ears (yes, I've tried the different sizes of buds). .they're bulky and fall out of my ears.. when I try to adjust the cord behind my head they pull the headphone out of my ears. The silicone pieces that wrap behind the ears are incredibly flimsy and way too soft to hold them in place. The sound quality gets garbled when I put my hand near the headphones and the button is so big that when I try to adjust them, i end up accidentally pausing the music.. These are much more annoying than they're worth. I'm sending them back.

Great product, screw BEATS. Unless status is what you seek


Great head set. Was worried when reviews commented in ear books.. I use them mostly for work which has me removing buds, and hanging from my ear.. works great so far..Slight suggestion I would like to give is to be able to skip songs on headset, and piece for the cord that would help shorten it.. Small details but helpful..I am very satisfied, probably best cordless headset I've used so far; which is 5 different types.Congrats on a great, well made product. The warantee certainly makes it comfortable knowing you have quality product. Plus, can't beat the price for itThank you!

sounds cuts off and bad to talk for walks much less running


Took the headphones while a walk in the park and the sound kept cutting off, much static and it was very bad in a mild wind....seems as you can hear the wind funneling in ears more that the actual music in headphones. I even try to restart it and paired device several times as a restart but it didn't help a bit.

5 Stars for the Price Alone


I've used these headphones almost daily since February, 2018 and it would be hard to beat the level of quality and sound for the price. Are there better headphones out there? Sure, but they won't cost $20-30. Also, as of September, 2018 they started having trouble taking a charge. A five minute call to customer support resulted in a new pair of headphones shipped within the week. So again, you can spend much more for better, but for the price you get good sound and quality and great customer support. I would definitely recommend.

Battery Life Grossly Exaggerated→→→Battery Failed.


I bought this headphones for my jogging and daily commute on the train. Sound quality is not great but good enough as I mostly listen to podcasts. The fit is secured enough to my ears while working out. My biggest complaint is the battery life. Not even close to the 8 hr. listen time and 240 hr. stand by time. I got 1/3 of the time claimed.Update: Battery failed after less than a month. I returned the item.

Sound quality = subpar


Sound quality is scratchy and not great. Thought these would be a cheap noise cancelling alternative to bose or song, but the sound quality is not even comparable. Would recommend if you just want eh sound and cheap wireless headphones, but not great for someone who wants bass, clear vocals, and true noise cancellation.

I have only used these buds in combination with my IPhone 7 for a week.  Worn on my daily run and in the gym five days.  The sound is great, they are comfortable and K have not lost power for use of two hours at a time.  At this point seems like a good product for the price.

One minor problem, otherwise great


These are great headphones.  I mostly listen to books and movies on them, so I can't say much about the treble/bass, but the sound is clear for what I need them for.  The only reason I give them 4 stars is for some reason they cut out when I'm at the end of my driveway, even though my phone is just in my pocket.  I have no idea why, but it's consistent, and if I turn them off and restart them there are no problems.  Otherwise they stay on my ears well whether I'm walking or running, and they were exactly what I was looking for!

Big headphones for a small price


I've been using them since November 2018. I'm amazed that it has lasted so long. The battery life is still pretty good. The sound has a good bass.They are great for working out and since last year I've been using them daily;  because of COVID19 I have been using them always for phone calls because I work supporting health care workers and sometimes its safer to use a headphone for attending phone calls rather than using your cell phone directly.

Good quality, customer service was quick and helpful


After a few weeks of use, the headphones repeatedly disconnected and reconnected to my phone, annoyingly interrupting whatever I'm listening to or whatever phone conversation I'm having.----Update------Quick conversation with customer service revealed only a factory reset was necessary. After following the directions they provided, things are back up and running.There is a small background hiss during idle, which is my only complaint about the headphones generally. Otherwise, very pleased for the price.

So Far So Good


I love the length of battery life this model offers. Perfect for when I'm on the go, at the gym, or even cleaning the house. They are flexible and comfortable too in comparison to a TaoTronics pair I owned. They seem sturdy enough as well. The only technical problem I've experienced is the connectivity with my laptop, but I think that might be less to do with the product and more so my computer. Connectivity unexpectedly gets cut off and sometimes the headphones won't connect at all unless I reset both my laptop and the headphones. Not a big deal because the headphones connect with my phone and tablet smoothly; so I'm not too concerned.  Overall, good results so far.

I'm stealing my boyfriend's headphones.


I bought 2 (1 for my boyfriend, 1 for me). My boyfriend's worked perfectly... mine not so much (because, obviously... me and my bad luck). I tried them for the first time yesterday - charged it and then connected it with my phone via Bluetooth. I tried using it at the gym (very anxiously might I add) but noticed that the connection was constantly being disrupted... I was literally 1-2 steps away from my phone and the the music was going on and off. I tried putting the Bluetooth on/off, tried ""Removing this device"" from my list, and even pressed the power button for 7 seconds while connected...nothing worked. I just sent an email to SENSO so hopefully it'll be resolved soon...

You get what you pay for


Surprise surprise, you get what you pay for here, folks. If you think you're getting away with a top quality pair of headphones, then you're wrong. I directly juxtaposed these headphones with a pair of Ink'd Skullcandys (albeit wired ones) and found the Skullcandys to be much clearer. It sounds as if the Senso headphones have the higher frequencies (treble) attenuated, giving the headphones a muffled sound.Otherwise if you're not concerned with high-quality these are great headphones for the value, especially given the car charger and the carrying case.I will be returning these and will be content with my wired headphones for the time being.

Just received my new Sensos and I am getting used to the controls and  putting them on and off.So far so good.  The Fidelity is better than all the other earbuds I've tried and better than my Logitech Headset.  Once I get Bluetooth connected to my desktop I will check out the sound quality and hopefully follow up on this review.I don't use the unit for sports so that is a caveat for people who read the reviews but the comfort level is very good after an hour of wearing them.

Good for the price but weird design


These work pretty well, sound quality is solid, not amazing, but as good as I would ever need for the gym.  Fit in my ears was just ok.  The really weird thing about these is that the on/off button is right on the side (where the red circle is), and they don't stay in your ears super well, so at least once a workout I have to shove them back into my ear and then they turn off.  It's such a bizarre design flaw, esp as other buttons are better placed.

Can't keep them in, but otherwise fine


The main reason I got these over some others were the over-the-ear hooks, but they turned out to be flimsy and not really adjustable - just some loose silicone doodads that do nothing to keep the buds from falling out of my ear. I have big ear holes, so no buds stay in. Sound quality is mediocre, as you'd expect in this range, but fine for running.

DO NOT BUY


NOT worth it. just spend the extra money to get QUALITY ear phones. They never pair when you want so you have to go in and turn your bluetooth off and then (unless they are in your backpack and turn themselves on then they will automatically connect to your phone and call someone for you). Sometimes they just disconnect in the middle of usage. the pause button is located in a high-activity place so they are constantly pausing by accident. when the battery is low, it interrupts the music to tell you EVERY FEW MINUTES. after about a month of fairly light usage, the wire became so finicky that the left side doesn't play unless they are in just the right position. WORST PURCHASE EVER. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE. BE BETTER

... these earphones for a couple weeks now and am pretty happy. Comfort -- I was a little concerned ...


I've had these earphones for a couple weeks now and am pretty happy.Comfort -- I was a little concerned about the size of the earphones, that they might be heavy and uncomfortable.  They're not.  The hook that goes over the ear is soft rubber (or something) that is very comfortable and flexible.  It doesn't irritate.  The earphones come with several sizes of earbuds.  I use the ones that came on the earphones.  They rest on the entrance to my ear canal rather than inside.  I find that most comfortable while they still seal to the ear.  The earphones are not heavy; I forget that I'm wearing them.  The cable that connects the two earphones can be worn under the neck or behind the neck.  My wife says I look dorky with the cable under my neck and she is tempted to pull on it.  When I'm around her, I put it behind my neck.  I frequently listen to audio books in the evening in bed.  Just don't put your ear into the pillow; they're too big for that.Performance -- I'm pretty impressed with the sound.  I would say it sounds pretty natural without a lot of extra bass.  Compared to my stock iPhone iPods, I think these have better dynamic range too.  I normally listen to podcasts, books and music but nothing very loud.The battery life is about what is specified.  I haven't measured it because that would be difficult since I listen for a couple hours then stop, then resume later.  The key is to turn the earphones off when not in use, don't just put the audio device on pause.Operation -- The earphones charge via a USB to micro-USB cable.  They charge pretty quick, maybe an hour or less.  An LED on the right earphone tells you status.  Better is the indicator on the iPhone, a picture of a headphone to tell that it is connected via Bluetooth and a vertical bar to show the charge status.  There's a pleasant voice to tell you when the battery is low; it's insistent.  The voice also confirms when you've turned the earphones on or off and when the Bluetooth is connected.  ON/OFF, pause/play are all controlled by a button on the right earphone.  The same button is also used to answer and hangup calls.  The microphone in the right earphone works OK.So far I'm pretty happy with these earphones, especially for the reasonable price.

Break It Apart To Fix It


Really good sound quality for such a cheap price. Earbuds are relatively comfortable, but the glaring problem here is the blinking blue light. I don't know who decided this was a good idea, but when the headphones are connected it blinks a blue light constantly. I wear glasses, and every time the light would blink it would reflect in my glasses and annoy me to the point that I cracked open the earphones and jammed a knife in the blue LCD. That stopped the light from blinking and the headphones still work, so 4 stars.

Disappointing product


After 2 days of running I find that they have no ability to protect against wind noise--any breeze or greater creates wind sound in the ears sufficient to overtake the music (in my case) that I was listening to.  Additionally, the rubberish hooks that go around the ears are very flexible and slide around making that securing process less than required.  The sound is fine and ease of use is fine but the noise is a deal breaker.  The 3 saar plug sizes and shape would work better if there was an in-ear nesting shape like on my 2 other wired ear buds and the buds themselves had some approximation of a shape more friendly to the ear canal entry.  I've never had a wind problem before --sorry - I wanted them to work well but they just don't .

Sound Quality on Point, but Comfort a Downer.


I'll review this product in three things sound quality, comfort, and style. To begin I'm a very active runner and I prefer 100% to listen to music while I'm running. As far as sound quality these headphones are amazing, they can easily knock out any other big name brand out there. However, on my first trial trying to use them they aren't stable in my ears. The wire that connects the two ear pieces is too long on my opinion, and the way the ear piece itself is made makes it come out of my ear constantly. 10 mins into my run I gave up trying to adjust them and put them away. No matter how tight or half way loose or tight, or which size ear piece I used they keep falling out. I think a more conpact structure would fix the problem, but they are very stylish headphones. On the track they look amazing.

Have used these a few times around the house and so far impressed with their comfort and sound quality. Senso has a done an excellent job in the design, materials and packaging of these earbuds.

Good headphones, just not for running


Pros:  Sound quality, battery life, Bluetooth ease of pairingCons: Silicon hooks can't hold up to runningI really like the sound that these headphones produce, but only when I'm relatively stationary.  When I run or work out at the gym, these headphones flop around and fall out (at least in my experience).  The silicon tips don't stay put and the the hooks aren't rigid enough to hold things in place.Battery life is pretty awesome and pairing was super easy.

Bang for the buck!


This was the fourth pair of budget bluetooth earbuds I have owned. All the others were not as good as this pair that I have. I use these earbuds daily and feel like they are greatly designed earbuds and that fit on my ears well and do not create any pain. . A few of my friends own powerbeats and I think these can definitely compare if not better. The sound quality is good for the price and has a good amount of bass. However if you listen to heavy, bass EDM songs it won't be that great. I love the fact that the ear hooks are silicon so they wrap along your ear comfortably. Great battery life as well (8hrs+). These are a must buy if you want a good pair of working out bluetooth earbuds!

Apparently I have small ears, as the over-the-ear loop keeps falling off.  This is not a matter of the size of the ear bud.  I bought a second pair of these headphones because I adored the pair I bought a few years ago (and recently lost).  But for the too-large ear loops, these are great.

Worth the money


They're definitely a good set of headphones and are very durable.  You will find yourself looking for wireless earbuds.  I very rarely have both headphones in at the same time. As a person that rides bmx and is always in the woods they have been able to hold up for 5 months.  You can be about 20feet tops away from your phone then starts to cut in and out.

EDIT-TO BE FAIR- Please read my full review and the manufacturers reply and my reply again!These do not sound ANYTHING like described. The mids are muddy and the so called treble? It's nearly non existent. I contacted the company by email but had no reply. I have had many bluetooth headphones. This is the first that I have sent back.

Good but a little uncomfortable on my small ears


I like the sound quality, the ease of connectivity, and the accessories that came with these Bluetooth headphones.  However, none of the provided ear bud cushions are very comfortable for me.  I am a smallish female and have small ears, and after 30-45 minutes of wearing these, my ears hurt.  May try some other cushions that came with my wired earbuds to see if those are softer and more comfortable.The zip case is very handy for throwing in my gym bag.

Short lifespan, very disappointing


Unfortunately, this is the second pair of these headphones that I have owned in the last year and again they have began to falter. I understand paying for what you get, but I'm really disappointed in the lifespan quality of these headphones. I have had this specific pair for just about 8 months and the sound is beginning to go in and out from ear to ear. Not sure if I will buy again and might just end up spending money on better quality so I don't have to keep dealing with this problem.

I bought a pair of the Senso bluetooth headphones. After a month, I might've been the only one so far that had a malfunction with them; nevertheless, when I notified Senso of the malfunction I was sent a new pair ASAP. No questions asked! Great customer service. They responded to my email and exchanged the pair of headphones immediately. Almost makes me want to by a second pair now because customer service along with a great product is even better. BTW: I have been using my headphones to sync with my iPhone while running outdoors....very good feel for me.

Good headphones for the price


I bought these headphones because of the price and the reviews. The sound quality lives up to the hype and the button functions are easy enough to learn (although I wish the large logo was not the hang up button). Unfortunately for me the bluetooth connection was choppy at times. I am fairly sure that it is not my phone because my bluetooth speakers work fine and have a decent range (both are Bose). The range is also not great but that has not been an issue for me as I work out with my phone in my pocket or nearby.

Best headphones for running I've ever had


Purchased these headphones a few months ago, and they worked great. In addition to testing their ipx rating in the shower, I had them on while running a marathon last month (the first hour of which was in the rain), and they made it through the finish with no problem. I did have an issue a couple weeks ago with one side of the headphones losing its outer case. But because I had registered the headphones on their website, resolving this issue was quick and painless. The customer service was responsive and understanding. Now all is good in my running world. I highly recommend these for anyone on the go. Great performance for your buck!

Decent, but not without issues


I purchased these to use at the gym, based on reviews and the sweat resistance.  The battery life is better than I expected and the sound is sufficient (bass is a bit boomy), but there are a few negatives:- When turning on, Bluetooth connectivity is not consistent. Sometimes it connects to my iPhone 7 and correctly identifies as a headset and shows the battery capacity, while others it needs to be connected, disconnected and re-connected again before it will work.- About half of the time, I have to manually select the headphones in the Music app or just wait 20-30 seconds. Several times, music just played from the iPhone speaker instead.  Bluetooth connectivity between my iPhone and other devices has been seamless.- The wire connecting them seems to be too long and is always something I'm conscious of.  It also constantly gets 'caught' when I turn my head and I have to take my hands off the treadmill's heartbeat sensors to adjust the wire, or one of the ear pods pops out of my ears. I tried the included wire cincher thing, but it just popped out of that when I turned my head - useless. Also the ear hooks are quite useless, as they have no rigidity - they're just rubbery and seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.- The only ear pieces that come with these that seem to really work for me are the spongy foam ones - all others seem to be too big and pop out...a problem I have never had with any other earbuds.  I do not use the foam ones because I use these at the gym and while on the treadmill, so I'm sweating a lot and I don't want that sweat soaking into the earbud tips and forming bacteria. Also, because the seal of the ear piece inside my ear is not tight, when sweat drips down, it gets inside my ear, which is quite gross.- Skipping a song on these is a different experience from all other headsets I've used.  Instead of knowing when you're listening to music and when you're using the phone (or just not listening to music), you have different buttons for skipping a song and redialing the last number.  Not remembering this, I double tapped the main button (like all other headsets) and it stopped the music and started calling someone.  To skip a song, you must hold down one of the volume keys...something that is not intuitive and will probably result in people adjusting the volume by accident instead. I just don't understand why they couldn't have kept a consistent behavior here.

Worked well for me for about 10-11 months.. Then the left ear-piece started to work intermittently, depending on how I was moving my head.

Pretty good sound, good value.  I would prefer if the over-the-ear hooks were adjustable, because it's a one-size fits all design, and they would stay in better if I could make a snug fit.

Before making my purchase I read other peoples reviews who also purchased the earbuds and kind of knew what I was getting into. At first glance you can tell they are cheaply made and will probably not last long. I remember seeing some photos other individuals posted showing the earbuds separating from the seems and mine look like they were about to separate as well. My main gripe about the earbuds is that the bluetooth signal in them SUCK!!! I usually put my phone in my left pocket when I workout at the gym and notice during my workout the audio was cutting in and out. I thought I need to charge the earbuds before I used them but then I remember I had them on the charger all night just to make sure they had full juice for the gym the next day. I started to diagnose the issue by cover the top of my phone and notice when I did that the audio to the earbuds would cut off totally. I've never experienced that issue with my other bluetooth earbuds made by Jabra, Beats by Dr Dre, Motorola, LG and Samsung. When I made the purchase for these earbuds I saw the original pricing was around $140 and was dropped down to $35. Now I know why the huge price drop and returned these the very next day and will stick with name brand earbuds

Great, affordable alternative to Powerbeats by Dre


I have Powerbeats3 by Dre and swear by them. I wanted to have a second set of buds as a back up, though, and not wanting to spend another $150, looked for a more affordable/budget option. Senso came back with a lot of positive reviews, so I gave them a try. While they are certainly not as comfortable as the Powerbeats and the sound will never reach the same rich quality, the Sensos are a really great bargain alternative! They sound better than the much, much more expensive Bose Soundsport or Jaybird x3, in my opinion. They are a bit uncomfortable and start to ache on my ears after about an hour...and they feel on the cheap end (material-wise). But small sacrifices to make for $30!

Actually I was more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of these earbuds. I purchased these for myself after Christmas as I had purchased very expensive buds for my sons, and knew I did not need Beats or Jaybirds for my needs. I really expected less due to the price.  Do not hesitate to purchase this item. Crisp clear balanced sound, very comfortable (I am a woman and I have small ears) the fit is good, super easy to pair with one or more of your devices. It took less than 5 minutes to pair to both my iphone and my ipad.  I have not received a call while wearing them, so I really cannot comment on the quality of the mic, the noise cancellation or ease of accepting calls. I do expect it to be equally as good as the sound quality.

Headphones are extremely easy to set up and use, paired right away with my LG V20. The sound quality is great and the earbuds are comfortable for me. It came in a nice case and has the usual stuff like replacement buds and what not nothing too surprising.The one thing that really stands out is the fact that SENSO contacted me through email stating that the headphones are covered by a one year warranty and if anything were to be an issue with them would be to contact them first. They seem very willing to go above and beyond for customer support which more than makes up for 5 stars. They seem like they genuinely care for their customers which is more than a lot of companies these days.

Great sound and value


The audio quality is very nice with these headphones.  There are a few drawbacks - the fit being number 1.  Compared to earbuds, these fit a bit less secure thus you lose a lot of the low end bass and if you are working out or wear them for an extended period of time (2 hrs +), your ears may feel a bit sore.  I'm not sure if you bought the ""name"" brand products you wouldn't have the same fit issues.Senso includes a carrying case, extra ear pieces and charging cable (which I love - dual platform is nice) making this a winner.For the price, these are fantastic.  I'm definitely pleased with the purchase.

These headphones used to be great when I bought a previous pair and those died on me after 3 years however, the most recent pair was awful. How in 3 years the product went from me giving them a 5 star rating to a 2 is sad and the reason is the battery life is awful, the headphones constantly switch my songs and couldnt handle me sweating on a 10 mile run.

Don't work in the water


I've had these headphones for several months now and bought them for swimming. The problem is when you go an inch under water the music shuts off so you can't listen to music uninterrupted. Also when talking most people can't understand me on the bluetooth so I have to switch over and hold the phone up to my ear which is highly annoying. Then on top of it I keep getting a beeping noise when I use them and it stops playing then starts again. I almost just want to throw them in the garbage. They're some of the worst headphones I've bought.

I had high hopes for these based on the ratings and reviews I read but about a month after I started using them the left earbud broke off... This despite using the carrying case! On closer inspection, the connection from the earpiece to the body is fairly flimsy. I should have known when they were supposedly marked down from $170 to $39 that there was a reason why.They also didn't pair well with my iphone 6s plus and I would frequently have to disconnect and reconnect to get sound. I'd return them except now I'm outside the thirty day window :( My advice? Don't be fooled by the ranking or the huge markdown. These earbuds are not built to last.

Effective, comfortable, great price


Compact, comfortable, recharge well, nice carrying case, seem to be durable. Not the best sound quality, but I’m liking these Bluetooth headphones at their price point. Gym once a day for 2 or so hours and they stay charged for about 3-4 days.Two issues:The small flap that covers the USB plug can pop open when working out.Bluetooth can disconnect at the gym sometimes - I think this is occurring due to another Bluetooth headset out there conflicting with this one.

I wish there could be a 4.5 rate.  Everything works perfect in this headphones for a very affordable price. Nice package, very easy to be paired, volume very good, only thing that didn't let me give it 5 stars was that there were rust stain in the micro USB cable.

Nice sound quality, could have better bass / lower frequency. Fit was good, definitely stays put while actively moving during workouts. I sweat heavily so sweat proof worked. If you noticed, I'm writing in past tense. Sound on left side is gone, internal wiring seems weak. I didn't do anything to fray it, I'm calling it wear and tear. Only lasted 8 months.

2nd pair - stops working after a year.


Update: this is my second pair. Using with iPhoneX now. My first pair just stopped working. I thought it was a fluke because I left it plugged in to charge for a long stretch of time. This pair also just stopped working out of the blue. Won’t charge or turn on.Former review: Works great aside from very occasional interruptions in sound. Used with iPhone 6s. Sometimes when turning it on it wouldn't run sound through the headphones automatically. I'd have to go to Bluetooth settings, disconnect and reconnect.

Constantly Disconnect


I wish I could write a good review but I can’t. I went through two pairs with the same issues. First is an incessant beeping, one beep about every ten seconds. The issue seems to be with the Bluetooth connection with my IPhone. I could have lived with that for a $20 product, but more important is that they constantly disconnect and turn off. This can happen after a couple of minutes of use, making them useless. Th3 company was good about replacing the first pair but I won’t bother with pair number two. I will look for something better.

These headphones are the best. They offer good sound quality, can be loud, and fit comfortably, but most importantly they are durable and the company is very responsive and helpful all for 30$. This is my second pair because I love them so much, and the most recent ones I unfortunately lost. I use them daily for working out and walking to places (being on a college campus). When my first pair gave out after 8 months, the company sent me a replacement thanks to the warranty within 3 days of me emailing them.

These work great but depending on the device you may experience jitter and connectivity issues.  The jitter usually happens when using it along with another app that uses wifi or gps like a run tracker.  Also the pairing can be iffy but nothing that isn't easily troubleshooted and fixed with a reset or power cycle.

Really good deal


I have struggled with the Bluetooth wireless earbud conundrum for some time. I have paid way too much money for Jaybirds and Bose and neither of them are worth the money in my opinion. I bought these not expecting too much but having had them for a few weeks, I can say the volume quality far surpasses my predictions. Can’t yet comment on battery life because I haven’t used them often enough. These are very comfortable and stay in my ears better than either of the aforementioned styles.

Finally! Wireless buds that get LOUD!!!


I like it loud without compromising on sound quality. I've tried JBL, Beats, and Plantronics, all to my disappointment. They just wouldn't get loud enough for me. These were not only plenty loud at 80% volume, but I had to go into my iPhone settings and adjust the EQ to my taste because there was too much bass!The signal is slightly compressed, but not to the point of annoyance. I haven't heard any distortion yet (Probably thanks to that little bit of compression.) Frequency response is good. Harmonic distortion is a little better than normal for earbuds. (At high volumes, you can't really escape those detuned low notes, without going to big over ear phones with desicated low-end drivers.) Very impressed, especially at this price.

Love these headphones. Great bang for the buck! Had another pair for over a year, sadly my kids got a hold of them and ripped them apart in an effort to brown-nose their mother.

The sound quality is very good and the battery works for a long time, but it is impossible to un-kink the strap after you take them out of the box- it is also a little too long and can get caught in your shirt/ponytail.

I bought these to wear while working out and shooting baskets at the gym. The earpiece material is flexible and does not slip off the ears.

Not for outdoor running. Otherwise ok.


I bought these as my first foray into wireless headphones. These are very light weight and despite the piece that wraps around your ear seeming flimsy, it stays in while running. But these are not for running at all. I wanted to test these outside to see how they performed. Inside they were just fine. Outside they were useless. I ignored another review about wind noise, but they were not kidding. Running in a gentle 5 mile an hour breeze sounds like you're in a wind tunnel, so I took them out immediately and went back to my wired pair. Additionally, the placement of the buttons on the earpiece itself makes changing settings mid-run a bit more awkward than the buttons being on the cord. They do tend to stick out pretty far but if you're at your desk at work, these are perfectly fine for music. Songs get choppy when the battery is low but recharging is easy and the buttons work great overall. The TLDR, good indoors, bad outdoors.

Low Price/High Quality!!!


I looked at reviews before purchasing these earbuds...they were ranked the best of the lower priced ones. I absolutely LOVE them!!  I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg but still wants good sound!!  They are comfortable and easy to use!!!  I will tell everyone I know that they are AWESOME!!!!!

Worth the money


These are great!!! Normally it is hard for gummy ear buds to stay in my ear because mine are so small, but the guy great. I wear these at work all day and then go to the gym afterwards. I have worn them on the elliptical and lifting weights in the gym. They never fall off which is amazing when you drag yourself to the gym and need music to keep you motivated. These are a great buy and battery life is great.

Stopped working at 7 months, replacement on the way


They worked pretty well for 7 months.  Stopped working today.  Called to get another pair since within one year of buying.  They are sending a replacement.  Sadly, the warranty on the new pair will only be until November of this year, one year from the original purchase.  Is that weird?

Bought these headphones for my husband who's a truck driver. He really likes them. They're loud, clear and noise cancelling. Great product for the price.

Terrible for running


These are horrible for running. No matter which earbud size I used, the right side (with all the controls) would fall out 10+ times on a 20 min run. The piece that goes over the ear is way too tall and not adjustable. It just bounced against my head constantly. And if you go to adjust the earbuds as they are constantly falling out, it was impossible to do so without pausing/adjusting the sound. Don’t buy this if you are looking for something for running.

Great bass performance and spot on fit


I  picked these up a few days ago and am impressed by the sound quality.  First off the bass is excellent.  I've actually had to turn it down with my phone's EQ.  My first impression was it's a perfect fit.  They are light weight and I  don't even feel them when working out.  They charged up quickly and easily with the supplied USB cable.  I can't say anything about battery life yet but will give this review an update after I've cycled thru them a few times.I highly recommend taking a look at these wireless/Bluetooth ear buds if your in the market.  They even come with a cool little case to store them in when they aren't being used.

Great sound, horrible microphone


Despite what is advertised, there is no noise cancellation for the microphone, so the other end of the call can hear EVERYTHING. If you're only using these to listen to music, they're fantastic, but forget trying to make phone calls with them. I'm giving them 3 stars because the accessories are great and the sound quality for the wearer is wonderful, but the lack of microphone noise filtering is a deal breaker.

Sound quality is excellent. Battery life is at least 10hrs of constant music streaming. Connection to my IPHONE 8plus was simple.

Bought these and a different brand of Bluetooth wireless earphones called “let’s fit”. About the same price each. There were mixed reviews for both. But I for sure love this brand. You just have to adjust the sound through your phone for your liking. You can adjust the over the ear piece as well which I like about this brand. And they’re comfortable. They’re a little heavy for my liking. But over all sound and style I love them. And they charge super fast and they stay charged. Very nice.

For the price, best wireless headphones available.  A minimal charge for 6+ hours of use.**Update -  Mine somehow developed a slight wear in the rubber on one side & the play quality was affected, even though this pair is surprisingly well-made (in a world of sub-par products)  The company was very graceful and promptly sent me a replacement pair.  The top-tier customer service is much appreciated, and I recommend these to any friends & family looking for bluetooth headphones.

Paired easily. Like on/off/pause on outside of earpiece. Some headphones have buttons too close together, causing you to turn off or increase volume when that wasn’t what you intended. Sound quality is decent for a relatively inexpensive headphone. Headphones are comfortable too.

The best running headphones for your buck!!


Life-changing! These earbuds work perfectly and sound better. Super easy to set up and use daily. I can run without ever having to worry about these falling out or becoming loose at all. They are snug and comfortable (even when sweaty.) I was really surprised with the long battery life (I've used them for many hours and haven't had To charge yet.) and extensive connection. I can use these at like a 20 foot radius before the Bluetooth connection gets sketchy. It's pretty amazing. My boyfriend recently bought a different brand of Bluetooth headphones for 3 times the price and he has to take them back b cause they hardly work when his phone is in his pocket. Overall an incredible value. You won't be disappointed.

Superb quality sound and build for a remarkably low price


These are really well made. You can tell a lot of quality and thought went into these. Right down to the packaging. Even the box was well thought out and sturdy. Has a pull-out drawer design with a cloth tab to open it with ease.. It even smells nice. Right down to the clip ties, which there are two of seem well designed and easy to use.  Plenty of extra ear pieces of different sizes, car adapter, and a charging cable for both regular android devices and for iPhones. The battery lasts quiet a long time and charged rather quickly out of the box. About 2 hours. But they had some charge already in them. Once you get a feel for the controls which are located on the right ear piece it's quite easy to use. The mic works well. Friends say they can hear me loud and clear and I can here them loud and clear as well.  the ear pieces go in rather easy and when in they stay put tightly due to the over ear design really helps. So what about the sound? It's got a nice smooth lower end, but these do not delver deep punchy bass. Just a nice smooth lower end, enough bass to be sufficient for most users. But music that relies on a lot of bass response like Hip Hop or anything with dancey beats. This will not be for these kinds of music . Mids are very smooth and the higher registers are quite crisp and clean. You can tell the sound is very good. It doesn't sound in any way cheap, but take into account the limitations involved here. These are tiny little speakers. They don't sound quite as pleasing as my ear cup JVC headphones which can handle a lot more bass and a little more high end. Those JVC's are not that expensive but they do sound better than many sets of headphones I have used. My dad has some $200 Bose headphones that do not sound as good as these Senso's or the JVC's. I think a lot depends on taste if you will like these more or less than I do. Also when one is used to one kind of sound and earphones it can take time to adjust to another. My only gripe is people described these as being able to get really loud. With the volume all the way up on my Samsung smart phone, they do give plenty of volume, but not quite as loud as a cheap $25 set of wired earphones I did use before I got these. All in all though these sound very good, they are clearly made well and even the carry case is not only attractive but built solid with a circular design and zipper function. I don't know much about Senso, but if they keep making excellent quality products like this and are able to sell them at bulk at and very deep discount, I think they could be one of the better makers of reasonably priced high quality listening devices out there. Very impressed thus far for certain.

They are functional and the sound quality awesome!


Straight out of the box, these fit perfectly into my small ears, but I still have to have my hooks for security. I like how they come fully equipped with all of these accessories! As far as noise cancellation, you're going to have to turn them up a little bit for outside noise to be completely negated, but even with the volume down, outside noise is very faint. I've had them for a few weeks now, and I love them. You just pop them in and go!

I was hoping for better sound quality like with the Blayz earbuds which look very similar to these.  Apparently Blayz has higher quality so I'll stick to that brand.  I just broke my Blayz earbuds when these finally die.  They are okay for talking on the phone though, don't get me wrong.

Same Product, Different Package


I ordered this because it was well rated and my Bluephonic wireless earphones broke. The add ons were a plus but I didn’t receive what was pictured. Instead of another cable and a car charger, I received a magnetic car mount and a phone card sleeve. I don’t know how to feel about these since I have a pop socket on my phone but it wasn’t what I ordered. As for the headphones themselves, they’re just a clone of the old Bluephonics earbuds I had before. Literally identical in buttons, button controls, and the voice that says “Power On” and “Power Off”. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing because I liked my bluephonics but I was expecting a new product, not a clone.

Flimsy rubber earpieces that fall off.


Flimsy rubber earpiece that refuses to stay on my ear. I put it on and standing still, the rubber piece (especially on my left ear) slowly slides off and drops, rendering these useless. In conversation with a  former client of mine of my frustration in finding quality sport headphones for training, he actually pulled out this product commending it. I'm only 5'8'' 180. My client is about 5'5' 140 and in his late 60's. The difference between us? His ears were like dumbo's on his head. He had large ears. I don't.

Great pair of earbuds for the price, worked well for almost a year, connected to just about any devices I wanted. Battery life was ok, not amazing or anything but they did last a good amount of time. Almost never a problem with falling out or off my ears, stayed well and didn't ache or anything after long periods of time. The wire connecting the 2 earbuds together began to tear away about a month ago and has slowly went since. Now only one side works. Great buy until now, if I get a new pair like the description says I will move the rating up but until then, staying at a 3.

I am still trying these out and so far I am confused. Confused as to why pay $80+ For other Bluetooth headphones. I have a another expensive pair and from a sound quality and fit perspective these are just as good but are so much cheaper. I go running with these and they do reduce outside noise so you have to take note of that. Otherwise I really like these. They are light and I barely notice they are there. Easy to sync and they have the same functionality as my plantronics but are actually more immersive and have a deeper base which may be a good or bad thing depending on what you use them for. Build quality is great. I will check back in another month or so.

COMFORTABLY WORTH THE MONEY.


This was a very tough choice for me being that so many of the ear bud designs look familiar. I had originally bought the Otium buds and was very pleased although reading through the reviews I discovered that many of them were dying out just shortly after a month. After a few days of contemplation I decided to return them in fear of losing out in a short period of time. I then came across Senso and a couple of other brands, ultimately deciding to try out the Sensos. After only a couple days I am pleased to have a pair. They seem well built (for the price range) and I have no worries about them breaking down anytime soon. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a quality headset at an affordable price.

Short lived


I have used these semi-regularly for about four months. For the first three months, they worked very well for me. Over the last month, however, they have had some issues. The battery life has seemingly plummeted. After I fully charge them, I will go to use them, and within minutes they start beeping in my ear while my music/podcast cuts out. This happens whether I begin to use them immediately after they are fully charged or several hours after they have fully charged (e.g. if I charge them in the evening and don't use them until the morning). I never know if they're going to work for more than three minutes.

none of them fit comfortably. Even the smallest size one keepst falling out ...


I bought these to wear at the gym. I have absolutely no issue with the sound quality of these headphones, but be advised, they are not noise cancelling (not a dealbreaker for me). The reason I'm rating these low is that they are enormous. Despite coming with 3 different size earpiece covers, none of them fit comfortably. Even the smallest size one keepst falling out of my ears. The hooks that go over the ears are also worthless, as they do not fit snugly, and as soon as I start walking/running they slip right off. I was able to make them work somewhat by tucking the hooks underneath a headband, but this was not particularly comfortable.

Cheap electronics. I ordered the Active Buds 250 and 255 the next version of these earphones.

This is ridiculous because the other reviews I read stated how they are reliable and durable.

Awesome sound! Very comfortable


Awesome sound! Very comfortable. Paired very quickly.  Many reviewers mentioned a heavy bass response.  I didn't notice it so much.  Smooth sound with nice dimension. Not harsh. So much better than my previous wireless headphones.  Noise cancelling is not quite as as effective as I thought it would be but I've never really heard a pair of noise cancelling headphones before so have nothing to compare it to. This however is not a major problem for me. I would recommend these headphones to friends.  Very happy with my purchase.

Not quality headphones


These Bluetooth headphones were great when I got them in Feb. But two months later (today) and using them the same way I always use them (for running) they just died. I thought first they were just out of charge, but I had just taken them off the charger this morning. I put them on the charger when I got home and no light came on and I tried switching the outlet and nothing worked. I'm outside the return window, but I'm not recommending these headphones because two months lifespan isn't worth the purchase price!

Poor Quality


I bought two of these for me and my wife, but both did not stay in our ear so good when running.  We tried all of the different ear tips but none helped. The sound quality has no base, only mids and highs.  I wouldn't buy or recommend,  spend your money on a different one.

I was soooo excited when I received these.  The sound is great.  the control is easy to access while working out. there was some skipping but I just adjusted.  my huge disappointment is that the ear hooks or whatever they are called did not hold their shape.  They became really loose so the headphones started slipping out of my ears until it was just pointless to even have them in.  Lord knows, I do not exercise enough to have worn them out as I only got around 15 uses before I started having this problem.  As I said, I REALLY wanted to like them.

After a few months of regular use, the left earbud on the Senso headphones stopped working. When I sought support, the company told me to factory reset them. When that did not work, they stopped communication and did not fulfill their warranty.

Normally I just read reviews good and bad both then decide on purchasing. Quick and to point review. Very impressed with these ear buds. First impressions. From the Sensor box they come in to laminated instructions and quality of the ear buds get A++. Plenty of charging options and replacement ear pods included. Nice caring case. Easy to pair with no issues. Sound quality of bass and trebile is excellent. Sound turned half way up and they jam. If they stand the test of time I will be fully impressed. Battery life I haven't tested so can't speak to that. Would I purchase again. Heck yes.

Very comfortable, sound seems somewhat muted, but that's compared to my bose soundsports so maybe that isn't fair.  Although the ear fins aren't very supported, it doesn't seem to make a difference in how secure they feel on your ear during workouts.

I don’t know where all the 5-Star reviews for these headphones are coming from because these are garbage. The Bluetooth receiver is too weak to pick up a signal from my phone in my back pocket! Even after a full charge and resetting the Bluetooth connection they still cut out if the phone gets more than 12” away from the right ear bud (where the receiver is). These are garbage and I returned them immediately.

Nice while it lasted. UPDATE: received new pair at no cost


Product came in a timely manner. Headphones fit comfortably and didn't fall out like other ones I have used. Charging cord was also a nice addition that I didn't expect. However, the headphones only worked for 3 months before they stopped charging. It would be worth it to pay more money for a product that will last longer. Do not buy!Update:Contacted customer service and received a new pair of headphones since they have a one year warranty. Customer service representative responded quickly and the replacement headphones arrived 2 days after I sent my address. However, the piece that goes over the ears on the new headphones is not as comfortable or as flexible as the one on my original pair. This tells me that there are inconsistencies in the products that they sell.

The sound quality is good, the noise canceling is better than I actually want, and the battery life is impressive.

They're a little too loud when I'm in a moderately quite building on the lowest volume setting.2) They look ridiculous.3) They didn't make it through the washer and dryer, sadly. I had them for less than a month and put them through the washer/dryer. Only one side works and the volume is seriously reduced on it.

It makes it nice being able to not worry about my phone and just listen to music. You can pause, forward, repeat and control the volume. I am on call and it allows me to answer the calls while I'm still working out.The volume is great. I had another similar set and the volume was no where as good as these. I have even used them mowing my lawn. The waterproof rating is excellent and the case is great for storage.Battery life is better than normal and I only have to charge them every couple days.

After accidentally (okay fine...and continuously) ripping my traditional headphones out of my ears at the gym, I knew I needed a different option.  The Senso headphones arrived quickly, charged quickly, and could not be easier to use.  And...they sound great!  I would definitely buy these again. So...as you look at other products and try to find your best option, know that these are a good choice.

I ordered these for my husband.  He likes to take his music with him when he goes hiking and the headphones he was using just didn't have any staying power.  I bought these based on the long review done by Cubichi on January 8, 2017.  Cubichi mentioned that the headphones were sweat proof which was an important consideration as my husband runs much of his hike.  My husband says these work very well and the sound is great. The price is reasonable and I signed up for the 30 day free trial of Prime so that the headphones would arrive in time for my husband's birthday.

This product delivers what manufacturer claims!


Everything the manufacturer advertised proved itself to be good quality. The bass was without a doubt the best I have ever experienced on portable head phones. Amazon rated this manufacturer one of the best products with over 30% fewer returns over other comparable brands in it's class.

Great sound and easy to use


I have had these earbuds for a few days.  I was pleased with all of the accessories that came with them  They sinked to my I-Phone instantly and the battery seems to last and last.  I fly for work a lot and am excited to use these during my trips.  The one year warranty is great.  I hope not to use it, but a nice plan to have.  They are comfortable on my ears and the buttons are easy to get to.  I had been shopping for a pair of buds for a long time and reading the other comments made these SENSO Earbuds an easy choice.

Good but not great


These are good for working out in the gym. Sound quality is good and so is the battery life. My only complaint is that when the battery gets down to 30% they automatically shut off, which is super annoying since they still have battery life. Compared to beats and stuff, these are an awesome deal for the price.

Small Issue


For the price, these headphones are really good. They obviously go around your ears so they don’t fall out unless you start violently shaking your head so they’re good for gym use. My one issue with them is that they keep saying “battery low” and turning down your volume when they start to get low. I understand if they do it once or twice but they interrupt each song like 4-5 times and that’s pretty annoying. Get rid of that feature or just always keep your battery high and you’ll be all set.

Sound is not great, but everything else is


Let's just say these earbuds are great if you want two sub-woofers directly in your ear. For rock and alternative music, they sound tinny and very bassy. I've never had to use the equalizer on my phone, but I had to turn the 60 Hz frequency all the way down around -8 dB to get a normal amount of bass and increase other frequencies.With that out of the way, the headphones powered up and paired with my phone in just a few seconds. Fit is comfortable and the wire isn't intrusive. I wish there was a way to tighten the wrap around my ears, but they'll keep them on my head in the case that they fell out of my ear. They have a good weight and design.The extras weren't necessary, but look high quality. I don't have a micro-USB or Lightning compatible device (I have USB-C), but the cable looks very nice and allows you to switch between the two (micro-USB and Lightning). Haven't used the car charger but it looks nice; I already have a good one but I'm sure a friend will snatch these up. The case for the headphones are good quality with a nice faux carbon fiber look - great if you want to take them in a bag or backpack.All in all, these headphones are great if you want to take your music with you, but don't expect great sound.Update: The sound is actually decent if you heavily modify it with an equalizer, though not many people know to do this. Not sure if all apps and phones have one, but if you have Android and Google Play Music, you're good to go. Not entirely sure if I believe any of the reviews on this product - be aware.

Not for exercise


The quality of this product and packaging was impressive.  Pairing and sound was very good.  However; the ear loops do not hold the headphones in place.  I certainly could not exercise with them on without having to push them back in place.  I would suggest the manufacturer add more rigidity to the ear loops.

Not water proof. The noise cancellation interferes when you move your head around ! What's worse is that it cover falls easily which caused the volume rocker to be lost.

Overall the sound quality is there and if you use the included job site earplugs, you will see monster base yet still good quality. I would buy these again and recommend to a friend. Not without its flaws, but for the price, I would buy them again they are such a good deal.

Worked fine for several months, then rapidly quit


Wanted to give these earbuds several months before reviewing, so here goes:They worked great until about 6 months in, when the sound on the left earbud began cracking and distorting. I lived with that for a week or so until the earbuds quit on me entirely. They’ll power on but don’t appear to be holding a charge whatsoever. The earbuds indicate they are fully charged when I plug them in, but they power down almost immediately when I attempt to use them.I cannot recommend this product and am disappointed.

Don't buy if you like your hearing


Headphones are of good quality, but if you're using an Apple device, don't bother. Even at the minimum volume setting, they are WAY too loud. Trying to adjust the volume from either my phone or the earbuds didn't do anything. I tried calling Tekatron support and they were of little to no help. Their only suggestions was to reboot the device and download an equalizer. So I did- The equalizer only helps if you are using music stored in the Apple music app. If you're using a streaming service such as Amazon music, Pandora, or Spotify, forget about it. Returning for a refund to buy earbuds in person that won't destroy my hearing.

Hi rating bc sound is great except for certain songs with rich mid range sound that this set of headphones distorts. There are very little if any connection issues while running/ cycling, Microphone is spotty, really dependant on your surroundings. Deep base, great overall function, ear sizes and memory foam pad are everything you need and as for Beats, they look identical and I wouldn't spend the money on anything mid level, I would stick to these and go with Bose sound sports or ANY of the new tech they are just starting to really turn out with these wireless headset competitors.

Customer Service will take care of you


I absolutely love these headphones! I've been using these headphones nearly every other day for work, commute, working. The headphones stopped working one day and I reached out to Tekatron's customer support for assistance. After a few emails back and forth trying to troubleshoot the issue, Tekatron warrantied my headphones! Customer service made the process very easy and straight forward. The headphones are great for what I use them for and knowing that customer service stands behind their product makes me feel confident about the products and the company behind them.

Thoroughly Impressed


As you can probably tell from the title of this review I am impressed with my purchase. Aside from the amount of accessories that this product came with the headphones in cells are very lightweight and easy to wear. Pairing was easy and the sound quality is impressive given the connection. I have already recommended this product to a number of my friends and coworkers.

Best blue tooth headphone purchase I have made

Wow these things look great.  After wearing them for a couple days I can now review them.  They are so comfy and cancel out all the loud noise from working in a factory.  The sound quality is amazing with music and even sounds great listening to an audio book.  Not even sure how this is possible for $35.  It even comes with 2 charging cables and a car charger.  Amazing.

Don't hesitate if you're looking for a good pair of headphones at a great price!


I don't generally leave reviews but felt this product is worth raving about. Just received them tonight, took a few minutes to fully charge, and hooking to your phone is flawlessly simple (most bluetooth is). Once they're on your ears you can hardly tell you're even wearing headphones. The sound quality is actually pretty fantastic and they get PLENTY loud and I'm known for loving music loud. I actually cancelled my KANOA headphone order which is totally wireless in order to try these out, I think even though there is a wire that will make them harder to lose or only wear one if you're trying to listen to someone. Absolutely would recommend!

Decent but in the end disappointed


I had this product since May '17 and I am a adventure racer.  I sweat a lot and these did well with that.  I was disappointed with the product for a few reasons, 1. the battery life did not last as long as what I would like,  2. they cut out a lot throughout the time I had them especially when the battery was running low, and 3. This past weekend I went to pull them from the factory charger and the charger end along with the mini-usb slot on the earbud was melted.  I do not feel safe using this device any longer so now I am on the hunt for a new set.

Received the product quickly. It was easy to pair and start using. I listen mostly to books so I don't focus on sound quality but for my purpose the sound was clear and clean.

It worked well for me for about a month after I purchased it. Now every time I try to charge the headphones it simply wont charge. It has to be a problem with the charging port since I can still turn them on but cant charge them. I refuse to use them right now since they are at low battery and I want proof to back up my claim.UPDATE:I figured out the issue and its that it is still charging but the light indicator is out of sync and will re-sync eventually!

SOUND WILL BLOW YOU AWAY


Was not expecting this quality from $30 head phones. The ergonomics are great. With multiple options on earbud size, you wont have problems finding a perfect in ear fit; with the exterior, even shaking violently doesn't make em move a fraction of an inch. Volume is superb as well as quality. Only problem i have is flat wire connecting the toe, makes for a more difficult low-profile on the ""rat tail"" when utilizing the wire tie- hardly a pressing issue though. Lastly, the easy of use on the buttons makes managing volume and phone calls an absolute breeze.Overall: excellent product and worth the investment!

The caveat to this review is I just received them so this only an initial review.  The buds have a good sound and functionality of the buds is simple.They are comfortable and having different ear pieces this is a good thing.

I am torn on these headphones. The price is great. They appear to be made of cheap materials but they have held up well to my workouts. Battery life hasn't been an issue at all. My issue is with the sound. I haven't used them in a long time but I think in terms of sound they are comparable to a cheap $10 of wired earbuds. At louder volumes the sound of music is poor and there is a slight tin to it. Good for the price but I can't say these headphones could even remotely compare to even a slightly higher end model

Audio quality sounds great for the price


After having initial issues with the quality of the audio, I was instructed by a customer service representative at SENSO to do a factory reset on my earphones. When I first started using these headphones, the quality of the audio was very muffled at distant; however, after performing a factory reset, this completely solved the issue. Audio quality sounds great for the price, and these headphones do their job perfectly for when I'm working out at the gym. My only gripe with these headphones is in regard to the volume adjustment. The lower/raise volume buttons appeared to be in a reversed order that I'm normally accustomed to, but it's nothing that substantially hurts the quality of the earphones. Overall, for the price, this was a good purchase that satisfied my need for a pair of Bluetooth headphones.

Good value


Headphones worked well for a long period of time. Not the most comfortable, but very good buy for the price! I didn't really get a chance to use the mic, but these headphones were mainly used for long distance running/training. They are a good set of headphones to beat up at the gym or during workouts.

great alternative to iphone headsets


a lot of my prior headsets became useless (not useless, but harder to connect due to the need of an adaptor), so finding an alternative solution to get headphones connected FAST became a priority. i use this at work to make calls/listen to music and it's been working out great!

Great quality, nice range, good sound. Very satisfied.


Love these. Very nice quality.  They work quite a good distance from my phone. Easy pause ability by pushing large button on right ear. Volume controls also available on top of right earbud.  No issues at all. Quite comfortable. I use them mostly to stream The Tom Leykis Show every afternoon, but music quality is good too.

Great Value, Great Performance. Buy These.


I was happily surprised by these headphones. Given the price, I admit I was a bit skeptical. I had purchased the Plantronics Backbeat Fit and was extremely disappointed in those. They were an expensive lesson in unmet promises.However, the Senso headphones were a different story entirely. They fit perfectly, and they really do cancel out ambient noise. That's important for me because my gym tends to blare music that really isn't my taste. These really blocked out that music and let me listen to what I love. But the feature of these I really appreciate is the volume. I listen to a lot of classical and musicals while I work out. (Some people think it's weird, I know.) I love that even my older music that was transferred from analog is completely clear, and at only half the volume. Older music may have to be turned up a little over that, but not much.The phone part works, too, extremely well.One thing you'll want to note is that when it says the battery is low, it will warn you three times before it shuts off, so they mean it. These are easy enough to charge, however. Just check them before an extended workout, and you won't be disappointed.I was impressed by the amount of stuff in the box--cables, plug for charging, etc.Bluetooth connection was about as easy as it gets. And the one time I had a problem, it was with my iPhone. Turning that off and back on again solved it in a moment.Truly an excellent choice for working out, which is what I bought them for. Sorry I didn't find these sooner!

Great earbuds that stay in place well


Use these at the gym and have been really happy with the fit and durability. I even closed one bud in my car door and still haven't had a problem. They sync up easily and have a pretty long battery life, and most importantly, I don't have to mess with them a hundred times while working out. They sound good enough, no issues there either.

Make sure you don't lose them!


Great for it's price, my only gripe and this applies to all wireless earbuds, there is no clip to catch the buds so you don't accidentally lose them. Whenever I am busy or tires from the gym I forget them and misplace them. If you are using one ear to listen to music the weight of the earpiece will drop and slowly slide off your ear so be careful. Otherwise it's good, especially for it's price.

I basically paid $30 for Beats


Holy Guacomole!! Let me find out I paid $30 for some Beats. I set the bar really low because of the price. Not only were these easy to pair, but the sound quality is fantastic; and not from a lower price perspective. They truly sound like the several pairs of wireless Beats I owned. The range is also great. I was able to listen to my music with my phone in my living room and me in my bedroom about 10 - 12 ft away. So far the battery life is true to description as I have yet to recharge them and I've been using them at least an hour a day for the past week.I plan on getting several more pairs just in case the shelf life on these things are short. Either way, it was well worth the money spent.

Doesn't Do It For Me


These are probably the most expensive Bluetooth headphones I've purchased and also the worst. The left ear bud does not stay in place, so when I'm running it constantly falls out of my ear. If the earpiece that goes around your ear were flexible and were able to be bent into a specific shape (i.e., the shape of my ear) these would be great. But unfortunately, they do not. I do not love these and I would highly recommend another bluetooth headphone product and/or brand.

a style to consder, read this edited May 15


Please note this. I purchased and reviewed these. Like many, I wonder how reliable is the label of sweat proof, waterproof, water resistant on items. I have used sweat proof ear phones that shorted out in a fog. Watches that died in a heavy sweat. Where these exceed the label in my opinion. I used, charged and placed these earphones in their container. Somehow container and contents ended up in dirty clothes. Were washed in front loading  machine on regular with extra rinse. I checked them and USB cover was still in place. I placed them on counter to air dry for a few hours. Charge was still present and I used them for a few hours. Now three days and 18 hours of use later they still work perfectly. Most comfortable sweatproof earphones I've tried. I have a problem with ear buds because they don't stay in place. Earphones that stay on with pressure leave sores in my ears. I don't like to use headphone style outside because they block too much surrounding noise. I kept looking for something that would work. I saw these and decided to give them a try. I love the way they clip around ear. There is no heavy pressure on my ears. The sound is excellent. I only need 30-40% sound. That's good even with a lot of surrounding noise. I can easily keep one bud out of ear to keep aware of surrounding noise when walking outside. They did run easily for nearly 9 hours. I had no trouble connecting to kindle fire 3rd and 8 generation as well as 4 year old iPod touch, and new iPod touch. I haven't used it with LG phone only connected it. I am rating this a 4 because I need to check durability.

Love the fit, love the sound, love the customer service.  I cannot say enough about their quality and customer service.  They emailed me the day I received them  just to see if I was satisfied.  I had a small issue with the pair I ordered.  They worked with me and gave me troubleshooting guidance.  WHen that didn't work they immediately replaced them.  I have used them jogging and lifting weights and couldn't be more happy.  They fit perfectly and come with multiple options of ear bud sizes.  They even came witha short micro USB charger and another longer charging cable that charges both micro USB and lightning.  In addition a double USB car charger and a carrying case!!!!  Kudos to this company!

Great headphones. I like the over the ear design. Before these, I purchased wireless headphones that hook into (not over) your ear and these are much better. Much more stable and they never fall out. Plenty of ear bud size options, even ones made out of ear plug material so they really form to your ears nicely. Sound is good. Great deal.

Better than Beats by Dre!


A great product that came at an amazing price! I have been an advocate of Beats by Dre for over the years, so much that I've bought (3) sets of ear bud headphones. However, after giving SENSO Bluetooth Headphones a chance, I don't know what I've been doing for the past few years!! They have an amazing sound quality, superb noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit! I haven't owned them for too long, so I can't say yet whether or not they live up to their sweat-proof ability, but so far so good! I give them 5 out of 5 stars, hands down! and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy any type of wireless headphones. Not to mention, that although the distance says 30ft, I accidentally left my iPod across the gym from me yesterday, and still maintained connectivity! You can't beat that!

High quality bluetooth earbuds at a dollar store price


I've only had these headphones for a few days, but so far they are great. The battery life is good, the sound quality is on par with headphones that cost 3-4x as much, they are nice and lightweight, and they stay put during my workouts. Granted, I'm not doing anything high-speed or with a lot of fast movement, but for regular lifting and cycling, these are fantastic.I have no complaints so far, and I am impressed with the service Sendo provided. I got an email from them with a customer service phone number which most e-commerce or drop shipping companies these days don't have. I have no doubt that if these break Senso will replace them or refund my money, but hopefully I won't have to worry about that.

Decent but wont last


For an inexpensive pair of headphones they are decent. I used mine at the gym and mowing the yard only. Best thing I can say about these is they stay in place. There is no bass or noise canceling at all. After 6 months of use, I could only Bluetooth pair with one device, tried with different devices and would get a connected notification but no music playback. Now, a year out they do not work at all, can not turn on. If you do not mind replacing every year go for it, just do not expect quality.

Sound competes with top end earphones - UPDATE: downgraded 1 star


UPDATE:1/9/18I bought another pair (my 3rd) for my wife to use in the gym. They arrived and I find that this unit has a very poorly made USB port cover which is much smaller and flimsy compared to my earlier pairs. It's almost impossible to open the port door with your fingernail and given the force required this door will tear away soon exposing the port to damage. I contacted the company and they made an unclear statement about a design update (hmmm, updates usually improve a product) and suggested I send the headphones back to Amazon for a refund. Not terribly helpful, could have figured that out on my own...expected the company to make it right.Anyway, I'm a bit disappointed...there may be a reduction in quality with these newly designed models. I've reduced my rating to 4 stars.ORIGINAL POST:I have a pair of Klipsch as well as a pair of Bose earphones I use. I paid more than 3 times as much for the Bose then l paid for this SENSO brand. The sound on these SENSO's compares favorably to both the Klipsch and Bose.At this price point including all that comes in the box, this is an outstanding value.Bass response  is often weak in ear buds especially in the sub $50 range. Not these, quite frankly at times the bass is almost too much and it can muddy up the sound...overwhelming mid and higher ranges when listening to a song with a heavy bass track.  I find if I reposition them not so deeply into my ear the separation of the sound improves.I can easily recommend these little workhorses, you won't be disappointed.

Good, but not great.


I was deciding between these and the Skullcandy bluetooth earbuds. I went with these because they seemed lighter and more practical for my activities while wearing headphones/earbuds. Also the price was a bit cheaper. I really like Skullcandy, but looking at a majority 5 star rating with these versus the 3 to 4 star on the Skullcandy's, I went with the previous reviews and bought the SENSO earbuds. Thus far I have had no issues with these headphones. They are very loud and connect to my Samsung Galaxy S4 very quickly (and easily). The sound quality is good and they seem to be somewhat durable. My lack of a star (from 5 stars) is due to the ""active"" portion of the sale. Whilst you can be active with these headphones, it is not ideal. I ran with them in/on and there was a lot of wind noise. I'm not upset about it, but for the asking price on these (originally $100+)...yeah... So all in all, I should have gone with some good over-ear headphones. Yes, they are bulky and somewhat obnoxious, but I would not have had to worry about wind noise while running. Also...all of the ""they never fall out of my ears - it's so wonderful"" reviews...must be nice. Unfortunately for me, they can fall out of my ears with a small amount of force. In other words, I won't be doing jumping jacks with them in. I did light jumping to test that bit of it and they technically stayed on my ear, but the buds wiggled out. If you're not hurting financially, you may want to consider these. May God bless you all.

They're nice headphones in the way they sound and fit, but have a few major issues.Bluetooth is weak. It skips out easily, even with you phone just in your pocket.Battery life noticeably horrible, I will charge it for hours and get maybe 20 minutes out of it. I bought these a few weeks ago.When the battery is low, it very loudly yells ""battery low"" every 30-60 seconds. You cannot even enjoy the battery you have left because it screams at you. Mine are almost always low because of the poor battery life.This is a well designed product with some serious hardware problems. And fix that ""battery low"" voice. Very annoying.

Pretty much as good as any earbuds (wired and wireless) ...


I've owned some more expensive wireless earbuds, a lot more expensive and I find these Senso earbuds to be competitive.Sound: Very solid and balanced. Pretty much as good as any earbuds (wired and wireless) that I've owned. I use an equalizer app on my Android phone to balance frequencies, and I didn't feel like I needed to do much correction for these ones. I dropped a little of the low/mids out and added just a touch of the highest treble for crispness, but I did the least amount of adjustment compaired any of my headphones, speakers or car. Really pretty smooth. These earbuds provide a thick low end that's really nice. A little ""thumpy"" but By dropping the low-mids a bit I was able to correct it.Comfort: The fit is amazing for me. I know that we all have different sized heads and ears so there's no telling what you will experience. I'm a very tall guy with a big head and large ears. I've had problems with retention with many of my other earbuds. They slide out and wiggle around. When the become loose, I find that the bass ranges become lost and I'm always shoving the buds back in. I use mine at the gym and for running frequently, and the movement has jarred all of my other earbuds out of position. Not with these. They stay put. The ""over the ear"" hooks are super flexible and soft, so they don't become irritating over time. It seems they provide just enough firmness to keep the buds in place without discomfort in long term wear.Usability: I've only used the microphone a few times, but it seems to work well. I had a conversation in a crowed gym with somebody and they told me it wasn't too bad. In quite situations they work great. They appear to hold a long charge - I've never timed it, but I've used them on and off for many hours without needed a recharge. One big suggestion. Put out an app for both phone types that displays power levels.Durability: I'll update in the future. Too new to say. Haven't put them to the waterproof test yet.Value: Amazing. With Prime and a special offer these were super affordable. My daughter has some very expensive Beats with a similar look. They've been great earbuds and have been super durable. Maybe they sound just a bit better. But, they were almost 5X the cost. I feel like I got a really great deal, and I won't go into some state of anxiety if I loose them. I'll just order a new set.

connection to bluetooth easy and works well


This comment is off the top, so to speak. Well here we go. I must first state my ear's (where the buds are placed (ear canals) are small & I wear glasses. Maybe even my ear lobs are unusual shape, I'll not of aware of this aspect though. First the positive! I find charging, connection to bluetooth easy and works  well. I do find the control mechanism on the right ear bud to be challenging. In all fairness I must state I am 75 yo and the movement of the fingers are certainly not like my younger years. Still working, but just not quite in the same way with complete flexibility. I find that if I put the left ear bud in first and then use the control buttons while in the palm of my hand, the setup process works better.On the negative side (for me) is that my ear buds just do not fit my ears, even the smallest buds, and the loops on the individual buds do not stay on my ears unless I am setting still and not moving very much. (I wear glasses and the frames are very small).Again, on the positive side I do enjoy using this headphone and having mu hands free while I am on the phone. I've used these headphone for approximately 1 month and they serve my purpose; however, if you wear glasses & have small ear canals, consider this a caution for you. I definitely could not use on a treadmill nor extensive walking.To the Manufacture: Perhaps in the future you could make the fixed part of the ear piece smaller and compensate with a few enlarged rubber ear pieces? If this is workable Manufacturing solution take a stab at adjusting the ear loop so that it adheres to all glasses, just not resting on top/side of the glasses ear piece.The two star rating is to my individual case ( and your if you have issues like mine): so if your normal (haha) these headphone's will work well and you should enjoy. Not a perfect world, but still quite the experience.

Great headphones


I love these headphones!  Very comfortable, much better sound quality than the previous ear buds I had, and no cord jack to the phone that constantly gets tangled. They synced up to my phone and worked right away. The headphone has controls for volume and track skipping, so I don't ever have to pull the phone out of my pocket to make changes.Some other reviews said the part that goes around the ear is too soft and flexible.  I don't find that to be a problem.  That part just needs to hold the ear piece so it doesn't fall off, it works fine and I don't notice it at all.  A stiffer plastic part would probably be irritating.

Stay in place


These are better than I expected!  I have difficulties keeping headphones in one of my ears and these stay!  And the sound quality is pretty legit too. I wish they maybe went one notch higher on volume but at its highest, pretty much drowns out most of the gym noise. Happy with my purchase!

function fine but are a bit bulky


I have no real complaints except if i purchase another set I would look for the ear buds that have the controls away from the ears to cut down on the bulky look. I do like the wireless part of this technology over the wired earbuds I was using.

Sound nice, and they stay in my ears while working in the yard. I like that I can tap the button on the right ear to start and stop my iPhone playing music. The volume has plenty of range. I was able to pair them with my Kindle Fire as well as my iPhone. I think the cord could be a little shorter.

Sound great


The earbuds sound great. my problem is that I purchased them to listen to my FM MP3 player.When listening to FM the head set is the antenna. With Blue Tooth I have to use a 1/8 jumper to act as the antenna (not exactly convenient).  The problem is not with your product but with the FM MP3 player.

Great price, good sound, sweat resistant


I bought these for my wife as she is Professional Athletic Trainer for a Valentines present.  She works out several times a day and does sweat much.  Other Headphones did not last well or the sound was bad.  We are a couple of weeks in and she loves them.  I'm also impressed with the sound quality.  She has these paired with both her iPhone 8+ and iWatch.  When I call her when she's working out with just her watch, the mic works great and does not sound 'tinny'.  She tells me I need to get a pair.  Maybe that would motivate me to work out with her?  Nope, but I may get a pair at this price for my easier workout sessions.

Meh. Seemed OK, but was a bit disappointed.


This was my first bluetooth headphone purchase. I was not especially thrilled.  Sound was fine for the price, but they never seemed to stay in place. And the foam ear pieces came off far too easily. They did not re-connect to my phone as readily as another brand I bought last week.And - the sound on one side partially went out after a bit more than a year. Disappointed.

Awesome customer service!


My third pair of these in about a year (yeah I lose them/break them a bit often). All of them have been outstanding products; this one, however, seemed to have a receiver issue in the right ear that caused audio to pop in and out. I responded to an email from the company (they send you one when your device arrives) stating the problem. After walking through the issue, we determined it was the headphones themselves. From there, it was simple and easy for them to ship me a new pair of non-defective headphones. Easiest and least stressful customer service interaction I've ever had.

Good but not for small ears nor runners who run outside


Product itself seemed great. I'm a female and my ears are small. These fit inside my ear but were really uncomfortable. Also, as a runner I don't want to block out all noise for safety reasons and since these suction into your ear it's hard to hear anything but the music (which would normally be good). I like that it came with all these other pieces and accessories. The packaging was nice and the value was great - my ears are too small and I don't want to lose all sound so these weren't for me.

Badly Made


I ordered these headphones with the hopes that they would turn out good, however they are no longer functional. I received these headphones on a Thursday, I believe, by my Saturday workout one side was not working. The constant buzzing was not pleasurable either and just made the workout horrible. For the time I workout and the rigor I put them through, does not seem sufficient enough to ruin the headphones as claimed by the company. The rating of IPX7 would allow me to submerge these underwater, albeit I would never do so, however any track of sweat would render the headphones to a buzzing symphony and thus not being able to play music.

Don’t let the price fool you.  Exceptional headphones at a very reasonable price.


I lost my Bluetooth wireless headphones last week. The pair I lost were considerably more than the Senso Bluetooth headphones so I was not expecting much.  Boy was I surprised, these things sound great.  I received the package in 2 days with no issue and had the headphones connected within minutes.  My only regret is buying the really expensive ones prior to this. These are awesome sounding and fit well. Thanks.

Battery life


The head phones are ok. I can get good distance on an open floor plan, but not through walls. Sound is muffled, not enough clarity. After two months of use the battery life started out lasting over 8 hours and then dropped down to 5 hours (rapidly) during my second month of use. I probably used them 40 hours a week. They're rated for 8 hours of battery life.(Edited)......It seems that the headed phone does work for 8 hours, but if you depend on the recharging indicator (blue light) you will be disappointed in how many hours your head phones will last. If you over charge the unit, after the blue light has come on, you can expect longer hours.

Sorry to say but it is a complete disappointment - can't use it outdoor


Am I the only person here who used those headphones in outdoor environment  ?You simply can't run with those headphones due to the fact that there is a constant back ground noise from the wind in your hear  while you run or even when you stand still when there is a wind outside.The headphone is probably configured to play back whatever the mic picks up, which would create a constant background noise.

All about that bass...


The build quality seems fine and they are definitely functional. I kind of think most of the add-ins like the car charger and case are kind of silly. I am returning these because they are obnoxiously bass-y. I like my bass for the genres of music that deserve bass, but I listen to a lot of jazz but mostly podcasts while I'm working and the amount of bass these put out is simply unacceptable in my opinion.If you like bass, go for these because they seem perfectly acceptable otherwise.

Comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds which is great because as everybody knows, your ears are different sizes. The best value I have spent my money on this far.

I bought these wireless earbuds for 19$ and I expected it to be mediocre. Well, these are actually very good. First off these come with many accessories like a car charger, iPhone/Earbuds charger, and a carrier for these earbuds. Now for the earbuds themselves I have only been using them for a few days but from what I have experienced so far they are good, they fit on your ears and don't hurt your ears after 30 minutes-1 hour of usage. They also have good range and the Bluetooth connection never just dies randomly.5 Star this is actually a legit review so yeah l0l

Purchased in March of 2018, and product randomly became defective in April 2019.  Used headphones for roughly 40 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week until they stopped working. Did a factory reset, but headphones were not able to enter pairing mode.  Called Senso technical support and they confirmed that the headphones were defective, but that they could not offer a replacement since it had been just over a year.  Product not designed to last.  Sound quality and fit were “eh” to begin with.  Strongly recommend you buy a different product.  These are cr@p.

I was in a loud arena there were times that the noise inside the arena was a bit too much for the headphones to overcome, even at full volume.  But for the most part they worked great. I answered a phone call with them and even with the loud noise the caller could still hear me. I believe as long as they keep working at this level they will be well worth the price.

I accidentally washed SENSO Bluetooth Headphones.  After a week, they still work.


I bought SENSO Bluetooth Headphones last year.  I've used them without any problems during sports and commute.  Last week, I forgot them in the pocket of my jacket, and washed and bleached them in the washing machine for about two hours at 30 degrees Celsius. I realized them in my pocket before putting the jacket in the dryer.  When I checked if they worked, they didn't. So, I put them away.  Today, I re-checked if they worked, and to my surprise, they did.  I think SENSO makes high quality and sturdy products.  I am very happy.  Thank you very much SENSO.

Bulky, heavy, and the sound is just okay. Also, they look ridiculous when worn. They fall out every 10th step without fail and I have tried all the rubber sizing options.  The flimsy band that goes over the ear does absolutely nothing, does not hold the earbuds in place when I run, or even when I WALK. And the wind noise from these is God- Awful. Not a fan of these at all. Always remember folks, You get what you pay for!

You may ask why I give this five stars - I contacted the seller and mentioned my issue.

These headphones have great reviews and a friend has them as well with no issues.  I think I may have a faulty pair.  Each time I turn my head to the right, the sound/music cuts out/skips.  This includes streaming music and music saved/loaded to my phone.  At first I thought it was my running location, however, it happens whenever I wear them.

I was worried that they would not have enough noise reduction if I didn't shove them in my ear canal like I had to do with my old ones.  Surprisingly, you don't have to do that, and the ear clip is nice to keep them comfortably on your ear.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the blue light blinks regularly while the headphones are turned on and that is a bit annoying.  I also really like the cord that has the dual iPhone 6 and beyond port as well as the charging port all in one.  I've only been using these for about 1 week and am really liking them.

Minus one star because I received an open box version. Minus another star because the sound quality was a little weird. Treble was higher, bass was slightly muted, and midtones were also slightly muted. I'm not an audiophile in any way but I was listening to The Postal Service's The District Sleeps Alone Tonight and it just sounded weird. Try it and maybe you might understand what I mean. Then again it could be that I got messed up headphones. Overall, the packaging, instructions, and overall design of the headphones are great. Also I did find the ear hooks were a bit big for my ears.

I will give five stars if this product could fix this one issue: when battery is low, stop repeating to me frequently (per 30sec) and loudly (this volume is not controlled by you - it's default at loud) that battery is low! I got the message! It's just low, not dead, but keeping yelling at me ""battery low battery low"" could either give me a heart attack or kill my hearing someday.

Not good for biking/windy days


It's not as I expected, they stay on my ears which is great because my ears are really small, but if you're moving at high speeds (biking or running on a windy day) you can hear it through the headphones. Not exactly what I was hoping for, but they work as bluetooth headphones.

Good quality and value


Overall, I'm pleased with these headphones with regards to the quality of the sound and battery life. As I have only owned this product for less than a week, I cannot comment on its longevity. One minor disappointment is the advertised noise cancellation, which is non-existent apart from that which is naturally created by virtue of just having something inserted into the ears.

Awesome workout headset, budget ""PowerBeats""


Quick Pros & Cons:Pros:Price - soo much cheaper than other mainstream brands like Bose or DreBeatsFlexible hooks - the plastic over-the-ear hooks grip the back of the ear nicely without the feel of hard plastic.Package ""deal"" - it's great that the headset comes with a lot of items to help with carrying and maintaining the product.Battery life - Lasted for a while in one charge (~2hrs per day, for 4 days on one charge, turning it off after the 2hr training session).Cons:Not a ""truly"" secure fit - if doing anything that involves VERY quick change of directions (i.e. football, boxing, dance) earpiece might fly off.Durability is questionable - earpieces of the headset feels ""cheap"" to the point where if i drop it from head-height, i feel it would break.Background on why i bought these:As a strength and conditioning coach, I train in a variety of sports and training regiments. When listening to music, I prefer headphones that hooks over-the-ears because it feels more secure in my ear when doing a lot of quick-change-of-directions. Earbuds would fly out while sprinting, ear-muff type of headphones are too bulky, and having a cords connected to my phone/ipod sucks. I saw these after researching headsets that would be like PowerBeats but doesn't cost as much as $180.Why i like them:These ActivBuds have been working very well when I'm doing field drills, boxing exercises, and plyometrics. Definitely secure and great when lifting or jogging.It being sweatproof and bluetooth is a ""must"" for those that train for long hours, sweat a lot, don't like earbuds cause they don't quite fit right, and don't like to have their phone on them during exercises.I like how the company is asking for feedback soo quickly after purchasing them. Seems like they really take in feedback well to make their products better... or that can just be my ""wishful thinking.""What I don't like:How cheap it feels. I know i could be getting my money's worth, and i didnt pay much for this headset. It just feels like i can break the headset if i grasped them in my fist too hard.Durability or wear-n-tear on these is TBD cause it is recently mew to me. I would have to update on this aspect 8months later. I have been using this headset on a daily basis so i am definitely racking on ""mileage"" on them.Possible Improvements?I would like to see the earpieces have a magnet on them so that when you want to take them off your ears, but have them stay wrapped around your neck, the earpieces can ""attach"" to each other making the headset into a ""secure"" necklace. They have those for other headphones I have used like the Ironman Headphones.

Great buy


Great headphones, great price.  I had to use different sized earbud caps in each of my ears to keep them from falling out, but at least these came with several sizes to choose from.  The piece that fits over your ear is very loose, but it isn't an issue.  The volume is loud though, even when it is on the lowest setting.

Just an overall terrible product.


No sure why the reviews are high? Sound quality is bad. Like even for 30$... theyre built horribly! Every time I repositioned the right one in my ear I would ALWAYS accidentally crank up the volume absurdly high or I would turn it off. This is due to the fact that the buttons are VERY poorly placed.

Excellent headphones. I use them frequently while running and the sound quality doesn’t degrade once I start to sweat. There is some mild movement  around my ears depending on my movements but otherwise very stable. I lost the little cable stay provided almost as soon as I got it out of the box, however I don’t feel that it’s takes away from the quality of these headphones given the price.

Good range, long battery life.. Great for the price!


I got these for my boyfriend for Christmas and he uses them almost everyday. He says the range is great. At work, sometimes he'll leave his phone at his desk and go to the bathroom with the headphones still in, and they'd still be playing music. The carrying case is great for him because he had gone through at least 3 sets of earbuds that were broken/ripped due to his carelessness after he tossed them around. Being able to take phone calls with them is a plus too.

""Almost but not quite""


I decided to try these after my LG Electronics Tone Pro HBS-750 Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headset bit the dust. ""Bit the dust"" meaning I got tired of its tendency late in its lifespan to keep saying ""out of range trying to connect"" when it was 2 feet from my phone. This resulted in me snatching it off my head and breaking it into multiple pieces. (One can only take a females voice nagging about ""out of range, trying to connect"" so many times.) My Senso came in a nice box and nice accessories to compliment it. I purchased these as it had TONS of good reviews and its sole purpose was to listen to music while cutting grass. It came charged so I put them on, pairing was quick with no issues. Picked out a song to test the quality and clarity of the sound. Now mind you I only have my previous pair of LG Tone 750 to compare it to. All was fine until the song started and it was evident these were not as good as my now deceased LG set.Base was ok.. Highs were ok.... Mids were not there resulting in it throwing everything off and making it sound cheap. Now mind you its not an expensive pair, but neither was my LG as I checked the now lower price. Yes the Senso is sweat proof and probably make a good pair of workout earbuds. Good..not great. Will keep them to use this summer but will be going back to my LG brand later.UPDATE 5/21/17 Performed a calibration as suggested by Senso. Sound quality is still not up to par. Returning Item. Great customer service though.

Excellent bang-for-the-buck


I should justify my rating, because clearly these aren't the very greatest headphones in the world. But they certainly do stand out from the crowd for these reasons:* Excellent bang for the buck: the audio quality relative to their low price is fantastic.* Exceeded promises in what was delivered. In particular, there was an additional pair of foam tips included. I seem to be a mutant where normal rubber tips of any size don't fit me well, but the foam ones are great.* Really comfortable, irrespective of price.I was afraid that the flat cable would be annoying, but that seems not to be the case, it stays out of the way. The product description cites ""passive noise reduction"", which is of course silly: all that means is ""you're sticking something in your ears, which tends to block the sound"". And yeah, they do that, but so does any headphone.For those of you that want pumping bass, this might not be the best product for you. For very bassy tracks, I think I'm hearing just a bit of clipping. But that's not the kind of music I normally listen to, so for my purposes there's no problem. And on the other hand, I perceive the sound as being unusually clear. The instruments are standing out from each other, with nothing mushing together, so I'm able to hear subtle aspects of the performance.I have not tested the performance of the microphone - I've got a good Plantronics device for when I need to do that kind of thing. I was only interested in this for music, and I'm happy with it in this role.

Earbuds that are comfortable and so lightweight that you hardly notice you're wearing them.  They travel well in their own hardshell case.  The sound quality is wonderful.  I've had no static or dropped connections whether with my mobile or my laptop.I especially want to give a huge shout out to Invotek Customer Service.

Good Wireless Headphones - But Needs improvements - Power Drain Issue


Since they worked flawlessly, I did not want to part with them and ordered a replacement pair.  I experienced a problem with the new pair and so I contacted product support.  This time they answered my question and I implemented their recommendation. and so far I have not had any more problems with the Headphones.  I will update my review as I evaluate the product.  Update:  I have written to their product support and I described how to make improvements to the product but they have not replied.  They need to improve battery consumption as I don't want to recharge them every day and that is what my recommendations address.I am very disappointed with the lack of response from their support staff.  This product does have consumption mishandling issues that apparently their support staff either cannot work on their own product or do not want to.  The bottom line is that this product does have some issues that should be fixed but as to when they are going to, it's an unknown.  I do not understand their silence.  I do not undestand why they don't make the improvements as I outlined to the manufacturer

3rd time purchasing this brand and probably my last (insert sad face). The issue I have is with the design.

Descent headphones for the price. Sound quality is good enough for most runners. easy to charge. nice storage case. Multiple ear pieces to ensure snug fit. Lightweight cord is the real plus for me, that way there is not volume/battery pack smacking you in the neck/face when you run and workout. Unfortunately they stopped working after two uses...not sure the water resistant thing is accurate. However, there were zero issues with a full refund.

Depends what you are looking for


I haven't read any reviews on here, but just wanted to share my opinion on the bluetooth headphones from SENSO. The reason why I am giving it 4 stars is bc they are solid headphones nothing special tho. Music isn't that great on these, but they do give you abunch of tools & additives like a cool charger for an Iphone & the device. Also a car 2 USB charge port. If you really like listening to podcasts or books on audio you'd enjoy this product. If you are all about sound quality with the newest songs I would look elsewhere

I really liked these...until about a week ago when they just stopped charging. It’s not the cable, I’ve used several. There’s no wear and tear on them because I kept them on my nightstand to use when I didn’t want to wake my husband. I like the fit and function...and they came with a cool case, but bottom line...they don’t work anymore. Only 9 months later.

A gem hiding in plain sight


Absolutely amazing headphones. To spare you reading, I'll just jump right into the pros and cons.Pros:1) Great sound. The bass is noticeably present but it isn't overdone. If you're an audiophile, you will obviously be disappointed, but if you're a general user who DOES know the difference between good and bad quality audio, you'll be colored very impressed, as I was/still am.2) They fit very snugly into your ear canal, without feeling intrusive. Because of this, it generates very good ""noise cancellation"" as these headphones don't seem to have ""noise cancellation"" as a feature, but the headphones DO a good job of cancelling outside noise when listening to music.3) These won't fall out of your ears at the gym whatsoever, unless you're being punched in the face repeatedly.4) Lightweight, but good quality build.5) The amount of THINGS you get!: carrying case, car charger, micro-USB cable, extra budsCons:1) Not the most aesthetically pleasing to look at from the outside in, but for what they are meant for, who cares?2) People will glasses (like me) will feel a slight discomfort the first few times wearing them. You'll have to adjust how you wear them so the loop sits comfortably behind your year.3) The wire connecting the ear pieces is very thin, so just be careful during storage. Would NOT recommend shoving these in your pocket.4) MicroUSB instead of USB-C :( but this is so minor I don't know why I'm mentioning itOverall, I'm really happy I got these; I've had them for all of a week, and I'm already recommending these to everyone I know, and I'm getting similar responses back.

Sleeper of a product


Being a frustrated beats wireless customer last week I stumbled upon these. Figured why not give it a try and received them Friday. Was impressed with the packaging and presentation. Once I synced them up to my iPod and got them on was happily surprised.  Went right to my golf club and got a practice session in with them. Super clear and no cut outs. I think as this brand gets more and more known even more people will realize they can get a very high quality product at a great price. Also will say there customer service is 5 star.

Ok, if you keep them dry


These were some of the longer lasting bluetooth headphones I've had.  Sweat will kill them pretty quickly though.  I got about a month of running with them 5 days a week before they died.  Not great, but better than most in the price range.

Great for its main purpose.


If you are really just wanting these to listen to music while you work out, then these are excellent. I was really looking for something that would work as a Bluetooth for my phone as well. However, when you are wearing just one in your ear, the other side tends to pull the one out of your ear. People did have trouble hearing me, so I'm back on my quest.

... these headphones during Prime Day and was initially very pleased with the fit and sound


I bought these headphones during Prime Day and was initially very pleased with the fit and sound.  But, I noticed that the bass in some songs was extremely distorted.  I originally thought that I shouldn't expect much from a $30 pair of headphones and could live with the inferior bass range.  But, I reached out to the company to see if anyone else had a similar problem.  They responded very quickly and initially had me reset the headphones, which didn't improve the bass.  I contacted them again and they immediately sent me another pair and the sound is great!  No problems with the bass at all!  I don't know if I'm more impressed with the headphones or their customer service!  Definitely worth purchasing!

These are every bit as good (and in many ways better) than the $200 beats that I also have. I keep the beats in my locker and use the senso at home. I prefer the senso especially at its price point. After about five months of use my Senso stopped working and the company was very responsive immediately sending a new pair out. The same thing happened to my beats and I had to go to the apple store and wait in line, have them troubleshoot where they said they had to send it back to the factory to repair/replace. I highly recommend this product!

I really like these headphones


I really like these headphones!  They fit very well - the flexible, over the ear piece makes them remarkably comfortable, as well as the angle of the piece that actually fits in my ear.  I love that they have a carrying case included, and the car charger and cord is a bonus!  The reason I only give it 4 stars is that I think the multifunction button is a little awkward (I have to push REALLY hard to turn it on and off), and it doesn't ""say"" that it is in pairing mode.  I can adapt to both, so I think it's a great product!

Dead within the year


These headphones had a decent battery life and sound quality. However, after about a year of using them with running and cycling, they're dead! they won't turn on at all anymore, even when fully charged. Definitely disappointing they only lasted a year. Their fit could also use some improvement. I felt I was constantly needing to readjust them as I ran.

Package arrived from seller on time and in perfect condition. Immediately I opened and tried the Senso Bluetooth. First I put them on in did some head banging. To see how well they will hold when I do intensive gym training. They never came off.I then turned them on to see how well they work. Needless to say.

Not sure how and why some of the good reviews.I took these out for a short run, about 30 minutes and have to say these are junk. After about 10minutes I was so tired of pushing these back in I just pulled them off and ran without the remaining time. As soon as u swear, these WILL NOT stay in. On top of that, I had to place my Sandisk clip on my shirt collar because they were constantly skipping and cutting in and out.Not worth the trouble.

Purchased these in headphones 8 months ago (3/8/17). Have logged hundreds of miles of pavement and trails with these in my ears. Great sound quality for all music types, as well as podcasts and audio books. Never had any issues with battery life.  With 20 mile training weeks, I get a few weeks of time per charge. Once the battery life beeping starts, you have less than a mile before they shut off. I always ensure a full charge before a big race in preparation for my uninterrupted motivational needs.

Good for staying put but not great for sound quality.


The high stars is because it totally serves the purpose I need: wireless, stable, comfortable headphones for working out.But the sound quality is not great; you basically loose most to all bass section so it really changes the dynamic of the song. And the terrible section can be a little too tiny/bright.If aren’t using these for professional sound you’re fine. It’s nice enough to work but not so expensive I feel like I can’t throw them in my gym bag and forget about them.

Really great range on the Bluetooth


Really great range on the Bluetooth, sound quality is great, good mic, really solid battery life (especially with such a small package) and awesome accessories to boot.  Earbuds without the hooks will fall out of my ears within the first few seconds of any activity so earhooks are a must for me.  Some people make them out of hard plastic though which can hurt my ears after a while.  These earhooks are nice soft rubber and feel great.  My only knock on the earhooks (and it's a tiny one) is that I wish they were just a bit denser material as they are a little too floppy and can move around a smidgen.  Overall, highly recommended.

I’ve had these for almost a year and without fail, as soon as I start sweating heavily, which happens on long runs, the Bluetooth radio seemed to disconnect.It was a minor inconvenience until recently, when the Bluetooth radio ceased working altogether. The unit charges and powers on and off as normal, but it will not enter pairing mode, it does not appear as broadcasting on any of my devices, and it will not connect to my previously paired devices.I tried factory resting the unit and that did nothing.

Quality of sound is Good, not a complaint because these are not $100 pair + but if your listening to music with a large amount of bass they will distort that bass.

Terrible for Apple Watch.


I have had these headphones for sometime now. I find that they work great for casual use with an iPad or laptop or similar device. They are not great for running utilizing just an Apple Watch  if you wear your watch on your left hand they will not receive the Music without stops and starts and static.  I have to wear my watch on my right hand for them to work well. I suspect it's because the distance from my right ear to my left hand is just too far for the range of these headphones.

Great Gym Headphones.


These are great workout headphones.I was looking for some wireless earbuds that would actually stay in my ears while at the gym. These Senso earbuds do just that - it's just a matter of experimenting with the bud size (they supply options) - and getting the angle right.The wireless aspect of this device was one of the main factors for my purchase. Bluetooth connectivity is easy - I connected up to my iPhone straight away.Audio quality is surprisingly good. They're as good as, if not better than, poser brands that cost a great deal more.In addition, the accessories are worth the price tag alone. Lightening cable, dual car charger, charger and power cable are included in a stylish protective zip case.Definitely worth buying - highly recommended.

To get the perfect balance, use with the Late Night equaliser of the Iphone and see the magic. No noise while using the mic. Although you have to be a bit on the louder side since the mic is embedded in the earpiece. But that's not a hurdle at all since the light weight and extremely comfortable design makes sure that you don't mind keeping it on for longer hours. Good job Senso!!! I'm certain there's no point spending on the big brands for wireless earphones.

Started out Great- getting buggy now.


At first they were great. Love being able to talk on the phone, and the music sounds great too! However now I have more and more trouble with the connection to my iPhone 7 Plus. It’ll randomly cut out, make beep noises and randomly say “connected” very distorted in the middle of listening.Over the last few weeks the quality has been degrading. Hoping to reach out for a warranty replacement.

Love these for my Treadmill


Love these for my Treadmill. I watch YouTube and other stuff while I walk to a healthier self and use these to spare the household. They’re a bit bulky feeling around my ear but it’s not a big deal. They do cancel our noise which means you hear better. Love them for the price.

These were rated the second best buy by the experts (my research on wireless earbuds).  Biggest issue they said was setting up.  For my phone (Samsung S6) it was a piece of cake.  Only used once but worked great so far.  Did set my default phone to the bluetooth setting but that is easy to change.

Best Sound quality for the price.


I ordered  this one and the anger sound core, this senso had the best sound vs anker. This is audible at a distance of 27 ft and then drops further. Anker was good upto 65 ft of distance but even with loudest volume it was hard to hear from the anker. Conclusion I tested both the headphones and senso this model was a he best in sound quality, nice cancellling. I would definitely recommend this one. It is 5 days of use since I bought and I am happy so far.

Definitely began to develop difficulties in connecting the earphones to my iPhone via bluetooth; would audibly say ""connected"" but not actually connect to the audio function of my iPhone for a good minute or two of turning off the earphones and my iPhone bluetooth, then turning them back on so as to restart the process. Also does not have a magnetic strip on the earphones so as not to lose or drop the earphones as easily (as my previous pair of Phaiser earphones did).

My husband ordered these actually. We’ve always spent $80+ on headphones, just for them to break within a year so we decided to get something cheaper. So far these seem pretty great. He says they are Comfortable and the sound quality is impeccable. Definitely 5 star worthy. Sadly, my ears are to small so there’s no way I can’t get them to fit and stay. Thankfully, they are my husbands lol.

I don’t write many reviews, but this product warrants one. I’ve had 4 of these headsets over the last 3 years and they are hands down the least expensive best option for easy to use good sounding blu tooth ear buds. Sure you can pay $150 for a great pair of brand name, or you can spend less than $30 that will last you about a year.

Terrible Range


I want to like them for a lot of reasons, but I don't. The nit picky issue is that the little plastic flap that covers the charger doesn't fit back well again after you take it out to charge.The real issue, though, is that the range is awful. I am six foot two and if I have my phone in my back pocket and turn my head, the sound starts to cut out. So it is a little less than a three foot range, unacceptable.Edit:I am still not sure what the issue is, but I left my phone sitting on my desk the other day and wandered off and found I got a good 10 to 12 feet before there was an issue. Yet when the phone is in my back pocket or my backpack 24 inches away I get weird sound issues whenever I turn my head. I am upgrading to three stars as there are no issues when the phone is not somehow covered.Incidentally, I have tried this with different phones so I do not suspect it is a defect in the phone.

The sound on these headphones is extremely impressive for the price.  I've owned quite a few pairs of Bluetooth ear buds, including Jabras that we're three times the cost.  These Sensos beat them all hands down in the sound department.  I'll repost more info after I get a few runs in with them.

Great sound for a great value


I read at least 50 reviews for six different Bluetooth headphones before choosing these.  Three requirements were tops on my list - comfort during treadmill running, great bass, and a solid value. These headphones delivered on all three! I was also impressed with the “little extras” — the carrying case and magnetic cell phone car holder were nice touches. Overall, buy these for the quality of the sound and ease of use. For me, five stars would mean Bose-quality sound, but for under $30 the solid audio and overall quality can’t be beat.

Sound is OK but fit is not so good.  The ""over the ear"" piece is much to soft / malleable and doesn't stay on my ear.  I got these mainly for audible/eBooks on my Kindle and the sound is fine for that and I love the flexibility I have with them being wireless (not tethered to my Kindle and can walk around).

I bought this product on mid October, 2018 and on January 8, 2019 (less than 3 months) isn't working anymore. It bothers me that I bought this to be broke so soon. Itsound pretty good but it didn't last more than 3 hrs. At the beginning one ear bud stop working and in less than a week it became unresponsive completely. I'm a mail carrier (hard job under the weather and around the holidays, 10-12 hrs per day 6 days a week) and listening to music while working makes my days more bearable. I would appreciate if someone contact me cause I miss the window to return it and because is not fair either.

This was my first purchase of bluetooth earbuds. I reviewed several products from the low to high range and checked the feedback on the various products. I found several features that I felt were important for reliability and performance. They were durability, Android and Kindle Fire compatibility, sound quality, sweat resistance, and secure fit in the ear. Price was also a factor in my consideration because I did not want pay a lot and then be dissatisfied with the product. After reviewing the various earbuds and reading the feedback, I selected the SENSO S-250 earbuds because they advertised the features I was looking for as well as being  at a very reasonable price. They had the highest waterproof rating (IPX7), good playback of 8 hrs, Integrated Mic, control media playback, and hands free calling. The earbuds arrived promptly and I was impressed with the packaging. Usually you unpack the product and throw the box away. The box was well worth keeping to store the various components, booklet, cables etc.  I was impressed with the quality and feel of the product.  I installed the smallest set of ear tips and they stayed securely in the ear while I exercised. I also exercise on an elliptical/ recumbent machine and sweat quite a bit. I was concerned because the earbuds would get wet, but I simply wiped them off after exercising and I did not have problem with the moisture. The earbuds connected to my Android phone and Kindle Fire with no problem. The sound quality was much better than I expected. The base sounded great and yet was not overpowering. The vocal was clear and the volume levels had very good range. It was much better than I expected from a small set of earbuds. I feel it was a very good value for the price and I am very satisfied with my purchase of the S-250 earbuds. I have not yet had a chance to try them on a phone call.  I should point out that I have a background as a Manufacturing Engineer and dealt with quality issues as part of my job so I'm pretty picky. I would like to point out that I paid the advertised price for the earbuds and did not receive any compensation for my feedback.

Awesome headphones, great bass, delivered quickly... not quite as good as my professional in-ear monitors, but pretty darn close (and not $1000, either). A little distortion when listening to heavy bass at full volume, but MUCH better than anything else I've used in this price range... and I've used a LOT of headphones and earbuds (I've been a sound guy for over 40 years).

I've been using the headphones for a few days now, and I've really enjoyed them. They are easy to connect to your different devices (so far I'm at 3 different ones that I've connected to), and they are comfortable to wear. They also come with several accessories, including three different eartip sizes, two wire ties, a carry case, a charging cable, a cellphone card wallet, and a cellphone car mount.

They just don't work at all.


I just received these headphones two days ago. Since then, I have tried to get them to play without skipping. I've done everything, but even sitting right next to my phone, in my house, with no interference or movement or anything, they skip constantly. They are brand new, right out of the box, haven't left my house yet---and they skip 60-70 times a minute. I like everything else about them--they are comfortable and fit well and come with nice accessories--but they don't work. I'm so disappointed.

too loose for me


The hooks over the ears are too floppy and large for me, they do not stay in my ears.  In particular my right ear, and I'm not sure if it is because of the mechanics in that side making it slightly heavier; but it will not stay in my ear.  I have tried all the sizes of buds.  Outside of that, connecting was easy, and they play music with decent quality.

They irritate my ears, but the sound is okay!


The headphones seem to work fine. My biggest gripe is that they come with the round inserts which bother my ears. I'd prefer the flatter ones with the slight hook to ensure they stay in and don't irritate me. The sound seems okay and they were easy to sync with my phone. I have yet to try to sync them with a 2nd device, I'll try that and will update my review.

Been using these headphones while running for about a month or two now. They pair up with my S7 with no issues. The range seems good. I ran in the rain once and they held up well, but did cut out a few times over the course of 2 hours. My ears are rather small so it was awesome that they include different sized ""ear adapters"" Not sure what to call them. Battery life has been great.

Sound quality is great, but the biggest con to these ear buds ...


Sound quality is great, but the biggest con to these ear buds are that they do not stay put. I have tried the different sizes (which I do not think they included the small size in my packaging) and they immediately fall out while running. The plastic piece that is supposed to fit around the ear is way to big. I have to try and tuck the plastic in my hair to stay in place.  I read other reviews that say the plastic is bendable which is not true. If you are planning on running, jumping, or a vigorous workout I would not suggest these headphones. The price point is okay but when these go I would not purchase again.

SENSO ActivBuds for Running


I am a distance runner living in the U.S. Southwest desert.  I typically wear earbuds/headphones while running, and occasionally for walking, yardwork, etc.  A few months ago, I switched from wired to wireless headphones and first tried the Mpow [Gen-2 Version] Cheetah Bluetooth Headphones V4.1, which have a short/tight crossover cable/strap and work well, except I develop pressure-related pain behind my ears after two or three hours of running.I bought the ActivBuds to try a looser fitting crossover cable.  Both headphones have over-the-ear support, but the ActivBuds are made of a softer, flexible silicone or silicone-like material.  The crossover cable/strap is also a soft silicone or silicone-like material.  The soft, almost-sticky material is great for the ears, but if the cable rests against my neck, it sticks to my skin and pulls the headphone bodies out of my ears when I turn my head.  But, I have to do something with the strap anyway, to prevent it from tangling with my backpack, so the stickiness is not an issue, but it might be for certain users, depending on the activity.Here's my runners' solution.  The ActivBuds come with a clasp (""cinch button"") that slides over the crossover strap to vary its tightness.  I bought a 1-inch rubber washer with a 1/16-inch hole in the center (available at real hardware stores), slipped the washer onto the strap (folded at the center), followed by the cinch button.  I then tuck the strap inside and over the adjustment band on the back of my hat (like some runners do with a pony tail) and the washer keeps the strap/button from sliding back over and out of the hat adjustment band while running.  This way, I can adjust the tightness easily and the strap stays in place, above my neck and away from my backpack.I am not an audio expert, but, for me, the ActivBuds sound great.  I like the multi-function use for both the primary multi-function button, as well as the volume controls.  Both controls are easy to reach while running.The box contains an auto USB adapter (car charger, two charge levels) a short USB cable, a longer USB cable, multiple sets of ear tip covers, the adjuster button/nut, a carrying case, and the headphones.My original headphones were defective--the right ear tip was rotated much lower than the left, forcing the headphone body much too high, such that the over-the-ear piece was 1/4 inch above my ear, and, hence, they would fall out repeatedly.  I emailed the vendor describing the problem and they promptly sent me a replacement set of headphones, which work well.

Same day  one call!  this is a great companyuse the natural foam ear buds  watch for ear damage due to the loudness and check the caps where the red logo is every so often and maybe hit it with dab of super glue to hold it onother than that these rockwell update for third time the covers popped off and for the third time they stopped charging  so derated my review to three stars

Great for music when its not beeping in my ear


I would give it a 2.5 though its not available. Great for music when its not beeping in my ear, and it doesn't always do the beeping noise. Really bad for talking on. If you live in a congested area it gets all messed up with the wireless waves.  It's always connecting or disconnecting.

Love the headphones!! I Usually don't review products, although I do read reviews. I have very sensitive ears and it's hard to find any earphones that work well and don't trigger a migraine. These work great!! I left my phone on my desk at work, was able to get all the way to and in the ladies room before they stopped getting the signal. Much further than 30 feet! Also, they are very comfortable and don't hurt my ears. I wear glasses, so wasn't sure how these would work with them, but no issues. I am very highly satisfied with this product!

I only use them for about 1.5 hours a day and probably have to charge them after 2-3 days.

I just used these earbuds for the first time. 100 mile motorcycle ride at speeds up to 70 mph.  Great sound, no problems with wind noise and ver comfortable.  I wish I had bought them sooner and saved myself some money and hassle of the previously purchased earbuds that kept falling out and didn't have the quality of sound that these do.  Cost and quality equals outstanding buy. Waiting on the three year warranty I purchased for about 6 bucks. If no problems with registering for warranty then I will recommend highly and probably purchase more for my fellow firefighters!

Love these earphones


I bought these headphones to replace the stock apple EarPods because I fly a lot for work and there was too much noise so I couldn't enjoy music or movies. These earphones cancel all that out while giving crisp sound with decent bass. I didn't want to spend the $100-$200+ for earphones and I'm glad I came across these. Even have a coworker who has beats and couldn't believe how good these sound for the price, even admitting they sound just as good at times as the beats. I've also had no problems with the mic using phone calls, everyone hears me clearly and I can hear them just as clear also. Highly recommend a set of these.

So far so good.  Fairly comfortable, decent sound.  A little bulky, but they work well.  They don't fit or sound as good as the Plantronics Backbeat Fit headphone I had (and lost -- grrr) but they were a darn sight cheaper.  They sound better and fit a lot better than the Jaybird X2, which were constantly falling out of my ear.  I needed a good pair for the gym, these do the job and at good value.

Wow these headphones are awesome. I’ve owned the Bose soundsports, jaybird x3, jaybird freedoms, the beats, wired boss head phones and many more headphones. These headphones (for the price) are amazing. The sound isn’t quite as dynamic as jaybird but they’re louder and that makes up for it. I haven’t played with any of my EQ settings yet either. I would rather buy these than ANY of those major brands i listed above. If you’re on the fence let this be a testament. I will update if anything goes wrong on these. These rock.

Like the ease of use


Like the ease of use. Little bulky, but stayed in my ear during first runs. Battery life is a question, but it is too early to tell if it is a real concern or if I just really used them longer than I thought.The distance between phone and ear buds really is limited to a short distance, which is good for not picking up someone else's device but can also be frustrating when it clicks or quiets when you are doing a sit up. Certainly the right price!

I bought these as a result of many good reviews along with a good price. When I brought them home they connected immediately to my phone. But the part that goes over the ear is so flimsy that they don't stay on my ears and eventually fall off. I'm disappointed that they aren't more rigid for a sport earphone.

I bought these headphones about 6 months ago and I really like them. They sit comfortably in the ears and the sound quality is great for the price range. These come in a very nice case and have some extra ear buds.A few days ago, I had a problem with the left headphone no longer working. I contacted SENSO because the product was under a 1 year warranty and they were incredibly helpful. They originally tried to help me fix the problem without replacement which, unfortunately, did not work. After that attempt the immediately shipped me out a brand new pair.So in summary, this is a great product and the service I got with it was fantastic!

I returned this model because I could not get the ear buds to seal in either ear, I think because the earpieces are too far away from my ear canal while the support hooks are over my ears.  I cannot make any other judgement of the sound or operation because I could not get it to fit my ears.

Great Alternative to expensive powerbeats


These headphones are great. They have all the features of powerbeats for only $40. The sound is great. They are actually so loud I have to turn the music down. With my old apple headphones there were times the volume was all the way up and I still couldn't hear. The only thing I wish they would improve on a little is the ear hook. It could be just a bit stiffer. They've never fallen off my ears while running, but I always feel like the left one might. I've gone two weeks before having to charge and this is using them frequently. I make sure I don't plug them in until they start telling me the battery is low though.

A winner - or is it


My previous bluetooth earbuds died so I saw all the positive reviews on the Senso and decided to go with it. I like that it comes with all the extras, that it has a long battery life and that it immediately connects to my phone and I don't have to go into settings, disconnect and reconnect like my old set required me to do.Update: I have been using these earbuds for awhile and am not really satisfied but I don't know what the cause is. I have an iphone 5 and when I use these buds the music skips all the time. I have tried rebooting both the buds and the phone, I have turned off wifi, I have moved the phone around on my body thinking my bod was shielding the signal, I have taken the phone to the shop and had them look for circuit board cracks or corrosion. I was told that if the bluetooth is acting up, it can't be repaired and to fix it would encompass replacing the phone's motherboard and if I was going to do that it would be better off to get a new phone. So then I got out my old phone, a Samsung S3, and decided I would use it for my MP3 files. I found that the Samsung was also skipping. I was doing floor stretches at the gym and had the phone laying on the floor beside me about an arm's length away. It was still skipping. I found that I could pass my hand over my phone about 3 or 4 inches away from it and the file would skip. I am beginning to wonder if I were to spend $$$ on a new phone if it would still act the same. Do my new earbuds have low reception capabilities? Anyone else having problems with skipping? How do I fix it? Should I return this?

Solid battery life even in extreme temperatures.


I wear these and listen to music and podcasts all day at work. I work 12 hour shifts in a warehouse and battery life on these bad boys is solid. Even in a -10° and refrigerated environment. I’ve also used them in the sauna/steam room and shower at my gym. No issues.I hardly ever turn them to full volume unless the podcast quality sucks. Blocks out background noise but I can still hear people talking to me and forklift horns around me.They grip my ears just fine and stay put with a beanie on. They’re a little bulky but it’s whatever for the price. I bought the extended warranty but haven’t had to use it yet.

WOW! GREAT SOUND 🔊 GREAT VALUE!


These were delivered yesterday. About 4 days so fast delivery. First impressions: Awesome!They sound fantastic, deep base, not overdone or muffled, great highs and midrange. These get very loud and do not distort. I won't be playing these anywhere near their max as the sound is very loud and clear. Pairing could not have been easier and they can pair with two devices at once (play music from one device at a time of course) so, having my Samsung Gear 2 watch and mobile phone both paired I can toggle back and forth effortlessly.The quality of the headphones and design are top notch. Easy controls on the right ear bud. The fit and comfort is wonderful, with the over the ear loop, these guys are not going anywhere, though I have not had a chance to road test running. I can say that they seem snug and very comfortable. Also, I don't have to jam the buds in my ear just to get them to stay on or get excellent base out of them. The cable that connects the ear buds and goes behind the neck seems to be just the right length, not too long or to short for me.The extras that come with these, long charging cable for either iPhone or Android, short USB charging cable, car lighter dual car charger and the hard shell case are wonderful. What a tremendous value!To be tested is going for a run, battery life and whether these don't malfunction. Judging by what I see and hear so far, I think I won't be let down. Highly recommend so far!

I had to drop the rating from 5 star to 2 star because if problems operating when other SENSO headfphones are in the same gym


============================Update on my experience as of March 2017.I gave a glowing 5-star report in my original review. However, I am going to have to reduce the rating to 2 stars because these earbuds do not work well when there are multiple sets of these in the same gym. I confirmed this when I purchased a set for my son as well. He was experiencing drop-out problems when we were together. At other times, I would experience the drop-out.  The solution was for me to turn my set off.I travel a lot, so I visit a lot of gyms - so I was able to further confirm this in multiple locations in North America. I was in an out-of-state gym where I started having the problem. I looked around and found another user of the exact same earbuds.  Today, I stepped into my home gym and did a visual scan. Immediately I saw another man wearing these earbuds, and just turned mine off and put them in my bag so that I would not cause interference with his set.IF SENSO can solve this problem then I will switch the rating back to 5 stars. The sound is incredible - when the earbuds are not interfering with other SENSO earbuds.============================I've tried many different Bluetooth headphones designed for the gym. Some of them were physically painful to my ears because of poor fit. One pair would not stay in my ears - and I couldn't even make it through one workout with them. Most of them have poor bass, low sound quality, or low sound amplification. Some have buttons so small that you will need to turn them on and off with a finger nail.I saw the high rating on these and decided to try another pair. I was not ready for the high quality of the sound when I paired these to my HTC One and played back a test workout song. Wow. They the most comfortable earbud headphones I have ever worn. They are easy to put on. They are easy to power on and off. And the sound is outstanding. (Especially considering the price. The sound quality rivals $100+ earbuds.) If you like a good solid bass sound for your workout - then I highly recommend these. Once these are running, outside sound will not easily make it to your ears. I could not be happier with this purchase. No wonder these are rated so highly by most users.These are so good, I would've given them a sixth star if Amazon had one.

The sound is a little too dark for my taste.  Not so crisp or sensitive to highs like other higher end earphones.  Being said that, if your device have equalization you can tweak the frequencies you want and can make them sound quite good.  The volume is LOUD.  Just a few clicks and you are good.  The connection and range is awesome. The controls are easy to manage. Also the battery charge is really good and the fit acceptable with little to no discomfort.

Great Customer Service


Headphones are pretty good for the price. I had an issue so contacted the seller and they were prompt and gave good service. Very satisfied.The headphones needs a bit more tuning. The bass is a strong and the connection isn't always perfect. However, good sound for the price and I had no issues with it falling off during my runs.

Update:  Support exists!


Ordered beginning of May.  Worked fine for first 6-8 weeks.  No longer working.  Originally thought this was a good value, but now a waste of 30 plus dollars....unfortunately no mechanism to return or get repaired from seller.  Would not recommend and would question the positive reviews for this product!Update:  Company provided contact info and good phone support.  After a reset issues seemed to Improve.  Hopefully, this will be a permanent fix, but if not I was instructed to contact again.

Headphones were great for the first couple of months.  Then I had a problem. My first email to support was returned with troubleshooting instructions in 10 minutes (on a Sunday Evening no less).  The instructions didn't solve the problem, so I sent a follow-up.  That email was returned in 5 minutes with an offer to send a replacement.

Perfection!


Music is everything when I workout (-if it sounds sh*tty, my workout will be, too). My last one went through 4 years of sweat, fog, being dropped, left in my car, abused by the heat, sand, a teenager and the left bud stopped working- rightfully, so. It was finally time for a new set. It needed to withstand my workout habits- ie, Les Mills/Insanity, so- Wireless; fog/humidity/heat, so- Resilient etc. It needed to be durable, but had to sound good, too (i.e. ""if it sounds sh*tty, the workout will be, too""). I circled Beats by Dre, like a shark. I loved how they sounded, but didn't want to drop $200+ bones on headphones I'd sweat in. I started looking at TrebLabs because they were waterproof. I took a chance on Senso, ONLY because it offered 1 day shipping w/Prime. Had it not- I would've gone w/TrebLabs. -I'm so glad I did!They say 'You get what you pay for"" -don't let that scare you because they're relatively inexpensive- considering what you're getting! I love them! They're very durable, they don't tangle, the music is crystal clear, sweatproof (survived 3 rounds of HIIT) and I've only had to recharge it once, in the past 5 days. I have not submerged them (yet), nor used them for talking (I bought them w/the intent of working out). It also came w/a hard-shell pouch. I'm very happy with these! I can't remember the last time I was so excited for a gadget!

Can be better


Does have an issue with these headsets pairing with iPhone. I usually have to connect and disconnect multiple times to make sure the caller on other side is able to hear me.But when once connected, the audio quality was good. It's not noise canceling earphones thoughThe car charging cable provided doesn't work and I'd to pull over on hwy since my ph ran out of battery when I thought it's getting charged.

Worth it


Nice. These are my first Bluetooth headphones. I wear headphones often especially when working around the house. I am an avid music listener with my home stereo and I use high quality speakers.These get the job done. You get what you pay for. The bass is pretty strong. Overall, they are pretty loud. I am ""hard"" of hearing due to my loud work environment but would say these could drown out anything you didn't want to hear. The mids and highs could be crisper. Again, you get what you pay for. They are comfortable though.  I was tired of getting my headphones ripped out of my ears when doing yard work and is my main reason for purchasing. At this point I am satisfied.They do have a warranty too which is nice.I havnt tested the battery life fully.

I've owned many others.  At this price I am planning on buying more Highlights: Much better sound than competition, much better battery life than competition, I personally like the flexible ear straps although I can see some disliking, no connection issues so far, really nice accessories, not flimsy, comfortable.

I've used these several times since purchasing in 2018, but I used them yesterday (9/04/19) under a full charge while doing yard work. They lasted greater than 2hr45min, stayed in my ear and maintained a great full range sound. I was able to push-mow, weedeat and use my leaf blower and still hear what I was listening to with clarity.

DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!!


I bought these to wear at several running events and they failed on me after the second run. I called to have them replaced and the customer support staff at Senso told me on two occasions that (over 3 months) that the replacement headphones were on their way. When I called again after 5 months to check on my replacement order, they told me I was beyond my warranty and would have to submit my complaint via email with the details that I had already provided via the phone 3 times.

Mine were defective


I have to go with 3 stars because I ordered two and one was defective, the other was great! I ordered 2 of these in one order and gave one to my daughter as a gift. She loves them! But I couldn't keep them on my ears. Recently she was in town and borrowed mine and said that mine were not the same. Mine had very floppy ear pieces which would not hold on to ears. Mine were defected and I didn't realize it until she showed me hers. How can I get a new pair? I'd love to hear from the seller. I'll write a new review if I hear from the seller.

Excellent for active use - gym, cycle, track - paired w/ iWatch series 3 & iPhone6


These are excellent for use in the gym, cycling, on the track, etc. For the price point (~$30) I don't know why anyone purchases anything else for 5-7 times more. I've paired with my iPhone 6 and iWatch series 3 to listen to iTunes workout playlists. Once I figured out pairing and how it can get corrupted (with any bluetooth product), any frustration I had with them has gone away. They come in Apple-style packaging with multiple size earbuds, carrying case and charger, plus dual car charge adapter - great standard accessories! Not only that, the company is quick to respond with tips/helps if you have any issues with connection, etc. The only other thing I've wanted changed is the ability to set EQ from the watch since it is a bit heavy on the bass side - no fault of the ear-buds as I was able to adjust EQ on the iPhone and they responded just fine. Again, great product!!

CANNOT BEAT THESE PERIOD!  (Set the EQ on your device!!!)


I never write reviews but I had to for these. I've spent over $200 for headphones that don't sound even close. I like all the nice little perks but sound is my main goal for headphones (go figure). I literally have them on right now and I've gone through all my Spotify genres from heavy metal to techno.  Classical to ambient and everything. These things are blowing my mind. When I first put them on I thought they sucked. THIS IS KEY-- SET YOUR EQ TO THE DESIRED SOUND!!!!!!!  If you have the wrong eq on your device they won't sound good at all!  Eq it to your taste and you will not be sorry. And for the price???? I mean come on.

Excellent quality, super ergonomic headset


Excellent pair of headphones, extremely flexible and comfortable feel  yet durable. Sound quality is very good and voice pickup from the mic is much better than other headsets. Pushing the multifunction button presses the earbud a bit hard into the eardrum but you can compensate by holding it out with your other fingers.

Best deal for headphones ever


These are legitimately the best deal on the internet for headphones. My dad has a $200 pair of bose wireless headphones and these top those in every sense. They stay in the ear great, and the hook is extra insurance so you don't have to toggle them at all, even when sprinting all out. The noise cancelling is great too, as it really does drain out background noise. Quality seems amazing but I'm not an audiophile and don't really care/cant' tell the difference between great and amazing sound quality anyway. Overall, these are a steal, and are better than most $100+ headphones out there.

I recently purchased a SENSO ActivBuds Bluetooth Headphones and it is excellent. It has all the features I was looking for. All controls are on the right earbud and it connects to my iPhone quickly with very clear stereo sound and absolutely no noise. It is very light, fits in my ear and very nice to wear. I use it to listen to music as I go for a walk and I really enjoy the very clear music in my ears. The battery stay long. The only thing I would say is that when I set the volume on SENSO and on my iPhone to lowest to hear, the sound is a little laud for my ears and I wish I could bring the volume still  lower. It is an excellent gadget and I very highly recommend it. In fact, I am planning to purchase another set and send it to my son as a gift.

A solid buy


These headphones have an amazing battery life and sound great. The bass is great compared to most other Bluetooth headphones. The case is nice and small so it's easy to carry around. The one negative thing I can say about these is that I haven't had the best experience when using them for running. They tend to slowly come loose, they don't fall out but you have to keep adjusting them. Given that I'm not a runner, however, and that I hardly ever run this isn't much of a downside for me.

Fantastic Bluetooth earbuds. At three months, I have had absolutely no issues with this product. These earbuds do produce (more than) ample bass, so I moved to a streaming music provider that offered an Equalizer which allowed me to fine tune the frequencies. Very happy with this product and it's performance.

eeeh, so so


what other reviews said about sound break up is accurate. doesn't do it constantly but regularly.  i have enjoyed the freedom that they give you when used to dealing with holding your phone all the time.  I have used them for one week and the cover of the left ear bud fell off.  didn't notice it had fallen off until i took them off after work.  I am in the process of trying to find replacement parts or returning them.  will probably look at a different brand if i return them.  The pairing process was very easy and consistent every time I turned them on. Did not own them long enough to give accurate battery life info.  the charge lasted as advertised but i know that decreases as time goes on, as mentioned in other reviews.

Awesome !


Can't complain at all about these amazing headphones. I run a lot and these stay put, no matter what. I am very impressed with their sound quality, the overall quality of the product itself and the ease of use! Straight out of the box they connected immediately to my phone and I was off. Not once have they fallen out of my ears or failed to work. All the buttons for FF, volume, RW and ON/OFF are all located on one side and all you have to do is press and hold to FF/RW or press once to turn the Volume Up or Down.....SIMPLE! The overall sound is perfect and these things get Loud!! I only ever use them on less than half volume. They are extremely ""sound proof"" as you hear virtually nothing other than the music playing, however, I would recommend if you are in a busy public area that you are aware of your surroundings i.e. Traffic and it's dangers or on a secluded trail i.e. Stranger Danger as you will not hear anything.....personally I take one ear bud out to allow for other surrounding sounds to be more audible when in either of the aforementioned situations. Another plus: you can have a perfectly clear phone conversation on these.....it will pause your music and continue playing once you hang up the call. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting a decent sound with out paying a fortune to enjoy. Worth every penny, win win!!!

These are pretty nice ear buds, but not so much for exercising. They have tons of wind noise, I think from overactive noise cancellation, even when moving at running at low speed, and gets really annoying on a bike.  A much more minor issue is that the notifications are way too frequent when the battery is low.

I bought these headphones and they worked great for a couple of months. Then the sound stopped in the left ear. I contacted support via chat on their webiste, and they got right back to me.  They had me try a hard reset, and the left ear bud still didn't work. So they went right ahead and sent me out a new pair through Amazon that I received in a couple of days. So major points for good service. The new ones seem to work well, but I've only had them a couple of days, so we'll see. My only other issue is that I have really small ears, and they don't always stay in my ears, but that is an issue I've had with every pair of ear buds I've ever used.

I had to write thia review because if a headphone works ok after it gets washed in washer machine and six months of daily use when working out, Well done guys this is my top headphone, I only wish if you can make one that can work with multiple devices at the same time, it will be awesome

Excellent sound and bass!


Excellent ear buds for the price. The connect easily to blue tooth and came with multiple ear buds including memory foam ones that block sound and fit perfectly in my ear. The silicone ear hooks are super soft and comfortable as well. The bass is surprisingly deep!

Dead after 2 months


I often use wireless headphones at the gym and when running outdoors. So I thought these will be great because of the lasting battery time and being sweatproof. I like the form factor and the battery life. But now, just 2 months after my purchase, they simply died. I charge them and the blue light comes up, but when I try to turn them on, they simply will not respond.

SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is wonderful


SENSO Bluetooth Headphones are comfortable and the sound quality is wonderful. No static, no sounds from cords (the only cord is the connecting cord that you place behind your neck). I leave my smartphone in my bedroom to recharge and listen to my audible books while cleaning house! Great reception! I'm very satisfied!

I was surprised at the sound quality and at such a great value. It also is vary well built stays out of the way when you work out and stays in your ear. I have had other sport Bluetooth headsets befor but I can say these are promising to be the best I've ever had and used. And they are not expensive. It truly is a five star product.

Easy to pair


Easy to pair.  Great sound.  I use it to connect to my smart TV.  Listening to movies is life like sound as it should be.  Amazing how it simulates my sound bar on the TV.  The price you pay is great compared to the higher priced and not very good earbuds.  This is as good or better than my Sony over the ear head phones and it was one seventh the cost.  Noise canceling feature could be better, but it also works as well as my expensive head phones do.  So far, I am very happy.  Oh yea, very comfortable fit on the ear.  Just make sure you try all the earplugs furnished so it fills right for your own ear.  Will try to update later after a couple months of use.

These are great headphones! Battery life is longer than I expected, which is a nice bonus. The case is great for protecting them in my bag, which is what keeps killing my other headsets. Only disappointment (and it is really small) is that the ear hooks are not adjustable in any way, so if they don't fit your ear, you're out of luck. They're flexible and easy to move, but not particularly useful for small ears.

Excellent headset. Only reason it didn't get 5 full stars is due to the part that wraps around your ears. I have tiny ears so they do not wrap on my ears. However, I work out every day and these have not fallen out my ears once. For the money, these are great!  Yes I would buy again.

At first I really liked these headphones. They come with a car charger and seem to have good build quality. However, these headphones are terrible if you use them while you are active.

The sound also cuts out and there is a lot of background noise. Do not buy.

These were actually a very impressive purchase. I bought these to go jogging with my dog but I ended up using them for when I go work outside for a lawn care business spent 3 hours in pouring rain running a weed eater and these headphones are still just as good as when I first got them. I've been able to get a total of about 12 hours out of the better and the controls are very easy to use when out working plus it really muffled out the sound of all the stuff when were out mowing. My only complaint is that the sound quality is not as perfect as the rest of the features these thing have to offer.

Good fit, inexpensive!


I would highly recommend these headphones.  I did not want to spend a ton of money on wireless headphones but wanted something that would not fall out while I run.  These completely fit the bill.  It took me a few tries to find which ear buds fit my ears (they give you several sizes and I found I needed one size for one ear and another size for my other ear).  They are very comfortable and I barely know they are even in my ears while I am running.  The sound quality is good enough for me - I was not looking for anything like Bose, just something that sounds good, fits my ears, won’t fall out while I am running and did not cost too much money.

Good headphones


I decided on these for a few reasons. The different sized ear adapters, the carrying case, and the price compared to other blue tooth headphones. I've owned and tried several pair of headphones but never a blue tooth set like this.Pros-The sound has been great for the 3 weeks or so that I've had them. Really crisp and clear sound and you even get the bass.Battery lasts quite a long timeEasy to turn on and off and connect to my phoneComfortable to wearCons-The piece that goes around the ear is way too flexible so they aren't all that secure when I'm trying to workout. They don't fall out a lot, just when I'm not careful. However, I will disclose that I have small ears and have yet to find a good set that will stay on. So, it MAY just be my ears. But I really don't like how flexible they are. It almost seems like a pointless feature in my opinion.Over all though, I'm happy with them. The smallest adapter it comes with has the best fit I've found so far. With the previous sets I've had (cheapies from Target, nothing too fancy online) the smallest are still too big so I can never seem to get them into my ear enough to stay and often will hurt after not that long of wearing. These are pretty comfortable and the fact that it actually fits in my ear canal helps them stay put.

Great earbuds with a couple of poor design decisions.


I commute to work on my bicycle every day and go to the gym every day. So, I listen to these a lot.Pros:No annoying parts that go around your neckLight weightI like the part that wraps around my ears. Makes it so they don't fall off when doing bench press or crunches.Good quality sound.Cons:Poor battery life. I guess that is to be expected with the size of these.Having to hold down the button for 2 seconds to change the song. When I'm riding my bike I don't want to have to hold it down for that long. Also, I listen to a lot of podcasts. The app I use allows me to skip 30 seconds ahead by hitting the next song button. In other words, you can skip through the ads. Super pain in the butt to hold it for 2 seconds. I just want to hit the button once. It is this way because the button is shared between the volume and song change. Resolution: put the next song button on the left side.When pausing songs it takes a good 1 - 2 seconds to pause. So, if someone tries to talk to me they see me hit the button and then start talking. I have to stop them and tell them I didn't hear them or just take off the earbuds.Earbud tips don't make the best seal in my ear. So, when riding my bike I get a lot of wind noise. I will be buying third party tips to help resolve that.Overall, I really like these. My cons list my look lengthy, but I would still buy these again.

Not impressed


I took a chance and ordered these blind having never heard of the brand. I can honestly say I'm not impressed with them at all. I'm about ready to return them for a refund and buy something else. If I would have paid MSRP I would be pissed not that I'm all that happy at 40. So what's the problems?The ear buds have a rubber band that wraps around your ear. The things are floppy and serve no real purpose. They don't hold the ear buds is place. They tend to slide off while walking, working, etc. Even a thin bendable wire would have helped.The wire has two ties so you can adjust the wire to not dangle. With or without them rubber coated wire catches your skin or clothes and rips the ear buds loose or out.The sound is not THAT great or loud. Bass comes through distorted and highs, mids come through kinda tinny at times. Noise cancelling? Ok sure I didn't notice at all. Blocked outside noise like standard earbuds.. not at all. I've honestly had pairs of skullcandy's that blew these away sound wise. And I only paid 10 for those.Bluetooth is shotty at best. I have paired them to 3 Samsung phones, 2 laptops, a home stereo and a tablet. Only paired to so many devices to test & everytime the Bluetooth would drop in and out constantly. I could put the phone right on the earbud next to my head and it would still drop out. I thought maybe the battery was not fully charged. So I let them charge overnight. Had a full blue light & tried again with the same results.The only good things about them is they look nice, come with a compact carry case, wires and a charger. Cant comment on battery life. Couldn't listen to music cutting in & out for 10 hours straight to find out.In the end not impressed & dissapointed. I will return them and more than likely avoid senso in the future.

Big fan of the headphones for the price. I actually loved them soo much i got a second pair. I use one in the office when i want to zone people out. I have a home pair that I use on runs, working out, jumping rope. They are fantastic. Pros: Battery life is about 8hrs, $17!, easy to connect, show battery on my phone. Con/Neutral: The band that goes around your ear is a bit too bendy. This is not necessarily a bad thing,  but i wish it was a little stiffer. I would definitely recommend these.

Difficult to keep on


I ordered these to replace a set from mpow jaws.  It is advertised as light weight and comfortable.  I am glad the parts that go over each ear are flexible and comfortable.  I usually use them  with only one ear bud in, they often fall off because the weight of the other ear bud pulls the one inserted out.  I have found that sticking the unused earbud in my shirt over my shoulder will hold it in place better, but I think there should be a better solution.

Very good for running, if not too windy


I do not like earbuds, and I actually like these.  Impressed with sound quality.This is my first Bluetooth wireless headphones, so it took a few attempts to figure out how to set up and use - like 10 minutes.  Used the small tips - default tips were way to big for me.  With the small tips these are very comfortable.Never falls out of my ears, and I use these for jogging outside, as well as working out in a gym.No chafing, so no chafing either from the loops over the ears.Controls are excellent. Easy to use while running.Con - increases the sound of Wind blowing over my ears. I do mean increases, taking the earbuds out and the noise dies away. So running outside can sometimes be annoying.  Any strong wind and I cannot hear anything but the roar of the wind.

Great for running (and every day life)! I love them!


These headphones are great!! The battery lasts really long and they are super comfortable. I've use them for half marathon training and never had an issue during any of my long runs. They don't drain my phone's battery either. I was hesitant to get over-the-ear headphones, but they are flexible and soft and stay put and my ears got used to them after the first use.The sound and bass quality is perfect, they really create that sense of being immersed in the music/sound. They are perfect for running. I once forgot to charge them before a distance run (my fault, not the headphone's fault) and my old backup pair of wired headphones didn't even compare! They also connect easily to my computer, which allows me to watch Netflix and I multitask doing chores or crafts. They have a wide range too. I'll charge my phone in the living room and am able to continue listening as I work around the house. It's only until I leave the house and go to the far end of the garage that they disconnect, but they come back immediately when I'm back inside.These pair immediately and overall very easy to use. The controls are great and it's easy to skip around through my playlist and control the volume while running. I like the freedom of the wireless bluetooth controls and appreciate not having to pull my phone out in the middle of a run. I've taken phone calls on them without any issues and they automatically pause the music, tell me what number is calling, and restart the music once the call ends.Other things to note: they're lightweight and hang around your neck when not in use and I like that they came with a little case for safe keeping. I think they look pretty cool too, similar to some name brand over the ear earbuds.Also, Senso/Invotek have FANTASTIC customer service and really stand by their warranty. I definitely recommend both the headphones and the company. I can't wait to run my upcoming half marathon with these keeping me motivated!

Sweet headphones for the price


Just received my headphones the other day. They arrived securely packaged and well before the delivery window closed. After charging, they were easy to pair with my iPhone. They are comfortable and stay in the ear. It did take a while to learn the controls because the buttons are multifunctional, but they do work the way the instructions indicate. As for the sound, they sound good, but I wish they had more bass. For the price, though, these headphones are well worth every penny. Hopefully, they will last a long time.

As of now they seam fine. They are much larger than I thought they would be but they fit well. I wear prescription glasses so they have to go over the glasses over the ear.

Great Quality for Price


These are great for the price!  I use my Beats Solo 3's at the gym and wanted something comparable for my outdoor runs, but without the $300+ price tag.  These fit that bill!  They sound great and stay put!!  Would order again and again.

Great quality at a good price


There are several things I like about this product. To name a few: long lasting battery, cheap, good sound quality, different ear tip attachments, and easy to use. The come with a 1 year warranty as well incase anything does go wrong. They are quick to respond if anything does go wrong and replace head phones as soon as you do your part of the process. I will be buying these headphones again in the future if the current ones I have ever fail me and suggesting to friends as well.

Highly recommended for weightlifting and running


Awesome headphones! I previously had $70 headphones that would always fall out of my ears. These ones look and fit nicely and never fall out during weight lifting or running. The mic works well; my friend was even able to hear me clearly during my outside run. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the sound quality. It's great but it's not perfect for the music I listen to (metal/ hard rock). That's just being picky though. These headphones are so good that after I lost my first pair, I immediately ordered a second replacement. High recommended.

I LOVE the sound quality! The noise cancellation is great and I actually can only wear one headphone in the office otherwise I don't hear people come up behind me.

Initially really liked this product


Initially really liked this product.  The sound was quite good, on par or better with my powerbeats 2 to be honest. Fit was okay. However after a week and a half, they would not power on. All I'm left with is the charging indicator LED on, but they will not turn on. Pretty disappointed considering they sounded good and were perfect for workouts. Haven't had luck contacting the seller.

Great quality but too loud even on the lowest setting.


Great quality sound but volume is too loud even at the lowest setting on my computer and phone. Unfortunately on an Apple device there’s no way of adjusting volume at the lowest setting without sacrificing the quality of the sound. I’m afraid of damaging my hearing so I rarely use these.

Good sound quality, comfortable, and does not fall off during workout.


This is one of the better ones that I had tried ever since my original Moto ones broke. The headphone stays on during work out, and it's comfortable because the ear loop is soft rubber that sometimes you don't even feel that it's there. The sound quality is also on the better side too. So I purchased this second pair for my wife.

These headphones work really well and are comfortable. I used them for running and working out, but also they came in handy because they seem to boost audio volume considerably. This was good for videos and lectures I watched that were hard to hear.After working perfectly for about 11 months, when the battery died one day, the headphones wouldn't recharge or come back on. However, I contacted customer service and they were true to their ""Hassle Free 1 year warranty,"" and sent me a replacement right away!

Comfortable, Loud, 8 hours of battery, and terrific support


I usually run the battery down on headphones in a day or two between running, walking and yard work.  I have gone through a dozen headsets in the past couple of years and these are the best I have found for my needs at any price (the Plantronics Backbeat Fit is close, but 2x the price).  First, they are comfortable and stay on while running.  They are as loud as I would want them.  I run them until I get the battery warning and it usually takes 7-8 hours, excellent for the size/weight.  Support is excellent too (see below).If you start having trouble connecting or holding a connection to your phone, reset the headset.  Here are the instructions from Senso:1. Reset the Senso headphone to factory settings (while plugged into a power source, press/hold the power button for 7 seconds).2. Unplug the headphone from charging cable and power them on.3. Enter the earbuds into the pairing mode and follow instructions for connecting.Also, the headphones may not connect to your devices after you perform the reset. The previous connections that you had established between the headphones and your devices become ""obsolete"" after the reset and needs to be re-configured. In order to do that, please `Forget the Device` on your mobile phone for the Senso headphones and try pairing again. In your Bluetooth settings on your phone, you will see all detected Bluetooth devices. Click on the Senso ActivBuds option and click on Forget this Device. Next pair your headphones to your mobile device once again as shown in the instructions manual.This has fixed the two connection issues I have had with the headset, which occurred after about 100 hours of use.

Already broken


I loved these headphones more than anything. Then today, I was telling my friend to buy them while I was using them at the gym because they were the best things ever, and then they stopped working. I've tried everything as I thought the battery had just died but they won't turn off or on, the indicator light's don't work. And nothing happens when I plug them in to charge! I've tried the car charger, a wall charger, and my computer and nothing! I'm super bummed because these were my favorite headphones to use at the gym! I would love if I could have a replacement pair or something so I could reevaluate my review of this product.

Great headphones for the money These are really good headphones ...


TLDR: Great headphones for the moneyThese are really good headphones that perform for their intended uses. The ear clips are light and conform to your ears. Audio is really good and clear during music and phone calls. The buttons are easy to use even during intense running. The case is a nice touch for carrying the headphones for the gym and traveling. The only small qualm I have about these is that the string sticks to my neck when I sweat a lot during high cardio exercise.My old headphones died recently, and customer service was very responsive and quick to send a replacement.

Nowhere near the quality of my Powerbeats Wireless


I have had my Powerbeats wireless headphones for about 3 years now and they have been amazing. Unfortunately, they took a trip through my washing machine recently and didn't make it to the other side still functioning. Instead of spending another $200 on the same headphones, I did some research and found these to look almost the exact same online and figured the quality might be similar since there were so many amazing reviews and the number of reviews was so high. When I went to put them on I noticed the part that goes over the ear to be very flimsy and unstable, making it a little more difficult to put on. The earbud part seemed to fit in my ear fine. When I tried to use them on a video chat call, the person on the other end said they could barely make out what I was saying and that there was a lot of static. After turning them off and switching to wired headphones for my voice call, I tried to listen to music on them and the sound quality was crap. I also used these in my house and had my phone in one room and when I went into the other rooms of my house, the headphones started losing connection like they were out of range. I don't have a big house and this hasn't ever happened with my Beats.  Maybe I am forever ruined because I know how well Beats did their product and how well they worked for everything I needed them for or maybe my expectations were too high but for as much as I need these type of headphones for, I will be spending another ridiculous amount of money to have beats again. These headphones are in a box ready to go back to wherever they came from.

Don't waste your money on these


They're a bit bulky and don't fit into human ears very well; they're uncomfortable if you're wearing them for a long time. More importantly, just days after the window to return them closed, the battery quit. It will no longer charge. The first time I charged it, the connection was a bit difficult to get seated properly but it seemed to do alright. Now it doesn't matter how firmly the cord is connected, it simply doesn't charge. This happened suspiciously close to the return date. Don't waste your money on these.

great sound quality


First of all, fully charged and ready to go out of the box so I was able to test them out immediately. I bought this pair based on the reviews so here's my 2 cents: great sound quality, sits in ear comfortably and won't fall out even without the ear hook, simple controls, paired with my iPhone 6 immediately, microphone worked just fine in the wind.I mainly got these for running and I haven't been disappointed. The cord doesn't bounce up and down on my neck while I'm out and the sound cancelling is pretty impressive. In fact, be careful if you're running along busy roadways, I can't even hear other dogs barking at my dog when we pass their fence.Overall, easy 5 stars and the 1 year warranty is automatic upon purchase.

Very nice package, the product is with high quality, problem after 8 months


Very nice package, the product is with high quality.  There's extra car charger to charge both iPhone and Android phone with additional charging cables.  The sound quality is pretty good with crispy high notes and strong base notes.  I like the sweat proof feature.The reason I give it 3 star is for the wind noise when I run.  I think it's because it's design not as streamline as the others I used before, the wind noise is very much noticeable.  This is very disappointing.I switched out to use different ear tips, it doesn't resolve the wind noise issue.  Even if I turned off the unit, and run with it hang in my ear, the wind noise is still there loudly.  So this is definitely a design issue on the shape.  Because it's not worth pay for the return & shipping back, I will keep it to use in the office only.I end up purchase the Phaiser BHS-530, similar price, also water/sweat proof, but much less wind noise.  The Phaiser's shape is more streamline, so less wind resistance I guess.--- Update December 2017I used this weekly running outside or in the gym.  After running for 20 minutes, the volume of the music will go lower, this wasn't the problem a couple months ago.  Maybe the battery is getting week?  Leave it as 3 stars since the piece is not dead yet.

Awesome headphones ... for 5 months


Used this mainly as my running / gym pair of headphones.  They work really well for staying in your ear, drowning out background noise, and decent voice quality.  My complaint though is they only lasted 4 months before it started getting loose wire connections at the base of the headphone (where it connects to the other earphone)... now the sound basically jumps around and is unusable :(.  Really liked the pair but they should have lasted way longer; I am not rough on my products.

Everything (Sound quality and battery) was great for the first few days. Then the battery just stopped charging. Couldn't even do a factory reset. Dead and waste now. I don't recommend this product.

These are nice earphones, I'm no audiophile and only listen to ...


You can order else without any worry at all, if you don't like them it's not a problem because customer service is stellar. The sound is good from what I can tell (not an audiophile) the battery life is 7-8 hours. So they are was advertised but what they don't tell you is a lot of other ear buds in this price range seem to offer no support after you buy them. I bought one pair with the big warranty symbol on the page and I couldn't figure how or where to get help.With these help is never a problem., you really can't go wrong the customer service is just too good.

Sound good, but don't fit in my ears that well


I like these headphones and they are quite comfortable to wear and work well. But they don't fit totally in my ears so they are not really noise cancelling. It means I have to turn up the volume with whatever I'm listening too. I have been using them in the gym while I'm working out.

These are a good value and sound great for the price, however they began to constantly drop the Bluetooth, and it tells you "" disconnected"" and then ""connected"". It is getting annoying. It had been to months and I have an iPhone 7+., to clarify - it disconnects when my phone is in my hand or in my pocket and the headphones are on my ears.

My old Bluetooth headphones finally stopped working on me after about 3 years so I bought these after reading some reviews. They sound clearer and last about 2 hours more than my old ones (~8 hours vs. ~6 hours). I still don't like the way they fit because of the loops but they're good enough.

Wont work in left pocket


The sound quality is great, but not very ""bass-ey."" Also, it only works if your phone is in your right pocket. I normally keep mine in my left pocket and as I walk, when the phone is at the furthest point across my body it cuts off on the headphones. I mostly notice this when i walk outdoors, it seems to be a non issue indoors. It proves to be an issue when I run. It should be noted that I'm only 6 ft tall. So if you are taller, it may be a greater issue for you.

This is an excellent product! I couldn't be happier with the price and quality of these headphones.

Good enough.


They sound alright, no complaints.  My biggest issue is the functionality. The power button is in a location where every time you push the right piece into your ear, you turn the set off.  Then I grab the edges and push the volume buttons. So basically, my right ear piece keeps falling out.

Great if you aren't a woman with small ears.


I got these because I work in an office that's noisy, and I didn't have much luck with the other Bluetooth headphones I purchased (a bit snug around the neck, some microphone noise). These were reasonable at first - charged well, fit OK (although if you have small ears, don't bother - the silicone clips are too big and the boxy bodies of the headphones are painful after a few minutes). The sound quality, if they fit you, is really good - I listened to everything from Cindy Lauper to Seal on my 80's mix and the sound quality was amazing. Even a few folk, pop, and country tracks I tried were good, and the voice fidelity is good for audiobooks.Much to my dismay, they are going back. Why? That big boxy ear piece. I have small ears even for most women, and after about an hour wearing them I had to start fiddling with them to keep my ears from throbbing. If they were in the right position for sound, they were awful for comfort, and vice-versa. I also noticed that they changed my ringtone (in my earpiece at least) and read out the number calling - fine if you like that, but I get so many junk calls at work that I have my ringer off for most calls and I don't need to hear their numbers as I send them to voicemail.

Update review


These headphones lasted me 2 years and 3 months , they got used about 4 times a week. They have stood up against rain and sweat. This is the longest a pair of headphones has lasted for me , and they are the least expensive.I had to order a new pair of these head phones because my old ones stopped working.  Unfortunately, this time, I only got about 4 or 5 uses out of them. They wont even turn on anymore. They also changed the way they fit around your ear which i dont like. Very disappointing.

I just got these today and I played a few songs, honestly they're great. The arch keeps the buds in my ear and the sound is clear and good quality. Even better is I simply love that the box came with a phone mount, caribiner clip, a stick on card holder for a phone, and what I love most is the case. It has mesh inside for the spare rubber buds (thank you!) And even the case itself. It's a nice carbon fiber finish with red accents. Awesome product so far!

Not worth the hype


I have only used these headphones a few times and the piece inside the earpiece that connected to the charger is broken. The cord itself had a hard time fitting in and that's probably what did it. So they are useless now since they can't be charged.They were decent to use, but all the adjustable ear pieces it comes with, hurt quite a bit.Hate to say it but they were actually a waste of money. Did not last long at all and they weren't that comfortable.

Cut the cord, you'll never go back.


I wanted to use the headphones for a couple of weeks before I posted a review. I have always used wired headphone, so I can only compare them to those. I had never considered getting wireless headphones until I saw a guy using them on the machine next to me. Needless to say he had nothing but good to say about the very expensive brand he had. He said they eliminated the wire getting in the way problem while working out. I knew exactly what he was talking about, having recently broken my wired set by accidentally pulling the cable out at a weird angle. I decided to bite the bullet and was immediately hit by sticker shock. After doing my due diligence I found the highly rated SENSO headphones on Amazon. Not wanting to spend big bucks for the name on the product I decided to give them a shot.After reading the manual I was able to quickly get them tied into my phone.I tried all three earbuds deciding on the most comfortable set that also cut out the most background noise.Working out at the club is so much more enjoyable now that there are no wires in the way.Sweat does not seem to adversely affect them, though my ears don't sweat all that much.I can fully focus on what I am doing and not on ""are the wires in the way"".I decided to use them at work to cut out coworker noise and play some background music.Again they worked like a charm. Due to acoustics in our office, I used to be able to hear coworkers more than 3 doors away, I don't hear them anymore.I don't notice any difference in the sound quality between these and the wired units I used to use.I can highly recommend SENSO headphones for anyone on a budget who wants to cut the cord.I won't ever use wired ear buds again.I am next going to see if I can get them to work with a Bluetooth adapter for my ham radio.

What just happened.


If I had written a review at any point between their arrival and 7/15 I would have given them 4 stars (great battery, great sound, doesnt come out fo the ear, poor mic - based on feedback during calls and if you turn your head sideways and the phone is in the pocket, you lose connection). However on 7/15 they just quit and died for no reason at all, they showed a full charge on the phone, everything was working normally and out of nowhere they switched off (no warning or anything) figured maybe the battery died. Put it on charge, never got the charging light. Left it for a couple of hours and tried to turn it back on, it did not.Edit: After working with Customer Service, which was really quick and easy, they sent out a new headset. So far things are great again, so I have changed my rating from a 1 star to 4.Edit: After having these headphones for nearly a year, they quit working i.e. they no longer charge. The pair I currently have 10% remaining and I dont expected to here sound again after they die since I cant charge them :(. Took 1 star off cause this shouldnt have happened?

Got these for the wife for Christmas.  She loves the way they feel and sound.  She gets no distortion even when she turns them up high enough to block me and the kid out.  She's been picky about the way ear buds have felt before, but the size options that came included and general designed have worked perfectly for her.  I'd recommend for sure.

Good audio quality but poorly made


Great quality headphones with a good battery life. The one bad thing is that the ware down fairly quickly. After about 6 months of perfect use, the physical quality of the headphones started going down. First, the moveable peice to go over the ears began to tear to the point of eventually falling off. Second, the wiring of the headphones popped out of the plastic covering. And lastly, one earpiece literally fell out and does not work anymore. After reading that these headphones have a 12 month warranty I attempted to contact Senso several times they email and phone call but for no response back. At this point I don’t know what else to do except contact Amazon now.

Do NOT buy if you plan to use them to run/walk/even walk.


Like other reviews have mentioned the product includes a TON of accessories for the price, but its not useful because the base product was awful.With most headphones there is a little bit of wind noise but these sound like someone has a leaf blower next to your ear. On top of that after an hour run I took out the headphones and my ears ached for several hours after taking them out. I may have had a defective product because the connectivity was awful as well.

Before buying these headphones i bought the beats studio 3 and a pair of power beats only to return them. These by far out do the name brand headphones i have tried. Way better sound quality. They stay to my ears during high movement exercises. I really like that they tell you power on, bluetooth activated and power off. This helps me remeber to turn them off. I am quick to disconnect bluetooth then keep the headphones on but with the voice reminder they havent died on my yet. For the price i can say they arent cheap quality and are woth the money.

Rather tinny noise comparative to sets that are just 40 dollars more.  If you're looking for a cheap workout pair, these fit the bill, but if you're looking for sound quality then you might seek elsewhere.  For the price, I'd say grab them as your ""I don't care about these"" option.

My youngest son “borrowed” my moderately expensive (over $200:00) headphones so I went on the hunt for a less expensive replacement.  I read the reviews on the Senso’s and figured for the price these were worth a shot.  Safe to say that the positive reviews on these headphones are accurate.  The tone quality is excellent.  They’re easy to pair and comfortable to wear.  I will not miss my old bulkier headphones.  Thank you Senso.

Can't turn them down.


They're loud. Some may not think that's a bad thing, until they need to turn them down. On an iPhone you have to have at least 3 boxes of volume before they work, you go any lower than that, they'll beep and switch off. Sometimes stuff is uncomfortably loud and you just have to deal with it.

But you need to adjust the bass in order to make it sound better (The base is extremely heavy when you first listen). The earbuds seem to fit my ears quite well. All in all, an excellent value.

Good stuff, carries sound about 35' from my laptop.  Love the dual charger (mini USB and Lightning) concept.-1 star because the ""low battery"" warning gives you about 5 minutes notice.  Not sure how long a full charge lasts... if I had to guess it's about 5-6 hours.

It's great for what price I paid!! Comfortable and looks awesome. The sound is very nice but the only con about this product is the battery life as compared to my other wireless Bluetooth headphones. It will work for like continuous 7-10hrs but soon you have to charge them. Overall, I will definitely recommend them.

Pretty good!!


Wow, great headphones! These are very comfortable to wear for long periods with no ear hot spots from the over ear support or the contact points anywhere else. Sound quality is very good for the price, well worth the bills. I haven't tested them for sweat durability yet, but summer is coming, and here in TX they will be tested.We could go through the tech stuff but that is really only to impress friends and family you probably want to know the major points: how do they sound, how long does the battery last, how well do the functions work. I am pleased to report everything has performed as promised. You can spend a great deal of time researching for the best headphones, I had been looking for a while, it really came down to several factors for me, reviews and price. I am satisfied with my choice, I think you will be also, just move to the buy now button and just do it. Enjoy!

... had them a few days but they are the best sounding earbuds I've had


I've only had them a few days but they are the best sounding earbuds I've had. They are comfortable in the ear and lightweight. The controls are on the earbuds themselves, not like some that have them on the wire which then pulls on the earbuds. I have no problems with them when walking my dog mowing the lawn so far.  I have not run with them or biked yet with them but I do not see an issue arising doing those activities. Well worth the money.

Good earbuds on design, quality and sound considering the price. If you love deep bass like the one comes from Bose or Beats, these are not the ones.

Great product but lack in the Bass sound


Had the product for a couple of days now and have been using it often. Purchased the product because of review and wanted something to run with. Physically I find the product excellent and the additional cables with iPhone car charger and the portable storage is really nice. I love the fact when you turn it on a voice prompt you it is on. Also a voice tells you when it is connected to your phone instead of a kind of beep, I find that is a nice touch. Sound quality is good and taking a call is also good. My biggest disappointment is the bass. If you love bass this is not the product for you. Other wise overall the product is great.

Sound is great, but I have to adjust during running and the brand is very popular in my neck of the woods and have seen / talked to others and it's not perfect, but very good.

• The earbuds are slightly too large (I use the smallest size on the (excellent) 
Symphonized GLXY Premium Genuine Wood In-ear Noise-isolating Headphones with Mic and Nylon Cable (Ebony)

The high rating is definitely not legitimate


These headphones are AWEFUL! These headphones are a total gimmick. They give you a lot of accessories to distract you from the overall poor quality. First, the sound quality is awful so they compensate with extra base. Second, none of the ear bud sizes fit. Third, the over ear loops were so big and awkward they didn't even touch my ears or prevent the head phones from falling out. Fourth and finally, they broke in less than a week! Getting these headphones was a waste of time.

Great headphones, especially for the price. I'm not that discerning, but sound quality seems really good to me. However, they're fairly useless as a microphone.

Decent headphones for the price you're paying


Honestly, these headphones aren't that bad for the price you're paying.  They block out sound pretty decently and the sound is decent.  I will say that the headphones have too much bass on them so the music sounds a little muffled.  Also, the headphone thing that keeps them on your ear is built rather filmsy. The Buetooth reception is good too.  I'd recommend this for anyone looking for cheap bluetooth headphones that work well when running long distances.

So far, they're okay.  I must have weird ears, because when I run, they tend to slowly work their way out of my ears.  I have to keep pushing them back in.  When I'm working out, they stay in.  My old earpieces worked great.  They never moved when I ran.  It's nice to not have to worry about the headphone cords getting caught when I'm working out.  I'll give it some time before I give my final word.  3 stars so far.

First off, the good - the sound is very good.  Now the bad - the ear plugs point downward, don't know anyone who has ear canals that point directly down; no matter which extra covering I try the ear bud does not like to stay in, and the very floppy ear holders just are too floppy.  I had wanted a set to wear when I work on my farm, in the rain, snow, sun, etc., these just won't be those.

They have fantastic sound, are super comfortable and stay in place while jogging, assuming your ears are the same size.  Unfortunately I think that my right ear canal is smaller than the left because I've had the same issue with other headphones in the past.  Since I can't get the right one to stay on, this review is based on how the left ear felt.  I would definitely recommend these bluetooth headphones.  In addition to being great headphones the customer service is phenomenal, I received an email from the president asking me if I was happy with the product and if not to let him know so that they could take care of any issues I may be having.

Sounds pretty good and the controls are easy enough to use


I've been through several sweat proof wireless headphones and this is the first pair that has made it for any length of time. **I have now had them several months of frequent use.** I think in part it is because of the placement of the charging port, which is on the underside of the ear bud and mostly stays away from sweat and water.  Sounds pretty good and the controls are easy enough to use.  It holds a charge pretty well too.

They have performed very well, are super comfortable and are a lot lighter than the on the neck Bluetooth headset I have been using on my walks.  I purchased these thinking that because they were inexpensive they probably would be ok, but not great.

Loud but good


I have had these headphones for a few weeks now and I like them. For a relatively inexpensive pair of headphones they're very nice, they're a little too loud though, I wish I could turn the volume down one or two more clicks. This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and the change from a cord is incredible. Also the ability to pause your music/Netflix remotely by tapping the earbud is really useful. These are fairly good at keeping background noise out, they don't block out everything but probably 85-90% of the noise around you. They stay on pretty well too, I normally have issues with apple earbuds falling out but these haven't fallen out unless they've gotten caught on something. I haven't worked out with them yet though, so I can't speak to that. The plastic cover for the charging port did snap off only a few weeks after purchasing however. This was very disappointing because I take very good care of them and have kept them in the carrying case when I'm not using them. I am worried that this will compromise the water resistance of the headphones. All in all they are a decent pair of headphones.

Don't lie about a warranty if you aren't going to go through with it.I am updating this to say that they did do a warranty replacement after a couple of nasty emails.

Great value for the money!


My ONLY complaint would be regarding the cord that goes between the two earpieces.  I found it a bit annoying.  The material that it is made of is a little ""grabby.""  I wonder if they could use a different material that would slide more easily instead of grabbing against clothing?  Otherwise, everything else about this product is great; certainly an excellent value for the money!

Exceptional sound, and superior customer service.


The first pair I bought tended to get warm during use and lasted less than an hour.  I contacted customer service and they shipped another pair to me immediately.The earphones are very comfortable.  The mic works well for phone use and the sound fidelity is well above the average.  You cannot beat these earphones for the price.

Didn't hold up very long.


Well they worked good for walking ,but not so good when hitting tennis balls against a wall. Everytime you'd bend over the music was distorted. 3 months later they stopped talking a charge. I would have made do with them for walking and given a little higher rating if they were still working.

Good battery life


Had for quite a while. Use 3x a week when I workout and sometimes at work. Battery lasts nicely, don't have to worry if I forget to charge it for a couple days. Lasts me about 10 hours of use. They've held up well but the piece covering the charge hole did fall out. To be expected imo given the nature of how I use them.

Bought these about a week ago. Only used for about 3 or so workouts about an hour each they havent needed a recharge even though they have been in my bag (turned off) all week so batttery life is better than my old headphones. Sound quality is mediocre as id expext in this price range. The one thing i would like to inform is that the ear hooks are very flimsy and soft. I was hoping for a firmer tight feel. That being said they havent fallen out yet despite vigourous workout. Best feature is affordability and they offer a pretty good performance per dollar.

Good Deal


My husband loves them.  The other kinds fall out of his ears.  These stay put and have good sound quality.  Great price!

don't waste you're money on expensive headphones these are just as good. They actually fit better too.


These headphones are amazing. The quality you get for the price doesn't even seem right.  I also was not expecting all of the things that came in the box. The value of the other things in the box are worth more than the price you get with headphones included. I've used these headphones only twice so far during my workouts and they are great. I can't hear the annoying gym music and I don't have to have my phone on me to listen to music. Great buy !

Great but with imperfection


Nice audio effect. A little slow when change from wire headphone to this Bluetooth one. There is a 10 second or so delay when I turn on this headphone if another plug-in headphone is working. First it's silence, a weak but high pitch noise, then intermittent sound, and finally full audio.

Good for jogging.


They work great; however when my phone is on the opposite side of my body than the ear phone with the switches, reception is broken.  This was exasperated by a downpour that totally soak me and my clothes.  Also, I seem to have to recharge more often than advertised (not a problem since I’m only use it for morning jogs).

VERY disappointing!


I was VERY unhappy with these headphones! The sound is very good but the Blue Tooth connection is very bad. i tried them on three different devices and found that the slightest movement interrupted the signal, i couldn't put my phone in my pocket without the signal cutting out! I do not recommend this product!

Excellent for the gym


Gave it 4 stars because I don't like Black headphones and they only come in 1 color. Also the ear hook is not adjustable and I have small ears. Other than that they connect easily the range is really good the charge lasts long and extra pieces you get was an unexpected bonus! A must have!

These sound great and I bought 2 because I thought battery might die out quickly. They lasted almost 8 hours everyday. I like the smaller ear inserts than the ones they had on them already. It really comes with a lot of stuff. A cigarette charger, 2 extra wires an an apple charger and a case. It came with a lot for the price.

Better then I expected given the price.


Better then I expected given the price. The packaging is nice, a few extras in the box. The sound quality is good. I had been using the LG headphones, but the quality of those are dropping. While the charge of these doesn't last as long, I think it is less likely that these will break.
