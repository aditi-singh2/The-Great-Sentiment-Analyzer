Absolutely Fantabulas



  First things first!!!!! The no-1 TV Stick in Indian Market...This 3rd Generation Fire TV stick has a superb build quality. The remote has a premium look & feels great in hand. The set-up with TV is just seamless. For normal size TV the HDMI extension cord is not required. If you require, it is inside the box, so not to worry :-)Now coming to the streaming quality. It is wow wow wow.. Dolby Sound quality gives a surround feeling & is great (I have tried this with my Sony 5.1 sound system though). You need to install the apps you want watch, like Hotstar, Zee5, Voot, Disney+, Hoichoi etc etc. etc. The Overall experience with these apps  are really cool. The newly introduced Live section seamlessly connect to LIVE channels via the installed apps.In the Verdict I will suggest if you want to convert your TV in a full house of entertainment & cool features, then you go blindly for this. Its the ultimate TV stick for you.

Bad customer service

You cannot control volume of your Bluetooth device



  It is a really good streaming device . Apps work perfectly fine . You can sideload 3rd party app easily . Remote is fine , voice control is perfect , installation is simple , streaming quality is great.BUT WHY 1 STAR??you cannot change the volume in your Bluetooth headset or airpods which don't have its own volume control . Well i usually watch movies at night while others are sleeping so I prefer using Bluetooth headsets . Whenever I pair it with firestick It always plays at 100 percent and makes my eardrum tear and made me switch off tvThis is a basic function which can be included in a firmware upgrade , but as of 30th June , there is no update regarding this .So yes if this is important for you , u choose other streaming device .Btw i fall in love with their remoteüòç

The customer service execute informed me to buy another Fire Stick and will replace the one one once I purchased a new one. It is more than a week I bought a new fire stick and also informed the CC. Unfortunately there is no feedback from them. The old product was not replaced. Is it a punishment for me to buy your product and I have to pay for a faulty product. Please expedite.

Fairly good needs lot of tinkering



  Connected my airpods to firestick. And the volume doesn't work. Sound is too loud on the ears. Volume decrease on the remote doesn't reduce the volume in the BT airpods. Result sound too loud and jarring. It is shocking that a company of the calibre of Amazon can produce such ridiculous product. High time they come down from their perch of lord and mighty and think of ideas to give customer satisfaction. And on the upside I must say everything else is real good about this firestick

Never thought Amazon would cheat



  I ordered a fire tv stick 3rd gen 2021 during the recent Prime Fest of 26th & 27th July 2021. At the time of ordering the product detail very categorically said that there is a One Year free subscription to Sony Liv, ZEE5 & Voot bundled along with the product. This was in the description section of the product that I ordered, hitch was very promptly delivered to me. Now when I enquired with Amazon helpline about how to activate the free subscription, the customer support denied any offer like this & now I am supposed to pay separately for these subscriptions. How I wish I had taken a screen shot of this & kept with me. At least would have saved myself from the misery of being denied of what was promised to begin with. I don‚Äôt know how that promotion appeared there, could have been a technical glitch on the part of Amazon but I am sure I bought this with the subscription which is now denied. It a shame for Amazon to get so petty & completely disown the responsibility to fulfil their offer. I just feel cheated to the core.

Doesn't Support Voice Search



  The most important thing on which amazon in betraying us is that it doesn't supports voice search. For example alexa button is there but it can only play things on amazon prime video. If u open zee 5 or youtube you will not get the mic button to search and will have to press the assistant button which will take you somewhere else and will not search for things we want. It UI is excellent but this voice search is the main issue. Thats why you should be going for mi stick.

Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen, 2021



  I was forced to buy Firestick 3rd generation after my Amazon Firestick First Generation stopped working. It was working fine till afternoon and after showing Software update in progress, it got stuck and never worked.I called up the Executive and after trying everything was asked to take it to nearby center. As the center is quite far, I didn't go, but ordered the third generation instead.I wrote to Amazon, if they are selling the product, then they should also provide after sales service. They can always charge. No issues.The person should visit home to rectify the problem. Trust me, there have been instances when some Electronics company sent a technician to home, though the equipment was worth only 2000 Rs.And here we are talking about an equipment costing Rs.4000 to Rs. 6000.How can an equipment stop working while updating software, still I can't get it. Is that deliberate so that Customer buys the new version?Not to say, I regret buying the third generation Firestick. It's a great experience. Great sound. It's a marvel. Amazon always had been my first Choice.The only letdown was equipment stopped working during update. Never heard of. Amazon should regard loyalty.Almost Each day, can you believe it, we order something from Amazon. Please check records.

True review



  Quality of the product and packaging is really recommendable. I brought it at a great price of 2799. The stick supports maximum 1080p videos (I tried with my 32inch led). Sound is stereotype. Not tested whether it is dolby digital or not. It supports both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz of internet. Remote is quite handy. Alexa voice responses are recommendable. Interface is attractive and fast. Pairing of remote with the tv is done automatically on first setup and even one can set other consoles by going to add remote option which is available in the fire stick. Remote provided is RF type. One thing I disliked is the pressing of remote buttons. It should be soft press rather than hard press.I would personally suggest to go for it if anyone wish to buy.Thanks for the deal Amazon

  My Sony bravia non-smart tv has in-built Prime and Netflix app and few others but no Disney Hotstar. So I decided to buy this Firestick and ended up with out of the box experience! The picture, audio and streaming clarity this gave was far far better than my tv in-built apps!!!Plugged it in directly to my JBL soundbar which has HDMI-in passthrough rather than connecting to TV which gave crystal clear sound. Have to be patient for the initial setup. After that just relax and binge!! Terrific purchase!! Thank you Amazon for the offer pricing too!

Hardware still feels like there is a ui lag not snappy



  Mi Tv Box 4k at 3500 is still a better deal compared to this it's older than this but it's always been faster than my firesticks in terms of ui navigation.This firestick is not bad it does what it's supposed to do has a new menu system. All major streaming services work but I always feel that there is a slight lag on the user interface Amazon just bloats the home page with so many options I just wish I could just turn off all thr suggestions and that would speed up the ui. I just want to see my apps on the home screen not all the suggestions which is as is slowing down the ui and at the same time overflowing my home page with junk suggestions.

  I am giving this review again after using fire tv stick for the last 1 month. Previously I gave 4 star rating because volume and power buttons were not working due to videocon tv compatibility. But after some days Mr. Naresh(Technician team) called me and forwarded a mail to me for again remote setup and update. So I followed all steps as I received on mail and I am so happy to share my review again that now my fire tv stick is updated and all buttons are working finely.

User friendly and extremely simple to use



  This device is something that I now regret not having bought earlier. Its super easy to use, more so with its voice control feature, which makes tuning into your favourite channel/music/video a breeze. I am using it with my old Sony Led TV (bought in 2011) which does not have internet or bluetooth. The experience is simply amazing. A highly recommended product even for new-age smart TVs because it makes toggling between different OTT providers super easy and fun. The only problem that I am having is connecting the remote to my TV's volume/power controls.Mine is a 3rd Gen, 2021 Firetv and I got it during a flash sale for a good discount @2699/-Tip: Watchout for any sales and jump on the opportunity.

Not compatible with SONY LED Tv



  First I bought fire tv lite stick which worked with SONY LED Tv 2012 model .But felt lite tv stick remote was cumbersome has it did not have volume,power and direct app buttons. Needed multiple remotes for smooth operation. So I went for 3rd generation fire tv stick which had all the buttons on single remote. But 3rd generation stick could not be paired with SONY TV after multiple attempts, changing batteries and lot of trouble shooting. Wish Amazon mentioned the names of Tvs with which this fire tv stick is compatible, it would have saved time and effort.So returned the stick and asked for refund.

  The voice search is bad ,while searching it only gives results realted to Amazon prime video contents and not any other platform even, but when we enter a app and do the voice search it works fine.While connecting a Bluetooth headphone it's volume can't be controlled by the fire tv remote and will be set to maximum volume so can only be changed if the headphone itself has volume control feature.The appstore is that from Amazon itself.And there is limited apps on the Amazon appstore.And also there is no 5.1 sound support even though it does support Dolby digital and digital Plus.The remote is functional and good.For watching live tv except for 2 or 3 free apps paid subscription is required.Edit:- after about 4 to5 months the power adaptor got damaged but  got a new one  under warrenty.

Product is amazing



  Product is awesome. But disappointed with cost.  When i ordered this on 14th june 21, i paid 3999 rs. I wanted another 1 so tried ordering it again saw the price slashed to 3199 rs. Felt looted types. Its not 800rs which are shortcoming, but people boast saying they got it for lesser price which hurts ur ego.Else this is a fantastic product.

Super Fast !!



  Works Great. No issues. The menu navigation is butter smooth. Initially had issue with upgrades during installation. The device simply keeps restarting. However I did a factory reset and tried again. And this time it downloaded and installed the upgrades and went to the setup screen without any problems. Using it on a Epson projector setup with the help of a hdmi splitter. Fire Stick has Bluetooth, so audio is connected to Sony 5.1 speakers Using Bluetooth. Finally true home theater experience.

One of the best piece of hardware that I have ever bought



  This review is for the 2021 version. Got it for ‚Çπ2400 in prime sale. Following is the summary:1. Easy to setup, takes time though (especially for the update(s)).2. Runs on fire OS that is a fork of the Android operating system, so the appstore might not have everything, but you can sideload apps using the debug option (although, not recommended).3. Screencast worked with OnePlus and Mi phones.4. Voice search works on YouTube and other apps, but using mobile to search through on screen keyboard was easier.5. Bluetooth devices work, you can even add game controllers.6. Streaming quality is great even on 1080p, I thought koryo TV's are bad, but this device delivered a great experience.7. Power button and volume buttons are mapped to the TV, the TV remote is useless if you are using Fire Stick, so for volume control and power, you will use this device, and you can tuck away the TV remote for good.

Decide for you‚Äôre self.



  1) cost in India and cost in USA too much  difference2) Hardware wise we need 2gb ram  and 16gb storage as minimum.3) inability to control Bluetooth volume from  fire stick is a deal breaker4) Inability to decode and provide Dolby  atmos via Bluetooth or HDMI is a Real deal  breaker. Should have opted for Nokia  streamer where in it is available.  My Laptop can do headphone Dolby Atmos  by buying the license from Microsoft store.5) Unable to switch off Samsung Dce32  signage display via power button on the  fire stick remote6) unable to select 1080 60hz or 30 hz video  on YouTube if it‚Äôs available when viewing  same video on laptop.

Works like a charm... installation wasn't smooth



  All that was expected - Turned my non-smart tv into an android one. As long as your TV has an HDMI port and supports at least 720p (HD ready) it should work. Otherwise additional gadget may be required.Setup was tricky though. I can understand why some people gave up and returned the product. Here's an advice:1. At first prompt choose eng US as language.2. After filling account details it shows an OTP to register the device. You'll expect an email or a notification in amazon app to provide the OTP. But the email/notification never arrives. This is the frustrating part.3. Go to amazon.com/tv (the instruction appears on screen) from your PC or phone browser to provide the OTP. That's it.4. My firestick kept restarting (rebooting) throughout the setup process and I had to re-start the task many times. I thought mine was a faulty stick. Then I made sure the HDMI connection and power connection were firmly secured (tightened). That solved the problem.

Garbage product - reviewed after 1 year of use



  Worked well out of the box, but performance markedly deteriorated within 3 months. After 6 months, was slow, laggy, unresponsive, and had to press buttons multiple times to recognize input. Drains batteries much more rapidly than other remotes, I need to replace the battery once a week now, and even then it doesn't work. Without doubt the worst, most overpriced purchase I have ever made on Amazon. Please don't be fooled by the positive reviews, most of these are people who are excited about the new product but haven't yet used it for a year.

Best substitute for android box/stick but beware of black home screen fixed by 3rd reset.



  This is the best option to make your hdmi capable tv to smart tv.But after 7days at 18th October 2021, after I start fire tv stick it's home screen goes black. I tried all method like deregistration, restart, factory reset etc but problem still persist.At last 3rd factory reset black screen problem is fixed. Please Amazon fix it by os update.So this problem can't happen again. So this product may not be long lasting.Black home screen problem persist due to slow wifi connection or low ram/cache memory, so don't download too much app. You should save 3gb space to run fire stick normal.

Needs better UI



  Overall a good uswful device but the setup is slow, the remote is extremely unfriendly and without numbers and alphabets typing is a pain. Better to use the mobile remote app of fire tv to navigate.And something not right with hotstar as it gets hidden everytime on the screen.Definitely they need to work on the UI and maybe UX. Pretty average product I'd say with a great marketing and space to be in as a first mover.

First device worked fine till 1yr.After that there was problem with sound, sometime sound goes off and doesn't come back. After some day, remote started giving problem. Frequent disconnect battery drainage etc.I had to replace the old one. You can only buy all Amazon exclusive products on prime day as the price goes lower than expected.New device has new interface, faster screen load, and improved remote. Since far all my existing problem are not seen in new one. Hope this one goes till 2023 so that I can buy 4th gen on prime day, ha ha..

Simple Smooth Streaming Solution



  I have been using it from more than a month and it is performing flawlessly. First thing i liked was perfectly packaged thing. Remote batteries dongle, HDMI adapter, charging brick. Second thing setting up was easy and full of information and text. The remote controls the TV as well On/OFF my VU TV was listed and there were almost all brands of TV available even the names which you might have never heard off.  Easy to install and the DONGLE is dual band can receive 5G and 2.5G wifi network. Streaming is super smooth no lags. The device itself is very powerful compared to the new  budget smart TVs that have a low RAM/ Speed processor. So surfing channels and using Alexa is breeze. Overall i would highly recommend to get this thing if you have a smart TV,Now all you need is just the remote plus everything hides behind the TV so no one can ever tell that the TV is non smart and has been converted :) For a full videos review you can check youtube video on my channel lightsky motion Pictures

Dhoom Dhamaka Product



  I have given a five star but will start from sad part. First I purchased firestick plus with zee5, voot and Sony LIV subscription. I got the delivery in 4 days. I signed in with my credentials. Everything worked super fine. The remote paired at first attempt itself. I was dilkush. But this wasn't last for long. I downloaded all files and checked pre subscribed packs. But the fate is it wasn't subscribed. Was asking to purchase it again. I contacted Amazon customer care. They gave few tips which doesn't seem to working with me. So I thought to return it and purchase without subscription (I could have kept it but since I paid 1k extra and was no use, thought of returning it). I ordered new one without subscriptions and got the item within 4 days(Thanks to Amazon delivery). Even now everything worked fine. I was worried on reading few reviews that the remote doesn't pair, but in my case it paired at very 1st attempt. Now there is diwali offer on few subscriptions where we get annual packs for low prices. Purchased zee5 for 500.So better not to waste on firetv plus and waste your time calling customer care(may work fine but it is just 2 lucky out of 10, where all 3 works good). Except purchase normal one and subscribe yourself which works all tasks in few minutes. Anyway the fire os is best and it is rocking . Dolby sound is plus point in this. Don't think twice just go for it without further thinking.

Best if there is an Atmos system



  This can to be used directly with TV normally. No issues work smoothly and video clarity. Audio is where it shines. If you have a Dolby or Atmos audio system this one nails with audio. In display and audio settings we have auto volume level and dialogue enhance. Normal pcm also sounding great. Dolby sounds awesome. If your audio system is HDMI arc and connected to tv, then this one firetv remote will control tv home theater and fire stick. For tv on off and volume control it uses infrared. Its a very intelligent way of implementation.

  1. It doesn't have option to change video quality. Once on a while all of sudden the video quality drops drastically so if it had video setting option, it would be great.2.

Great stick with very good Smart TV features



  I think This is the best TV stick to convert regular TV into a smart TV. Connect to a TV with WiFi password handy, it will do a rest of the things. Using nearly for a month now but no problems at all. Screen mirroring function is available which I think was not available in earlier versions.But only thing noticed that, as my TV is fitted on wall, it is bit difficult to put the stick in the HDMI port even with extension cable provided with the package. Will need bit compact extension cable plug to put in TV socket. Everything all good about TV stick.

One word to describe. ULTIMATE.. in bold and capital.



  I never imagined a product this nice and perfect. I mean, there is hardly any thing which is wrong or faulty.1. Works with any brand of LED TV as long as it has an HDMI port. Now even not so smart TV can be a smart Tv. If you have an old non smart TV, for a small expense, you can enjoy smart tv experience.2. Has bluetooth as well with which you can connect your headphones so that you can enjoy late night shows without disturbing sleep of person sleeping next to you.3. The Prime day sale gave this at a fabulous price.4. Though it works better on a high speed internet connection it still works satisfactorily on a mobile hotspot. With a 2 gb data, you can easily enjoy a full movie. It will be a bit lesser if you skip and fast forward the songs.5. It even plays Youtube. Keeping kids entertained was never so easy.6. One wish.. the case which is sold separately for 400 Rs should be a part of entire kit.Full Value for money .

  October 9th (Recent Edit):‚Äê-----‚Äê-----------------------I have received the replacements and both of them are working. The replacement procedure was a bit different than other items. The sticks were picked before the replacements came. I confirmed with the customer service representatives and they assured it was the case with Fire TV Sticks. Since the replacement procedure was hassle free, I am updating my ratings to 3 stars (Met expectations).October 5th:---------------Recently I order the 3rd Gen Sticks (Bundle of 2) for just 3.6K on October 4th and got them delivered on 5th, Perks of Prime member :D. All good so far!Unfortunately, all good things end here.I unboxed the first box, plugged into the HDMI port and followed the instructions to pair the remote. That's it! No progress whatsoever from the welcome screen. Tried everything suggested in the manual and support team, but in vain.  I was worried about unboxing the 2nd stick, but after unboxing it was like a ""deja vu"" moment. Both sticks are not pairing with remotes.After asking around with my friends and cousins, I found one of my cousin who got the stick on October 4th, also has the same issue.I explained this to the customer service representative, and he has arranged for the replacement. Will update this review after I get the replacement.

1st Gen stick performs better than 3rd Gen



  My 1st Gen stick catches wifi far well than this one. Also the 1st gen stick connects to bluetooth devices much far from it while this one needs a device thats not more than 4 feet away from the tv. Alexa doesnt work time and again and it says 'cant connect to amazon server try again later or call customer care'. Thus even voice recognition doesnt work well. Lastly it couldnt control my BPL led tv despite having bpl in its list. 1st Gen fire stick (now being sold as firestick light) is way better than this one. Dunno how is this an upgrade. If you wifi range is even slightly weak, it wont connect. But 1st Gen fire stick connects even super weak wifi from adjacent rooms without issue. Lastly, wifi will show 'no internet' (despite my internet connection working totally fine) once every 24 hrs and then we gotto turn off and turn on wifi on firestick again to make it work. Wont buy amazon sticks again.

Bcoz after installing JioTV, you've to control it through FireTV Remote and it's not an easy work as JioTV app made for your laptop & smartphone but you've no cursers or painting device for TV.Other than that, everything is perfect.

Worth the buy.  üòç 4k vs lite vs 3rd gen.



  I got 4k for almost two years and was very happy with it. That's used for my TV and it's butter smooth.  Later I wanted to buy one for projector. As it didn't support power/volume button on firestick, ordered the lite on launch day. Was happy with that too but that was not fast as 4k.I was eyeing on the new remote with 3rd gen stick and what a better time to purchase than this.Now coming to this device.Quick activation. If you are buying for yourself, please check the ""link to my account"" . No need of manual setup..Streaming quality is superb and it's in full hd resolution as you all knowAlexa integration - mic symbol replaced with alexa icon. It opens apps/channels without a problem. Have been using that for longRemote. Wish there was hotstar/sony instead of Amazon music. Prime video/Netflix buttons are very useful.Only surprise ::  I have an old 22"" Del monitor which got HDMI input. Unfortunately it didn't give output on that. I was in the impression that it works on any device with HDMI inputs. As Amazon gives you a no question asked return in 10 days, you need not worry.I used mi stick and mibox before. There is a huge difference between them and firestick devices.Prices are never been better. Remote costs üòÄHope someone find it useful.

Excellent firestick.






                    The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†I like the performances without any doubt. I tried the 3rd generation firestick with our one plus 65"" android TV. I am very much impressed. I have also used on my LG 32inch TV also. I have observed the same quality of performance. Every thing is working fine and I updated the software also very easily. I am not having WiFi and I am using Hotspot from my mobile. Performance is undoubtedly excellent. I recommend to interested customers to go for this where Hd port is available for their TV's.

Amazing amazing amazing product I bought it for apple tv



  I have smart tv at home and for second unit i am using Comcast but it is not very dependable and i was waiting for some solution to get ride of it .  Fire tv is more like mini android phone or having cheaper version of apple tv .Ui is awesome but stick is not that fast and kind a laggy ( typical android kind a thing ) . But can‚Äôt complain.One more reason to like it more is bluetooth support for headphones or earphones ( you can‚Äôt pair two headphones or earphones simultaneously)  With dolby digital plus watching HQ content is perk .Try to avoid 4k edition if you have smart tv or even if not now a day Smart TV available for 12-15k so not logical to spend 4-5k for stick only . Among all Indian edition is good deal ( i got it for 2,000‚Çπ )Go for it really liked it alot .

Very good streamer



  I have and am using mi stick.  This was for the second tv.  The Amazon prime part is very fast.  YouTube like normal speed.  Most other apps are there.  My major 2 cons are.  a). There is no instructions on how it starts.  It was prompting me to push a 3 dot button on my remote which was not there.  I randomly clicked some buttons and it started.  b). In the Amazon app in Android tv there is a move video button which shows the scenes much like YouTube.  Could not do that in fire stick.  But other than that, the speed is really good.  Will be checking more and updating.  Alexa assistant is a bit of a hit and miss and in my case more miss.  This inspite of me having an Alexa at home and that is working well.  So this was surprising.  May get well with time.

Best Fire Stick so far amongst all.



  The Best part of this fire stick is its wifi receptive mode and I do have 2 Sony Tvs and one is W820 Android latest one and one is old Sony tv of 2017, i found even the latest sony tv get defeated against this fire stick as this fire stick was playing such smoothly irrespective of Sony Android tv where default All OTT are there but was buffering a lot on my good wifi speed whereas on same tv this firestick was running smoothly.So yes receptive mode, picture quality, sound, all are as of now after using more than 3 months, its flawless.Dont buy 4k fire stick or fire stick lite. Buy this as this is the Best Stick you will get as of now.

  Product is really good. I am using it in my 6-7 years old TV, which has HDMI support to use this amazon fire tv stick. Believe me, i am in love with the remote, its compact, works smoothly.Few people who complaints, thats why i would like to mention some points which i follow and then i am facing no issues.1. Your wifi router should be nearby to get the best speed and network.2. If you have 5GHz network then its really good.3. Alexa works fine but its very limited to certain apps.Also please when it will start for the first time, please have some patience, it will take some time to set up then from next time, its works amazing.

Stay away if you want to buy for Dolby Atmos as this device does not support



  Latest Update as of 27/12/21Have to reduce 2 stars I bought 2 Echo Studio speakers and paired with Fire TV Stick to get the DOlby Atmos effect, although the Eco Studio speakers support this Fire TV Stick does not support Dolby ATmos as claimed by Amazon. I have read each and every setting and had a conversation with many engineers form Amazon and got this confirmed. Please do not buy this if you want to pair it with any Dolby Atmos speakers. You will be disappointed like me.I have been using the Gen 1 Fire TV Stick with my non smart Panasonic TV since the launch of Fire TV Stick Gen 1. I recently purchased an Android TV from Panasonic and The OS was slow in responding and based on my experience with Fire TV Stick I thought of purchasing another Fire TV Stick to pair with this TV also because I am more familiar with Amazon Ecosystem then the Android / Google. It was a no brainer to go in for the Fire TV Stick with Dolby Atmos support because I plan to purchase Atmos Soundbar soon.The set up was easy like any other Amazon device however I was somehow not able to use the volume up down button with my TV. The workaround was to pair the bluetooth remote directly with my TV using bluetooth and then most of the functions worked and the TV could be switched off using the Fire TV remote but it could not be switched on again not sure why.The UI is simple and the response is faster then my Gen 1 stick also the boot time is much faster and hence I mentioned good device but not without flaws. Lot of R&D is still needed to be put in. Go for it if and only if you are keen on Fire TV Stick with Dolby Atmos Support else you would be better off buying the normal Fire TV Stick.I shall update the review once I pair the Atmos speaker with the Fire TV Stick.

Cheapest way to get dolby atmos content



  I have an older 4k tv which doesn't support dolby atmos,  but a new atmos compatible soundbar. Was struggling to getting atmos source till i came across this newer model of firestick that supports atmos content on netflix too. Even the 4k stick doesnt. I do miss the 4k stream but full hd hdr with dolby atmos is good enough compromise till i get a newer atmos compatible tv. Good vfm option.

  When I had placed the order for the fire stick during the prime day sale, they had displayed that enjoy zee5, sonyliv & voot  for 1 year bundled with the firestick but now when I tried I am getting error saying this offer is not for this device. First when I called Amazon customer care, they told me a procedure to login.When it still didn't happen, now customer care says that this offer not applicable for ur device. Then y were they displaying that subscription for those 3 are free along with the firestick?? Amazon has to sort out this issue at the earliest. Really disappointed!!

  After some research only , I have placed an order for amazon fire stick, audio output is awesome which is equallent of real theater sound exprience if you use even mid level sound system also. I am using Normal Philips 5.1 system.. Bcz of this stick quality getting good output..Picture clarity also super and, also I like the firestick user interface and easy navigation along with remote Alexa voice etc.. .. Reason why I order this product is it has volume control + full HD support, my jiofi bandwidth support to stream Full HD.. as iam having good signal for jio, I am 100 percentage happy with this device, so I recommend.If you wanted get volume control and power button control select your TV brand or equallent option from setting tab, I am using this device 1st time and 1st day.. For 24 inch Sony TVIt is easy to manage..

Issue fixed. Combo pack Battery is not as per description



  Updated Review.Looks like it's a mistake happened from the developers who added a wrong product.Customer care team contacted me and asked me to order 8 AAA batteries and once it's delivered they have refunded the amount. So basically my issue has been fixed. Thank you so much Amazon.I got this product for 1999 rs for one 3rd gen fire stick. Bought this product since my second generation firestick stopped working after 3 years and repairing cost is1500 Rs.Orginal Review on 24th October 2021As per the combo pack description, two firestick and one set of 4 AAA batteries are included, but they are sending AAAA batteries instead of AAA batteries which we can't use anywhere in the firestick remote. Resolve my issue and I'll edit my review.

Great product in a great price.



  I was already using the Fire Stick Lite on my LED tv so the functions and interface were not new to me, I ordered this one to use it with my projector as I was very sure that it will work. I'm currently using egate 9 projector with Fire Stick 3rd generation and what a experience!! You can see the difference when you connect the projector with laptop and then with Fire Stick. The first difference you will notice is the picture quality and the second and most important due to which I ordered my second Fire Stick is the discrepancy in synchronization of audio and video while connected to laptop. Problem solved and now I can enjoy uninterrupted movies and webseries on 130 inch huge screen.

Chrome is good, fire stick is better



  I own a GoogleChromecast, and honestly, The Amazon fire stick was the best decision I've made. I've used chrome for 5 yrs now (1st Generation), the Amazon firestick I purchased it yesterday, so the review below is just a day one experience.@Chromecast vs Firestick#difference.- Phone V/S remote- limited apps V/S unlimited apps- online only V/S can download content and take it along anywhere- have to set up from scratch every time you change the wifi V/S need to only change wifi details#Common:- can create up to 6 profiles- wifi connection required (obviously) I have heard that you can download on the firestick and take it with you if you're traveling (not sure of this works)

One remote for all.



  A couple of years back my ordinary LED samsung television sound stopped working. So instead of trying to find someone to repair it, I decided to purchase a soundbar. However since then everytime we needed to watch tv, its been 3 remotes one for my existing firetv stick (5 years old before it conked out), the other for TV and finally one for the fire tv stick.With this newer generation firetv stick, the remote has integrated the power of the tv, the soundbar with volumen up/down and the stick intelligently!!  I didnt have to put any effort.Also so far the display is much better than the old generation. Must be something to do with using newer wifi technology in it.

Perfect tool to convert TV into Smart TV



  Got this at a cheap price during the Amazon sale during October 2021.Very easy to set up with the self explanatory guide. Takes about 15 minutes to update your fire stick and finish set up.The updated 2021 version comes with the new remote with which you can control everything, so much so after buying and setting this up you won't require your original TV remote again.The Alexa app does a decent job of recognising your voice and following the command.Stream quality is excellent.The only drawback or inefficiency is in the live TV button given in the remote and the option itself.It's meant to pull all the live TV channels from your subscribed apps and display them together so that you don't have to open the apps separately.But in spite of 'syncing' multiple times, fire TV couldn't sync and show the channels from the apps

Poor quality product. Overheating issues started on the first day of use.



  This is my second Fire Stick and I am regretting the purchase. Had a poor experience with the first one as well.I bought the 1st gen Stick a few years ago - which lasted a couple of years and then it developed a personality. It would connect to wifi when it wanted and disconnected whenever it felt like it. Some days it would refuse to recognize the router (I have fiber FTH). And one fine day it stopped working completely.I bought the latest (2021) version of the First Stick to give it another try. On the first day, within 15 minutes of use, I started getting warnings from it - messages on the TV screen saying it was getting overheated (it is used in a room with an AC always on - with an ambient temperature at 25C or lower). I suspect this too will die in a few weeks of use.Sometimes you get what you pay for. Seems to be made of ultra cheap components. So no surprise that its performance is garbage. Avoid.IMHO, Roku is a far better value for money (my Roku from a decade ago is still working fine). You can play all the apps on it, just like the Fire Stick. But it is rock solid and you will be happy with it.

Amazon has created a gem of a product



  It works perfectly with yamaha home theatre. Watching movies is so much fun now. We had a Chromecast before this. And I must tell that this device is way ahead of Chromecast. No more fiddling with the phone to watch. Just one remote controls even my HTR.Plus the voice functionality is pretty intuitive. Even my 5 yr old uses it to watch rhymes. Sigh!!!There are still some niggles though. Searching for content within an app is tough. Eg. Search for a song in Spotify and it would start playing in Amazon Music. Is that by design? Well, everything else works fine.Also, you need to keep the remote coddled. It costs 2000 bucks to replace and that remote is the lifeline of this device.

Streaming quality is good ... I have reported the problem to call centre and they have sent me a new device in a day which is good ... So the service if fast and good ...

Good addition to convert your semi-smart TV to smart TV



  Helps to make your semi -smart TV to a smart Tv by adding a lot of apps and Alexa. I had been using the Fire TV 2020 model as part of Tata Sky Binge - first month free and then Rs.249 a month added to your Tata Sky DTH recharge. And to watch Netflix, Amazon, Zee5, Hotstar, etc. you pay separately ranging from Rs.499 a year to the same a month. Last month, I ditched Tata Sky Binge and bought the new Fire TV stick 2021 at Rs.3999 and the difference is that I own this. Functionally, there‚Äôs not any difference between the new and the old barring dedicated buttons fir Netflix and YouTube on the remote. Anyway, Fire TV stick is useless without subscription to the Apps mentioned earlier. The new TVs May not require this though. I bought a new LG Oled TV which comes with an additional Magic Remote which does all the stuff done by Fire TV stick + it acts like a computer mouse and better in selecting the alphabets when you need to type in your log in id for any app ( can log in using the same app on phone too without this trouble). I am using the Fire TV stick on the Sony Bravia bought in 2015 which is somewhat smart and Fire TV stick brings it at par with the new LG TV, well almostüòÄ

This is my review after 15 days of use.Installation and initial setup was very simple and connected to my BSNL fibre broadband wifi in a jiffy. It also works well with mobile hotspot. But to enjoy streaming to the fullest better to have fibre broadband.The new UI is absolutely fantastic with smooth and fluid interface. Browsing experience is fantastic too.All major apps are available in app store. Streaming is top class without any lag or buffer with outstanding picture quality. Switching between apps is also lag-free.Alexa remote is just superb with perfect voice recognition on my first ever attempt.Simply go for it.

Bluetooth audio, voice recognition, streaming great



  Must buy if you find it under 2500 again.I got free prime subscription for 3 months as well.Few points:1. Always purchase this version. Dont buy lite version. I returned lite version. Reason is bluetooth audio. Lite version has very low bluetooth audio and you can not even hear dialogues.  This version of sticks has volume controls for bluetooth devices with latest firmware update so you can use fire stick remote to control your bluetooth headphone/soundbar audio. Trust me this helps a lot. Please update firestick bios to use this feature.2. Voice recognition on this version is very great and works on all apps.3. If you are connecting with aux cable or want to is TV Audio, please use PCM onlyoption fron audio settings on stick.4. If your bluetooth headphone/ soundbar has Bluetooth 5.0 then there is no lag in audio while watching movies. You can blindly purchase this stick as this has bluetooth version 5.0.  Other sticks like Mi and realme has bluetooth 4.0 which results in audio lag.I am using it with projector with soundbar and I am getting true theatre like feeling no doubt.

  Best if you are not having a smart tv and want to convert it to one.Pros :-The streaming quality is good.Good options for apps.Inbuild Amazon Prime, Music and Netflix ButtonsThe remote syncs with the TV remote, so no need to use 2 remotes.Cons :-Sometimes the performance is slow.Alexa is Useless ( You need to have a proper English ascent )Conclusion :-Would recommend to others. As it is in budget and very easy to navigate.

Those who ask for Atmos, here's the proof..



  I was really looking for Atmos media player and got fooled earlier with 4k firestick which doesn't have atmos audio support.After a long research I found 3rd Gen stick supports Dolby Atmos,  I'm not worried about 4k where my receiver is capable of upscaling it.I'm giving 4Star as I still don't find Atmos in Amazon prime, Netflix does. And thanks to Amazon for delivering within 24hrs.Added photo to get the proof of Atmos, which I didn't see anyone posted earlier while I was looking for it. Thank you üëç

Device doesn't work



  The device looks new and of good quality but it is simply not setting up. As soon as it starts, it gets stuck on ""Searching for remote"" screen. The remote is not pairing with the firestick at all. I have tried every solution; changing batteries even though the product is brand new, factory resetting the remote, fire tv app, and all other ways available online. Nothing seems to work. Since remote is not pairing up with the device, it is also not proceeding further. I have no menu, no options left. I have spent a whole day trying to set it up. I am not going to waste anymore time because this is a device which is supposed to have a simple setup with most of the functions done automatically. There is no replacement option available for it. I am just going to return this firestick and try other products available in the market.

Nice buy



  Fire Sticks have existed now for more than a couple of years and are quite popular. So my decision to buy one is quite late, since we had become quite accustomed to streaming everything on our laptops and haven‚Äôt bought a TV which we firmly believe is an absolute idiot box. Having said this, I‚Äôm using the Fire Stick on a computer monitor and it is an absolutely fine buy, I must admit. If I ever buy a TV it‚Äôll only be for the Fire Stick and nothing else. Will not be commenting on the functionality because many before me would have said much more. All I would want to say is that it is a really good buy for the family.

If few buttons stop working suddenly‚Äî> replace the batteries



  For those having problems with some buttons not working READ THIS :When i recieved my firestick it was superb. Everything was working great. But after few days of usage or let‚Äôs say1-2 weeks , the Volume button , Power button & Mute button stopped working. I was soo disappointed.The streaming and everything else worked fine. Soo i just continued using it cz the exchange process is very tedious.After few months it was time to change the batteries (had been using the batteries provided with the kit till now).And Viola ! Once i put in the new batteries, the remote was working absolutely fine once again. Even the buttons that Had stopped working were absolutely fine.Therefore, long story short - just replace the batteries if few  buttons on your remote stop working.

Poor wifi connectivity



  I am writing this review after using the product for more than 10 days. There is persistent wifi connectivity issue with this model. It keeps disconnecting and the speed is also not good. I kept my phone at the same spot where fire stick is attached and the Internet speed is 30 mbps on my phone whereas fire tv stick shows Internet as speed 8 mbps. I am using Mi tv stick on another TV and wifi connectivity is very good in spite of the fact that router is placed very very far.Amazon should fix this.

Total internal storage around 8GB, if u have any OTT logins you can install though Amazon store.

Not Much Difference in 2ndgen & 3rd Gen



  not worth to upgrade, 3rd gen stick is better perform application switching but not seen much difference specially Sony liv & Zee5 compare to 2ndgen stick  , Amazon team should thing about to add more RAM to handle applications instead of adding application specific dedicate buttons on remote. Still I am a FAN of Amazon Fire TV is not comparable with any other steaming device it best streaming device available in market I am using it since 2017.

Excellent Product



  Excellent product even if you are not subscribing for any channels like Amazon Prime or Net Flix etc. I have been using it only for watching programs in You Tube and Alexa listens and Comprehends easily. If she fails, even if you give spelling, she will search and display the programs. Even though my TV screen quality is not upto the mark, somehow, the Stick is able to give me best picture quality in streaming. This is amazing. I saw my relative family using this for showing Tenali Ramakrishna stories in You Tube and I recommended this Stick to my team for watching various You Tube Trainings on technical subjects, BPMN training and BPM training etc., The effect will be amazing.Note: If the stick fails, you will end-up paying another INR 2000 for its replacement. Hence, please download their app (while the stick is working) on another dummy smart phone and if the stick crashes, you will have a back-up.

Home theater and bluetooth audio does not work



  The device is good in terms of streaming quality but I have an issue with audio. It has a feature called home theater where you can connect the stick and your Echo, but whenever I do that, the device always freezes. Tech support already replaced id twice but the same issue on all the replacements as well. They say that the device is disconnecting from network, of course it disconnects cause when it freezes it is  no longer connected to wifi. Sometimes they tell its my Echo and some times they tell its the fire stick. I factory reset my router, echo and the fire stick multiple times and I just gave up on this. Tech support says they will call back with an update but they never do, pathetic service by Amazon.Then I thought I would connect the fire stick via Bluetooth to the echo, guess what that also does not work. The audio is barely audible even at maximum level, when contacting the tech support for this issue, they gave me the same troubleshooting steps as before and then when nothing worked, THEY JUST SAID THAT THEY WILL TAKE FEEDBACK. NO RESOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM!!!!!!!!! Even the supervisors are not able to help me out, so now I have got a fire stick which does not work with external audio sources and I am stuck to use it via the worse speakers of my TV.I am MORE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TECH SUPPORT I RECEIVED THAN THE DEVICE.

Life ain't complete without a Firestick !



  If you do not own this and own a TV you are missing something . Stop reading reviews and just order this. Life will be more peaceful. And do get that Netflix subscription. The lowest subscription works best.  Of course this means you will do less housework, spend less time in the gym, talk less to useless friends. But what a great device for you and your wife/husband to quietly spend the evening watching the movie ""Chances Are ....""

Works great but be mindful of which TVs it works with



  Great device, very performant. Doesn't lag on my Jio Wifi at 30 Mbps speed. Great picture quality. Only problem is that it didn't work fully with my Noble Skiodo TV - the volume and power buttons didn't integrate with the TV's software. Amazon should let customers know beforehand which TVs it works with. I saw Noble Skiodo in the list of TVs while setting up this remote but somehow it was not able to download the TV control software from their website. Noble Skiodo TV model that I had is no longer available on Amazon so that may be responsible for lack of software. Anyways, I returned it to buy a Fire TV stick Lite edition which doesn't have power and volume controls and will save me 400 Rs. I purchased this device for Rs 2199 in October 2021.

Very useful if you don't have a smart TV but have a TV with a HDMI port and internet connection.



  The product is very useful and worth the money. I bought it at 2200 at sale, but if you don't have a smart TV and have a TV with HDMI port and have internet connection, and also not thinking of upgrading the TV for like quite a time, then this product is very useful. But remember only the youtube content is totally free, everything else is paid, you need to have some OTT membership, which has really became normal these days. Also remember to buy an extender if your TV is wall mounted and the device may get trapped inside as the internet won't catch and it won't work. The extender included is really just a small cable, size of charging cable you get with a power bank.

Just telling u need to pair your tv with the firestick remote.. if it doesn't work.. you need to change the IR profile that's available for ur tv... Mine didn't work for the default one..I had to change the IR profile.. in have only TV option.. Hope this helps and clears ur doubt.. only thing that concerned me was space given.. only 4-5 GB space was provided.. which they should improve in the upcoming version..All in all, I liked it.. it's good way to convert ur tv into something more and more useful.. Watching 855 channels for free,latest webseries and movies for free,that too on the big screen... is something awesome.. So go for it.. U will love it..

It's Best out of All in that price range. But only one concern about 3rd Gen Fire Stick



  The product is a real gem. I have bought this 2nd time. First was 2nd generation one. I should have given 5 star for the product compare to price. I got it for Rs. 2099.00 on prime day sale. This was an irresistible deal. But I have given 2 star for the product to get attention the bug I am going to talk about. On my 2nd Gen Fire Stick when I connect to my Bluetooth Jbl Sound Bar it can play Dolby Digital Plus. I get the option to choose to play Dolby Digital Plus or only stereo. But on my 3rd Gen fire stick when I connect my Jbl sound bar via bluetooth it only shows stereo. I can't play Dolby Digial Plus via bluetooth. I have tried every possible way to play. But it can't. I hope it will be fixed very soon.

It thought to buy chromecast because of the reviews of fire stick but I thought to try it out and it's working.......the problem is The price is a bit high it should be around 3500 or less because fire stick lite base the same specs as 3rd generation has..........the main difference is it supports Dolby audio and has a volume feature in remote that's all

  During first time installation my Wifi did not connect. I am not sure whether it is because of HDMI adapter not used since in manual mentioned to use HDMI adapter for better network connectivity. Later I connected with HDMI adapter but still Wifi did not connect. Later I tried with my Mobile hotspot then it connected and updated the software. After that I tried to connect with my Wifi then it got connected. So I won't say this as a complaint but sharing my experience. So when you are trying to install it for first time better have a alternate network connection available.Pros:1. Volume and power button helps really well2. Very fast while using apps3. Even you can play gamesCons:1. I feel bit costly (only for added button features)

Honest Review of Firestick



  I was initially skeptical to buy this product because I wondered how my 10 years old LCD TV can connect to Internet on my home network and run the apps.  when I got the product all I had to do is insert the cell connect the USB port for the charging and hooked up the fire stick to my TV and turned it on, within no second it detected my Wi-Fi network and my old TV was able to connect to Internet, I downloaded Netflix prime and YouTube and voot, it all worked fantastic, the speed was much faster than it would play on my laptop, then I lost my remote, but guess what I could download the remote on my Android phone and use my cell phone as remote.  the voice commands are clearly catched and it plays exactly what you asked for.  now kids don't watch cell phone and watch TV which is at least good.  if you have a TV with HDMI port then this product is a must buy

Better than stock Android platform TV.



  I'm very happy, and totally satisfied with firetv.It is far better than any stock Android TV, because it is lag free and way easier to nevigate through different functions.Moreover Alexa remote is fabulous it's never disappoint me and always understand Indian English, hindi easily.So it can be say that overall experience is awesome and i started tv for improvement in knowledge....rather than wasting time earlier.

Still lags



  1: I had a previous generation stick and I upgraded to this one for the new UI and supposedly faster response time. I was sadly mistaken. The UI lags if not for the worst from previous generation and I don't see any difference in opening of apps as well2: The battery cover is flimsy and keep coming off.3: In general I didn't like the new UI over the old one. It can be subjective.

Awesome little device



  Amazing device, whether you have a smart tv or not (HDMI input & good Internet connection required). I have an LG smart tv which doesn't support some apps, so went for Airtel Xstream box which gets stuck once in a day or two days. It was quite irritating. Bought this on Amazon prime day and got it for just 2k .. seamless connectivity and great streaming with loads of features and as a plus you get some OTT's free. Overall great product to have. Bought another one during Independence day sale but had to pay 2.7k for 2nd tv. Of course you need to have a good internet connection with 100 Mbps speed or as suggested to best performance. One thing I don't like is the voice recognition, sometimes it doesn't show what you are looking for.

  I had a very old fire stick maybe the 1st generation, now upgraded to this 3rd gen, and the speed as promised is 50% more (in fact more for me as I am migrating from a very old stick).Option / menus and response time are minimal. More importantly I can control my TV on/off and volume from fire stick. Full value for money. Got it at a good price in the amazon sale.

Good to buy for Ordinary TV but with lite model



  Product is good and worth to buy for Ordinary or non-Smart TV. But the remote lags the feature of power off and volume adjust if the TV doesn't support it. So basic remote or lite model should be better for basic led tv as you should continue using TV remote for volume and power off. Otherwise streaming quality is good as long as you have better internet connection with minimum around 7mbps speed. Price is bit high normally but I bought during the offer so I am happy with it.

Best to get during sale days as it‚Äôs quite expensive otherwise.I have the 2nd gen as well but it is slower and has issues in remote however this one is surely an improvement obviously.The delivery was on time and well packaged, still a better choice than the default sluggish interface of android in the so called newer smart tvs.Amazon seems to have an issue with Disney Hotstar as it‚Äôs recommendations are not shown on home page and that is a bad thing since I have a premium membership of that streaming service.Overall a very good product that serves its purpose.

Then he placed a replacement. Received the replacement order and that stick is not getting detected in any TV.  Asked to another replacement the customer service agent said can't replace and now can only return n reorder.The cost of new is quite higher that the one I bought forAmazon seems not doing proper quality check on their products now a days....

Not rightly priced, otherwise good



  I bought this because the latest Chromecast by Google is not available in India. The price to performance is not justified, this product should not cost more than 2.5k. The current price of 4k is completely unreasonable. Don't buy it unless there is an ongoing sale on it. And yes never get distracted by the discount percentages on Amazon for anything. Those percentages are manipulated by changing the MRP here and there. Now talking about the performance of the product, the U.I is better than previous generation of fire stick, the booting time is longer than the previous generation but once it's on it's indeed faster (I know this because I have the previous version as well which I have been using since 2 yrs). To sum up its the best amoung the limited choices that we have, but yes only if you get it under 3K.

Make in India and quality takes a hit :(



  I upgraded to this latest gen from the first gen Fire TV stick.My main reason for upgrading was the lack of TV controls and the interface bogged down a bit which made it a little irritating to use.Now coming to the product, I‚Äôm utterly disappointed with the build quality of the remote.  It feels like it would shatter after a few drops. The fit and finish is subpar and the rubber used on the buttons attracts a lot of dust. Once you hold this product in your hand, you‚Äôll immediately tell that it‚Äôs a very cheap product. The first gen felt a lot more premium.When it comes to the software aspect, it feels smooth and there are no lags. The new interface looks nice and the Alexa integration is nicely done.However, I do not like the frequent ads that are displayed in between episodes on Prime Video.Is it worth the MRP? Absolutely not.Is it worth buying during a sale after heavy discount? Yes, maybe.

An effective alternative for Smart TV



  Atfirst I should thank Amazon for giving a huge discount on this product during Great Indian Festival. Using it near about 3 weeks. Initially there was no lag in software and UI but after 2 or 3 updates UI has become slower. Software is hanging sometimes. Stream quality is very good. Wifi connectivity is awesome. But Bluetooth output through bluetooth enabled sound system  is awful . In those sound systems I am using Tantra bluetooth receiver ( version 5 ) . But speakers are not at all audible. But using the same sound systems with same bluetooth receiver with laptop and mobile is giving appreciable output. Device has also heating issue while using it with HDMI2AV converter. Voice response through Alexa is splendid. Mobile app for remote control also works most of the time without any issue. Particularly typing facility in the app is awesome. Overall a good and effective subsitiute for Smart TV.But still I would like to give some suggetions to the developers for the improvement of  couple of features in this device . Internal memory should be more. Heating issue should be corrected. Bluetooth performance should be improved.

I received 2 Fire TV sticks and both doesn't work!!!



  Guys at Amazon!! - This is seriously sad about the kind of product, that I have received. The first Fire TV Stick was not getting paired with the remote and the replacement was received today and it was the same issue. The Stick was responding to few commands to the remote through the app on the phone but going back to the screen which says ""Pair your remote"". The physical remote was not getting paired. Your tech guys took the remote access of my TV screen and tried their bit but still no luck. This is sad that you guys don't have any QC done even for a replacement product. The whole business of me wanting to change from Chromecast to Fire TV has become a futile one. The purpose of getting an Echo along with this is also become redundant. So I don't know what do do the Echo too. Now there is no more replacement according to you guys and it will be a refund. And again being a more than a regular user and purchaser of products through Amazon this is very depressing. Hope you guys can do something about it to me because the point of getting a product is have it put to use. Refund's doesn't work.

I loved it as I always wanted to experience Fire Stick OS



  *MUST READ*The product and the packaging was extremely good. I first thought that it might have been damaged because the packages brought by the delivery man were on top of each other. The fire stick OS is absolutely phenomenal. The best thing is that we don't have to pay any NCF fees or that just to stream on free applications. It is all good but sometimes it lags maybe due to my internet connection. In the third day of this I faced problems with my remote,I thought that it might be a problem of my TV but it wasn't, all other remote buttons were working just fine. I started panicking as it was my first time having a streaming device. The next day, I changed the batteries of the remote and it started working flawlessly. I am satisfied as I now cannot return my product as it will cost me almost double the cost I paid for it. Hopefully it works beautifully and without any lag in the future.

Best Smart Device



  I am writing the review after 1 full week of use. Below is the detail review :-Device Price/cost ::-I purchased Amazin fire tv stick plus which cost me around 3099/- rs with Sony liv + Zee5 + Voot annual subscription.U can lso purchase non subscription product but the difference is just 300 Rs and in which u get 1700/- rs of benifits.Please note without apps subscription the device is just playing You tube only. So. I recommended atleast get Prime and hotstar subscriptionStreaming quality ::-great streaming quality, convert your normal TV device in smart device, Internet connection required nand believe me just 5-10 mbps plan is enough to stream on full HD.Subscription activation ::-Believe me Sony Liv and voot can be subscribed without any problem. U jtt need to install the app and its showing u that u get the 1year membership and showing u a url, run it on yiur mobile device and enter the code which showing on Fire tv stick screen your subscription is started, u can also use it on your other mobile and PC Device as well.ZEE 5 Subscription ::-This is the most searched topic for this product, i also require Amazin customer care help to start this but by watching few You tube video i get how to start ZEE5.Its just simple you just need to clear cache and clear data of the app then uninstall the app and install it.And it shows 2 option u just chose 2nd one which was login with Amazon account and enter the OTP come on your Amazon account email and jayt after entering OTP,  It  will shows you the annual subscription.Please note if still it not helped again reinstall it 2nd time it will surely started.

All Live Channels will not sync into the Live channels list..

  Let‚Äôs talk about fire stick generation 3rd. The device is well built and have nice build quality. Installation setup is very easy and quick. I have android tv also if I compare both fire stick is quite fast. The most positive point is it‚Äôs speed and response time. Android tv get slow with time. I think voice command should be improved a bit according to Indian accent and battery cover should be bit more tighter which will make it long lasting to stay.

Big issue. Very difficult to watch live channels



  To watch live channels we hav to always open related app. For example if you want to watch sab tv you hav to open sony live app. Live channels list is not showing in interface. We can not even see program timings. In home page interface  not a single live channel is showing. This problem is having only in fire stick 2021. So  it is nightmare to reach at live channels. Not showing ON NOW  option on home page. Not showing channel guide. If you command alexa to open aaj tak or any other live channel it will not show the specific live channel. This is software issue. Could be resolved in future. Till now not enjoying all the benefits of fire stick 2021. Very disappointed. Thinking to replace it with old fire stick having all the features.

Almost perfect



  So much faster than my previous Gen 1 Fire Stick. The new UI is meh (banner full of ads is not what I want to see when I start it up), but the performance has been faultless so far. Boots up quickly too. And no issues with Bluetooth peripherals like the previous one. Only deducting one star because of the abysmal build quality of the remote. The joystick and the battery cover creak every time I hold it. Feels extremely fragile. Added buttons on the remote are a timesaver. But please do something about it‚Äôs build in the next iteration.

  Good purchase I would say. The initial setup took sometime (probably due to my slow net connection). Amazon prime comes pre-installed. You might need to manually download other streaming platforms. The Remote is cool and handy. Works well with all navigation. The volume button only works for the TV. It doesn't have a volume function built in inside the Stick I think. Picture quality is good.  Regarding Audio, I connect the Fire Stick directly to my Harman AVR HDMI port which has only upto Dolby TruHd capability not Atmos. The display will always shows Dolby Digital Plus. And on new Amazon titles I get a clearer 3.2.1 surround sound @48Khz and 2.0.0 on old titles where the display still shows Dolby Digital Plus!Overall, it's a good buy. If you have a Dolby Atmos capable receiver and setup, then just go blindly and enjoy!

Superb streaming device



  Mine is smart tv already but no support to hotstar and zee5 OTTs. That's the main reason I bought this device. Using this for the past two weeks and most of the times I don't see any lag. Sometimes I feel delayed response time Of fire stick.What I like:1. I bought it for 2099 during Amazon sale. For this price, this device is worth for each rupee we spent (I was thinking to buy mi box 4k considering the price earlier)2. Navigation and set up is smooth3. Streaming quality is really awesome4. Controls to operate TV. I feel this is very important as my original tv remote id already broken5. Alexa voice search: I like this a lot6. Preset button: though I'm not using much, this is very useful featureWhat can be added:1. App Store not offering all the apps that are available in play store of other android streaming device. If all the apps available, some education related apps like seesaw for ex. can be used on tv. This device deserves 5 star but due to this point and next, only 4 star at the moment2. If possible, offering play store also would be great something similar to galaxy store and play store on Samsung smart phones3. Alexa voice search is useful to open apps and play movie or songs on same OTT. If we want to switch to other app and sub task inside, Alexa could not get it. For ex, if I want to open and play a song in youtube from other apps, it just opens youtube but not completing the rest of the commands. Google assistant is better in this aspect4. Experiance of screen mirroring is pathetic. But I don't use this as almost all the apps that I use are available in fire stick. I tried just to check the feature

  Tried with 2 different TVs of different brands but this fire stick failed to start pairing with the remote. Ordered replacement though dont know will again get defective piece or what. I dont know whats wrong with amazon, since past 2 times the electronic items i order have been sent faulty in the first time, ordering replacements wastes time aswell and amazon will gradually loose customers

  I was bit Skeptical while buying this since I got a Non-Smart TV of Brand Vise(Available only with Vijay Sales & Lotus Electronics)Firestick works perfectly although it took me some time to map Firestick with TV but it worked smoothly.Firestick is working perfectly including TV and Firestick operation.Just one suggestion to developers make remote mapping automatic as it takes a long time to map .

2020 Fire Stick 2021 Remote



  I have always been a fan of Amazon Fire Stick and this is my second device. The remote is a gem.One thing I realised is if it would have a custom button option down below so users can set any app as per their choice. That would be amazing. I suppose Amazon will roll this update this feature in their upcoming releases üôÇenjoying the product. Packaging was ok, the delivery was before the expected date so I am happy.It also works great with monitors with VGA cable connected to a HDMI to VGA converter.The remote doesn't work for me because it's an IR blaster. I expected it to control the volume from the firestick itself because I am using it on my monitor and connected a speaker to it.

Good product



  The streaming stick is fast and responsive. Setup is easy and straightforward. I could not connect the stick directly to the HDMI port as  the ports are very close on my TV and I had other ports occupied too. So I used the provided HDMI extender to connect the stick to the TV. Connecting this way also helps to provide better WiFi connectivity as there is lesser interference from the proximity to the TV.

My  experience



  I bought this for rupees 2,200 in a sale almost 3 months ago and I think this is best product for u if u don't have smart tv. At rupees 2,200 this is the best  for the price . I would don't recommend you to buy this for rupee 3,000 because there are other good options at this price range . If you  are getting this product for below repees 2400 just buy it .Let's talk about the pros and consPros -1. Value for money (I bought this for rupees 2,200)2. Good interface or ui3. Remort quality is good4. Remort can control both tv and fire tv  StickCons-1. Ui lags sometimes2. The ui is based on android but there is  No play store so u can't download many  apps dricectly For given app store (you  can download some of the apps with  another ways3. There is no pendrive slot4. Voice integration is not that good ( like  3.5 out of 5 starsCONCLUSION (must read) - this is best smart tv divice below rupees 2,400 . You should not buy is for rupees 3,000 as there are other options .

Good option but lacks somewhere



  Nice way to convert non smart TV to Smart one. But underperforms in several areas1. User interface is not user friendly, specially the elderly ones faces hard time to manage2. Remote volume and power buttons not pairing with several tv models. Magic eye configuration would have been a better option.3. Alexa voice control is really poor4. Appstore is really missing several good TV apps like ditto TV, Jio Tv etc forcing users to use hacks or buy additional subscriptions integrated TV apps are really poor and provide only FTA channels even after subscriptions. Forcing to rely on individual channel apps like zee 5, Sony LIV, Voot etc with seprate subscriptions  for live TV streaming

I also checked recent review of the product and a lot of users including me are facing same issue with Aug-21 manufactured product. Anyone else that is going to buy the is product in current sale (Oct-21) please give it a thought for now. Maybe buy in next sale and if lucky we won't get Aug-21 manufactured product with issues.

An amazing streaming device!



  I would recommend to buy this only if you have a 1080P resolution Tv because when I plugged it into my 4k TV the resolution was too sharp and didn't seem good at all maybe because it was trying to upscale the resolution to match the TV's resolution. But after plugging into a 1080p screen the resolution was really good. The interface is snappy and personally I had no issues with it.

Great product and makes tv a smart tv with minimal cost.



  Would recommend anyone buying a 32inch or smaller tv to get a non-smart tv from a good brand like Sony / Samsung / LG and then just buy a Fire tv Stick 3rd gen to make it a smart tv.Since 32inch smart-tv's are usually not that smart enough and have limited applications with no voice control. Fire tv stick solves the problem very economically. Would definitely recommend this product.Note: there have been issues lately with Sony Liv app (not working) on fire tv stick (is the reason that I rated it 4 stars overall)

  It‚Äôs not worth the price for two reasons.1. No adequate inbuilt wireless screen share options. The one that is there is not working. Third party softwares are a pain and quality is cheap. I wish I had ordered a different stream stick that offers built in screenshare options, they come cheaper too.2. Inbuilt memory is very less. Device got full with basic streaming apps and one game.they could have done a better job with the fire stick, by giving a good inbuilt screen share and a better memory and ram.Also, in between app navigation to find certain latest episodes is troublesome even with Alexa.It doesn‚Äôt really feel that I have ordered the latest version of fire stick.A lot of innovation still beckons to make it user friendly.

  There is nothing to dislike. My standard led TV is converted into a smart TV. This is a smart device. The device automatically detects the TV brand and updates itself and it's remote to be compatible with the TV. I'm able to control it with my TV remote also, without any setting, which means it aslo works with TV remote smoothly.You don't need to use two remotes, only a single remote can control the TV and stick simultaneously.

Built quality of remote is filmsy



  The software part is flawless, got it in a great deal at 2000. Only drawback and a major one is the remote which is built in China and is of films quality compared to other firestick remotes I have. The firestick is made in India but thr accessories (remote) is made in China.

  This was my first smart tv converter must say it's worth the money. Till now no issues very happy with my purchase, was in doubt before but all you need to know is if you have HDMI port in your tv and good wifi or data option  it's definitely gonna work.

  I returned this item because the listing stated the deal includes Zee5 & SonyLiv 12 months free subscription where as the actual deal is for FireStick PLUS not just fire stick(3rd Gen), make sure you buy the right product according to your preference. They mislead other offer on different listings which gives you an impression that this comes with the free offers.

  Got it for 3300 Rs. For the price quoted, the quality of the remote is not that great. The buttons on the remote is not smooth. Need to find a separate power socket for connecting fire tv stick.

  It works nicely. When I talk to it it amegietly does what I tell it to do for example: Alexa,play classical music. You don't really need to say Alexa but you can if you want to. The blue button is the Alexa button you have to keep that button pressed and then talk to it.

A good quality product for non- smart TV users



  Stream quality is commendable  plus it depends on your broadband connection.. Voice recognition is good but it can be improved.. 80% it gives u what u r looking for.. Volume control is good it provide quite beneficial for me..  As My Samsung TV was not working ... So I had to depend on ALEXA..  Alexa is also a good girl.. It listens to u like a good student and responds according to it

Mindboggling asset for non android tv



  I love this product; I can watch live tv without having a data connection and install almost every app available in the play store.The only this which I am facing issue is with the remote back panel. It seems to be loose, but that's ok because this is an excellent product for any non-Android tv.Trust with Amazon will stay alive

  Very smooth Operating System, No lagging or no delay in response. UI is very cool compare to stock Android. Apple TV support, HDR support in 1080p resolution. I love this remote it is very tiny and cute. Remote build quality is very low if it fall down 2-3 times easily it breaks and YouTube hotkey should have been present instead of Prime music.
